{"0":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHEsuperstition upon which this taIe i\u017f founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabjans itappeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establi shment of Christianity; and it has only a\u017fsumed its prosent form since the division af the Latin and Greok churches; at which time, lhe idea becoming prevalent, that a Lcltin body could not corrvpl if buried in their territory, it gradually increosed, and formed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, \u017ftill extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding uponlhe blood of tho young and beautiful. In the West itspread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of c0nsumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as t0 cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even fr0m the ucry pores of thoir skins.\nIn theLond0n Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to hove accurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of tbe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had bcen beclrd to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the fr0ntiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing him\u017felf with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre him\u017fels; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of hauing 6een tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the lnhabitants havjng consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f ound it (a\u017f is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely lhrough the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out cls dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut ofs his head, burned his body, and threw lhe asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of th ose persons who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.\nThe universa1 belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, arid sucks in his turn.\nChlef bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject of the prcsent o6servations than any other iristance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of pvnishment after doatb, for some hein ous crime commjtted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not anly doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut fir\u017ft on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy cor\u017fe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living cor\u017fe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvr\u017fing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her c heek's last tinge\u2014hor eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freozes o'er its lifeless b1ue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wheri sborn Affcction's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen gravc, Go\u2014arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrjnk away From spcctre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulne\u017fs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciou\u017f Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his greot work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of jts effects, has put forth \u017fome learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.\nMany curious and intcresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may suffiee for the limjts of a note, nece\u017fsarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be conc1uded 6y merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, thcre are scvercll others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms \u017fince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:\u2014thoughin vain:\u2014when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her 's, \u017ftill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;\u2014evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wcls baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the comm0n adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hi\u017f eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang tho\u017fe who sully it by their vices.\nAhout the \u017fame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than hi\u017f judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the vcsting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nhter\u017f at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. Fjnding, however, some compensati0n in bis gratified vanity, he was aboul to reliriqvishhis dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbe vory impossibility of forming an idea of the charocler af a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gaue few other signs of hif obseruation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his irnagination t0 picture every thlng that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inta the ber0 of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather thanthe persori besore him. He became acqv ainted with him, paid him atteritions, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his presenco was alwoys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarrafsod, and soon found, from the notes of preparatlon in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirou\u017f of gaining some informalion respeeling this \u017firigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thot il was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been tbougbl necessary to enoble lbe yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards putti ng themselves upon an equality with the oged, and not allowing them to appear as if falleri froin the skies,whenever scaridalovs intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pralse, accordlrig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-\nttered by such a mark of estcem frorn him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waterf.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and n0w he fovnd, that, though many more of bis actians were exposed to his viow, the results offered different concluslons from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reeeived from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms;\u2014these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when thc profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in hjs lust, or to sink him sti1l deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributedby him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity 0f his Lordship, which was stlll more lmpresfed up0n his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot therewas a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckle\u017fs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cur\u017fing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp-\nerienoed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbj\u017f to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and dld not terid to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hi\u017f eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rny\u017ftery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.\nThey s0on arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circlc of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the memorials of another almost desertod cily. Whilst he wa\u017f thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothirig but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that thcre was an evil power resident in his companion, these soemed to glve hjm sufficienl reason f0rthe belief. His guardians jnsisted upon his immedialely leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresjstible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discouered, that his contempt for the a dultress had not originated in hatred of hercharacter; but thot he had reqvired, to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnclcIe of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hod, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whose cbclracter had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which t0 rest tbe eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the \u017fame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hiin his intenlions wlth respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sont hi\u017f scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving lest Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of anclent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many co1oured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exlsted a being, so beautiful and delicate, thal she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass tbe promised hope osthe saithful in Mahomet's parcldise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plajn, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof hcr becluties; for who would have exchangcd hcr eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gazc of him, who forgot lhe letters he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosl effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-Iike figure. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preseruo a memorjaI for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all thc glowing colours af youthsul memory,the marriage pomp \u017fhe remernbered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjoctsthat had evidentIy madc a greater impre\u017fsion upon her mjnd, would tell him all the superriatural talcs of her nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited tho interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, wha had passed years amidst his fricnds, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon tbe life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existerice for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe citedto him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hirn so incredulous, she begged of him to bclieve her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alway\u017f had some proof giveri, which obljged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve.She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, \u017ftill persisted in persuclding her, that thore could 6e na truth in her fears, though at the same tirne he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to excjte a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\nAubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and whlle he ridjculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to pclrt from him witb roluclarice; but it was becaufe she had rio longer any one with whom sbe could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursion\u017f, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the pla ce, thoy all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must nocessarily pasf through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, vpon any con\u017fideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his darjng thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.\nNext m0rriing Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind lhat his words, mocking the bolief of those horri6le fiends, had lnspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, thal he did not perceive tbat doy-light would soon ond, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidIy gather into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to mako up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediate1y tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wclf above\u2014lts echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst thc blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hi\u017f uery feet. Suddenly his horse toak srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the t0wn, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, fora moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, contjnued iri one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door os the hut. He f0und himsclf in utter darkness: the sound, h0wever, guidedhim. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in c0n tacl with some one, whom he jmmediately \u017feized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" t0 which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had pIaced bis hands upon his thraat\u2014when thc glare of mony torches penetrating through the hole thclt gave light in the day, disturbod him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl momenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke throvgh the wood, was rio longer heard. Thc st0rm was now stiIl; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered; tbe light of their torches fell upon the mvd wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the lighl of tbe torches once mare burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was 6ut a visjon arisirig from hls disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness abaut her foce that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickIy formed, and Au6rey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him thc objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were\u2014his mirid was benumbed and seemcd to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy\u2014he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engagedjn the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. \u2014To describe their grlef would be impossible; but whenthey ascertained the cause 0f their child'f death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointcd to the corse. They were inconsolable; botb died br0ken-hearted.\nAubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirjovs; inthe\u017fe intervals he would ea1l upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe\u2014hy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former compclnion to sparo the being hc loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destrayer. L0rd Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive al Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrisjed and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now com6ined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, iinplying cllmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whichhe showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quile changed; he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had \u017fo astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eonvalescerice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hirn, wilh a smi1e of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo hau-\nntcd him. During the last \u017ftage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clppclrently engaged in watohing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless fun;\u2014lndeed, he appeared to wish to av0id tbe eyef of all.\nAubrcy's mind, by this sbock, was much weokened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of \u017folitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind couId nat find it in tbe neighbourhood of At hens; if he sought it amidsl the ruins hehad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amldst the underwood, jn quest of the m0dest violet; then sudderily turning rovnd, would show, to hls wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crcated such bitter associcltions in hif mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he heId himself bound hy the tender cclre he had taken af him during his illness, that tbey sbouId visit those parts of Greecc neilher had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb o recollectjon covId be attaohed: but thougb they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seomed not ta heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they jmagined were only the invention of individvals, whosc interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus rieglceting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasiori they travellcd with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, wilh large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiees, they had reason t0 repent their negligence; for scarccly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the cchoed report of sevcral guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placirig themselves behind rocks, had hegun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, retired for a moment behjnd the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the r0bbers should climb above and take lhom in the rear, they determlned at once to rush forward jn search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contcst or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, imrnediately thrown up their arms and surrendored.\nBy promises of greal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded fricnd to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pr0mised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's \u017ftrengthrapidly deoreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advanoing with hasty steps. His coriduct and appeorance had not chonged; he seomed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, andhis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his asfistanoe with mare than usucll earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my exj\u017ftence a\u017f liltle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"\u2014\"How? lell me how? I would do any thirig,\" roplied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need bul little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I eannot explain thc whole\u2014but if you would conceal all yau know os ine, rny honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were un kriown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shaIl not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exvltant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year anda day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014Hif eyes se omed burstingfrom their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nA ubrey retired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintoriee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered hls ooth a cold shivering came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment of something horrl6le awaiting him. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he hcld left the corpse, when a robbcr met him, and informed himthat it was no 1ongcr there, having been c0nveyed by himself orid comrades, upon hif retiring, lo the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, aecording to a promife they hcld given his lordship, thal it should he exposed to the first cold ray of tho moon thatrose ofter his declth. Aubrey aftonished, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bvry it upon the spot where it Iay. But, wben be had mounted to lhe summit he sound no trace of either lhe corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they bad laid the b0dy. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that tbey had buried the corp\u017fe for the sake of the cl0lhes.\nWeary of a courilry in which he had met with \u017fuch terrible mjsfortunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he res olved l0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he oceupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheath apparently orriamented in tbo same style as the dogger di\u017fcovered in the fatal hvt\u2014he shuddcred\u2014ha\u017ftening to gain furtber proof, he found tho weapon, and his borror may be imagjned when he discovered that it fitted, though pocuIiarly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed ga2ing to be bound to lhe dagger; yct stilI he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon lhe haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for d oubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Ro me, his fjrst inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and sbe had nat been heard of since lbe departuro of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid lhat this lady had fallen a victiin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted jn urging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which \u017feemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and hc hostened to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gainod his affection, now that the woman began to appear, sbe was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had riot that winnlng grclce wbich gains the gaze and appIause of tbe drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of thclt light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blve oye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm ab0ut it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvl from some feelirig within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was riot that light sooting, which strays whero'er a butterfly ora colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alorie, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her br0ther breat-\nhed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her fmile for that os the uoluptvary? It seemod as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should 6e delayed untiI her brother's returri fromthe continent, when he might be hcr protector. It was now, therefore, resoIved thclt the next drawing-room, which was fastapproaching, should be the epoch of ber entry into the \"bu\u017fy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave reinained in the mansion os his fathers, and fed up0n the ineIancboly which overpowered him. He could not feel interesl about the frlvolities of fashionable strongers, when bis mind had been so torri by the events he had witnessod; but he determined to sacrifice hls own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nTbe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and al1 who were clnxious to bask in the s mile of royally, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all araund him, cngaged in tho remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plaoe\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his eor\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage t0 turn, fearfuI of seeing a spectre that would blast hjm, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice ori this spot upon his first entry into so cicty. He gozed till hls limb\u017f almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and foreing a pa\u017fsage through the crowd, he threw himself irito his carriage, and wos driven home. Hc paced thc room with hurried steps, and fixcd his hands upon bis head, as jf he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances star-\nted up in dreadfvl array\u2014the dagger\u2014bis oath.\u2014He roused himsels, he could nal believe it possible\u2014the dead rise agoin!\u2014He thought his imaginalion had conjured up the image hif mirid was rest-\nirig upon. It was impofsible that it couId be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig vpon his lips, and he eauld not succecd in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection os a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave hiinself up ta his own devouring thovghts.Pcrceiving, at last, that many were leaving, ho roused him\u017felf, and entering another room, found his sister furrounded by several, apparently in earnest canversalion; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, wbom he requested to move, tvrned round,and reveoled lo him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sjster'sarm, and, with hurried step, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting f0r their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again heard that voico whisper eIose to him\u2014\"Remember your oalh!\"\u2014He did not darcto turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.\nAu6rey became cllmost distracted. If befare his mind had been ab\u017forbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engro\u017fsed, now that the certainty of the inonster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain thal she intrcated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt condu ct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, tbe more he was bewildered. His aath startled him;\u2014was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and not avert its progrefs? His very sister mlght hclve been tauched by hlm. But euen if be were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing bis own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days ho remained in this state; shut up in his room,hc fow no one, and ate only when his \u017fister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from streot to stroet, anxious to fly that image whioh haunted hiin. His dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no langer to 6e recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him downto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safoly, employed people to follow him; butthey were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer swister than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily chariged. Struck with the idea thal ho left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to cnter agoin into society, and watcb bim clasely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when heentered into a room, hls haggard and suspicious looks were so st riking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offected hlm so strongly. When, however, remon\u017ftrance proved vnavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whjch had boen bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dai ly encountered in hls wanderings, and of preventirig him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what tbey considered folly, they engaged aphysician to reside iri tbe house, and take conslant care of him. He hard1y appeared to notice it, so completely was bis mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherenee beeame at laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, incapable af being roused. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustrc;\u2014the only sign of afsecti0n and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho enlry of hissister; then hc would sometirnes start, and, sejzing her hands,with looks thal severely afflicted her, he would dosire her not to touch hirn. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your loue for me is aught, do riot go rieor him!\" Wben, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he \u017fank jnto a state, wbence riot even she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the yeclr was passing, his incoherenees became less frequent, and hi\u017f mind tbrew off a portion of its gloom, whil\u017ft his guardians observed, thal severcll t imes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numher, and tben smile.\nThe lime had nearly elapscd, when, up0n the lclst day of the year, one of his guardians enterlng his raom, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrcy's being in so awfu1 a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. InstantlyAubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be presenl at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sist er. They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him. He was apparcntly again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smiIe; for he pressed her tohis breast, and kissed her cheek, wot with tears, fl0wing at the thought of her brolher's bejng once more alive to tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmlh, and to congratvlate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of the monster who had so long inf1uenced his life. He seized tbe portrait ln a paroxysm of rage, and trampIed jt under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then \u017feizing her hands, arid gazing on her with a srantic expression of countcriance, he badeher swear thatshc would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if tbat voice again bade hirn rememberhis oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard lhe whole, and thought this wcls but a return of his disorder, ent-\nered, and sorcing him from Miss Aub rey, desired hcr to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, be begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, attrjbvting thisto the insanjty they imagined had taken possession of hls mind, endeovaured to pocify him, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had beon refused with every one else. Wheri he heard of Aubrey'\u017f ill hecllth, he readily understood himself ta be the cause os it; but wheri he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation andpleasure could hardly be concealed from those among wham he had gained this informatjon. Ho hastoned to the house 0f his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretence os great offection for the brother and intorest in his fale, he graducl1ly wori the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resisl his power? Hi\u017f t0ngue had dangers and toils to recovnt\u2014could speak of himse1f as of an individual having no sympathy with any being ori the crowded earth, save wlth her lo whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew ber, his exislonce, hadbegun to seern worthy of preservation, if it were merely tbat he might listen ta her soothirig aocents;\u2014in fine, he knew so woll how to use the serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, tbat ho gained her affeotions. The title of the elder 6ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hasteningthe marriage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) wbich wa\u017f to take place the very day before hls departure for the contincnt.\nAubrey, when he was lefl by the physician and his guardians, atlempled lo bribo the servclnts, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; hewrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own boriour, and the hon0ur of tho\u017fe now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o fow hovrs that rnarriage, on which hc den0unced the mosl heavy curses. The servonts promised they would deIiver it; bul giving lt to the physicion, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates os the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the nates os busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubrcy grew almost franlic. Thc curiosity of the servants at last overcame thejr vigilance, thoy graduolly slole away, leaving hirn in the custody of an helpless old womari. He seized the apportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a rnoment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takinghis arm hy force, hurried hlm from the ro0m, speechless with rage. When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6ride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So fclying, he pushed him towards his atlend ants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no loriger support hiinself; his ragenat firiding vent, had broken a blood-ves\u017fel, and he was c0nveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, whowas not present when he eritered, as the physician waf afraid of agitatirig her. The marriage was solcmnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion 0f blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his \u017fisler's guardians might bo called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related c0mposedly what the reader haf perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wben they arrived, it was too 1 ate. Lord Ruthven had disclppeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thjrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tbe world was alI beforehim, where to chaose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greeian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18I2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certcliri supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce many British vessels lo visit it\u2014both men of war and merchontmen; and tbough it lies rather out of lhe tra ck for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviotion of a voyage. We landed; as usua1, at the boltom of thc bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myse1f to0k a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticuIe so named) we mct witb and engclged a young Greek as ovr guide, who told us he hcld come from Scio with an English lord, wbo lest the islarid sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pjlot,\" said tbe Greek, \"andwould have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was anodd, bvt a very good man. The cottage over the hil1, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he has left an old mcln in cbclrge of it: ho gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has reslded there about fourteen months, though not constant1y; for he sa ils in his felucca very 0ften to the differont is1ands.\"\nThis account excitedour cvriosity very mueh, and we lost no time in hastening tothe house whore our countryrnan had resjded. We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us ouer the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrclnce hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a6ed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tablcs on ejther side, a large myrtle ln the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which couId be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sitling-ro0m we obscrved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were then in a lclrge seaman's chest jn the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. Ori the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English book of any description. Most of those book\u017f were filled with marginal notes,written wlth a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Messiah was lilerally scri6bled all over, and marked wilh slips of paper, on whioh alsa were remark\u017f.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had bcen reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to rnove one thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; hcis oth erways very good. I oncedid him a service; and I have the produce of tbis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin es which I pay t0 an aged Arrnenian who rcsldes in cl small cottage in the wood, and whom lhe lord brought bero from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanee of the house externally wa\u017f pleasjng. The portico ln frorit was fifly paces Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars witb 6lack pljnths and fret-work cor nices, (as it is now customary jn Grecian architecture,) were confiderably bigher lhan the roos. The roof, surroundedby a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most os thc housc-tops are thuf furni\u017fhed, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we enlered the house, a srnall streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on it\u017f borders, and under thc shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed mariy of his evenings ond nlghts till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" sclid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devo-\nut, \"and always attended our churcb twice a week, besjdes Sundays.\"\nThe view fr0m this seat wcls what may 6etermed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye ta Mount CalcIa, coverod witb olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestio decay. A fmall stream issuing from the ruins descended in brokencascades, untjl il wos losl iri the woads noarthe mouritain's base. The sea smooth as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, lhrough a vista oflofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands werc distinotly observed, \u017ftuddjng the light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a vjew more tban I djd this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wha had gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armeniari,\" said ovr c0nductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he wlll not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I con,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tirne to vlsit the Armenian, 6ut on ovr return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho hod portioned eight young girlswhen he was la\u017ft vpon tbe lsland, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, ond cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a newboat for a fishermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave GreekTestamonts to tho paor children. In \u017fhort, he appeared to us, from all we coIlected, to have been a very ecoentric and benevoIent character. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at thc c otlage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daugbter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he hod bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch wa\u017f the information with which we departed from the peaeeful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on tbe rack, guessjng who this rambler iri Greece cavld be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and alI those eccenlrioities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovhtf were dispelled. FaIlingin compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travols on the ifland of Tenedos, arid I al\u017fo visited hirn at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordsbip's fame, as we bad been some years fram home; but \"Chi1de Harolde\" being put into our hond\u017f we recognized the recluse of Calcla in overy page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we corisolcd ourselvef with the idea of returning t0 Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never retum. I make thls statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordsbip's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been dcscribcd as of an unfeeling dlsposition, avcrse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its forrows, or add lo jts pIeasures. Tbe fact is directly tho reverse, o\u017f may be plalrily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feolings of the heart, sa elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of \u017folitude is an additional reason for marking hjm cls a being on whosc heart Reljgion bath set her seal, and over whosehead Benev0lence hath thrown her inontle. No man can rcad the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a eountryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an oplnion. Reports are ever tobe received with caut-\nion, pclrticularly wheri directed against man'\u017f moral integrity; arid be wbo dares juslify bimself beforc that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony 0f a virtuous heart andself-approving conscierice.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","1":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE svperstition upon which lhis tale is founded ls uery general in the East. Among the Arahians it appears to be eommon: it did not, hawever, extend itsels to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greckchurches; at which timc, the idea becoming prevalent, thal a Lalin body could nol eorrupt if bvried in their tcrrjtory, it gradually iricreased, and formed the subject of mony wondorful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their gravos, and feeding upon the blood of the young and bcautiful. In the Wesl it sprecld, wilh some slight variation, aIl over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the bolief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion af the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strenglh, and speedily died of consumptions; whil\u017ft these hum an blood-suckers fattened\u2014and theirveins bcoame distended lo such o state of repletion, cls to cau\u017fe the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn tbe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hurigary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commclnder-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pofitive1y and urianiinously afsjrmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassavia, on lhe frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of thc euil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing hirnself with his blood. This pr ecaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, a6out twenty or thirty days after his deoth and burial, many persons complained of having been t0rmented by him, and a depositlon was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitarits having confulted their Hadagni, took up tbe body, and found il (as is supposed lo be usual in ca ses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptian, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proaf having been thus obtained, lhey res0rted to the accustomed rernedy. A stake wcls driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have oried ovt as dreadfully as if he had been aljve. Thi\u017f dono, thoy cut off his head, burned his body, arid threw lhe a\u017fhes into his grave. Thc samc moclsures were adopted wlth the corses of lhase persans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belicf is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vompyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief balliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is here related, because it seems better adapted to j1lustrate the sub ject os the present ohservations than any olher instance which could be adduced. In many partsof Greece it is consi dered as a sort af punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased i\u017f not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal uisitatjons solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eorth, asVampyre serit, Thy corse shall from its lomb be rent; Then ghastly h aunt the natiue pIace, And suck thc blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wifo, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yetloathe the banquet which perforcc Must feed thy livid living corsc, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, ShalI know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on tbe stem. Bul one thal for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, ShaIl bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word sholl wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's 1ast tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glanoe must view Which free2es a'er its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed harid sha1l tear The lresses of her yellow hair, Os which, in lifc a lock when shorn Affectjon's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, ond hagg-\nard lip; Then ftalklng to thy fullen gravo, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in harror shrink away From spectre more accursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey bos also introduced in his wi1d but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Orieiza, whois represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of torinenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted srom the sinfulness of her life, she being povrtrayed throughout the whole of the lale os a complete type of purity and innoeence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of severaI astonishing cases af vampyrifm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmot, in hif great work vpon this subject, befides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narr atives illustrative of its effects, bas put forth s0me loarned dissertalians, teriding to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and lnteresting notices on lhis singvlarly horrib1e superstiti0n migbt be added; lhough the present may suffice f0r the limits of a no te, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several otbers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts ofthe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations otlendant upori a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the lcaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than hls rank. He gazed upon the mirlh around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe light laughter of the sair onlyattracted his atlention, that he might by a l0okqvell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt thif sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing vpon the obiect'ssace, did not seom to penetrate, and at ane glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaderi ray thclt weighcd upon the skin it oould not pass. His peeuliarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been aceustomed to violenl excitement, and now fe1t the weight of ennui, were pleosed at having somcthing in their presence capa6le of engaging their attention. In spite of the doadly hue oshis faco, which never gained a warmer tint, either from lhe blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters af ter notoriety attemptod to win his attenlions, and gain, at least, same inarks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-r0oms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put ori lbe dress af a mountebank, to attracl his notice:\u2014tbough jn vain:\u2014when she stood hefore him, tbough his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was basfled, and she left thefield. But though the common adultress could not irifluence even the guidclnce of his eyes, it was n0t that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was the apparent cautian with whieh he spoke to thc virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew hc ever addressed himself to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whetber it was that it euon ouercame the dread of his singular charocter, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among thofe females who formthe boast of lhoirsex from their domestic virtues, as arnong thase who sully it by their vices.\nAb0ut the same time, there came ta Londan a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the po\u017fsession of great weoltb, by parents who died while ho was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his f0rtune, while thoy relinquished tbe rnore imporlant charge of his mind to the care of merconary subalterns, he cultivated more his iinaginatian tban his judgment. He had, bence, thal high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which daily ruiris so many milliners' apprentioes. He believed all to sympclthise wjth virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the piclurosque effecl of the scene, as we see in romances: he lhought thot the misery of a cottage inerely consifted in the vesting os clotbes, whicb were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He tbought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Hewas handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon hif entering inlo the gay circles, mclny motbers surrounded him, striving which should deseribo with least truth their languishirig or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their br ightening countenances wheri he a pproached,and by their sparkling eyes, wheri he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ro monce of bis solitary hours, he was startled at findirig, that, except inthe tall0w and wax candles that slickered, not from tho presence of a ghost, but from want of sriufflng, there was no foundatian in real 1jfe for any of tbat congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from whlch ho had formed his sludy. Finding, however, some compensation in his grotifjed vanity, he waf about to reliriquifh his dreams, wheri the extraordlnary being we have above described, crossed him jn his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility af f0rming an idea0f the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gaue fow 0ther signs of his obfervation of oxternal objccts, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatjon to plcture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed thls objoct irito the hero of cl romanco, and determined to observe the offsprjrig 0f hjs fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advclriced upon his notice, that his pre\u017fonoe was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven'\u017f affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street,lhat he was a6out to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, ti1l now, had on1y whetled his curiofity, he hinled t0 his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thovght necessary lo enoble the y0ung to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an eqvality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fa1len from the skies, whenever \u017foandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects af pleasantry or of praise, accordirig t0 the degree os skill shewri in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his interitioris to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive frorn him a proposol to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, appareritly, had nothlng iri common with other men, he gladly accepted il, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, though many inore of his clctions were exposed to his view, the results offer ed different conclusians from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagobond, arid the beggar, received fromhis hand more lhan enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey covld not avold remarking, that it was not vp0n the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon virtve, that he bestowed his olms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligclte came to ask somelhirig, not to relieve his warits, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, howeuer, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, wblch generally preuai1s over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigcnt. There was one circvmstance about tbe charity of his Lordship, which was stillmore impressedupon his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there waf a curse upon it, for tbey were all either led to lhescaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the m0st abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which thoy passed, Aubr ey was svrprizod at lhe apparent eagerness with which hls companion sought for the centres of all fashioriabIe vice; thero he entered into aIl the spirit af the fara table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he losl even more than he gained; but it wa\u017f always wjth the some unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash yovthful n0vice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortu ne's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than thcll of the cat whilst dallying with the haIf-dead mouse. In cvery town, he left the formerly affluerit youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fale that had drawn him within thc reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, omidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, wlthout a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewith to buy evcn sufficient to satisfy their present crauing. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately l0st, to tho ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innoccnt: this might but be the result of o ccrtain degree of knowledge,which was not, however, copoble of combating the cunriirig of the more exporienced. Aubrey often wished to represcnt this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleclsure which praved the ruin of alI, and did not tend to bisown profit;\u2014but he dolayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speakjng fronkly and openly to him; however, this never oecvrred. Lord Ruthvenin his carriage, ond amidst the vari-\nous wild andrich scencs of nature, was always the same: his eye fpoke less than his lip; and tbaugh Aubrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greclter gratification from it than the conftarit excitemcnt os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hjs exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somelhing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; be left hjm in daily ottendonce upon the mornlng circle of an Italjan countess, whilsl he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arriued fromEngland, which he opened wilh eagor impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathing nothing but clffection; the others were frorn his guardians, the latter astonished hjm; jf it had beforc enterod into his imaginatiori that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for tho helief. His guardians insjsted upon his lmmediatoly leaving his friend, and urged, tbat his character waf droadfully uicious, for that the possession of irresisti6le po wers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerovs to society. It had been discovered, that his conternpt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required, ta enhance his gratification, that his viclim, the partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to tbe lowest abyss af infclmy and degradation: in fine, that all those fo males whom he hod sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mosk aside, ond had not scruplod lo expose the who1e deformity of their vices to the public goze.\nAubrey determined upon leclving one, whose cbarocter had not yet shown a single brjght point ori which ta rest the eye. He resoIved to invent some plavsib1e pretext for abandoning him altogetber, purposing, in lhe mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circumstances pclss by unnoticed. He entered irito the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshlp was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of thc lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom thclt an unmarried female is met with iri soclety; he was thereforo obliged to car ry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye sollowed him in all his wlndings, and soondiscovored that an assignalion had been appointed, which would most likely ond in the ruin of an innooent, lhough thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he enterod the apclrtment of Lord Ruthven,and abruptly asked him his intentians with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his 6elng about to meet hcr tbat very night. Lard Ruthveri anfwered, thclt his intentioris were such as he supposed all would have upon such an accasiori; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely lavghed. Aubrey retired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, tbat from that moment he must dcclirie accompanying his Lordfhip in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her os all be knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also ooneerning the character of his Lordship. The assig nation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servont to notify his complete asserit to a soparation; but did not hint any suspiclon of his plans havlng beon foiled by Aubrey's iriterpositlon.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed bis steps t0wards Greece, and crossing the Periinsula, soon found himself at Atbens. He then fixed hjs residence in the house os a Greek; and \u017foon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of clncient glory upori monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronieling the deeds of freemen anly before slaues, bad hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil 0r rnany coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himfelf, existed a being, so beautisul and delicato, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on cariva ss lhe promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think fhe could belong to those who bad n0 foul\u017f. As she danced uponlhe p1 ain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would bave thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for thal sleepy luxvrious look of the animcll suited but to the taste of an epicvre. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the vneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, show the who1c beauty of her form, floclting as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot lhe letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tress es falling, as sbe flitted arourid, exhibit in the sun's ray svch delicately brilliant and swift1y fading hves, jt might well excuse lhe forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind thevery object be hod before thought of vita1 importclnco to the proper interpretation os a passclge inPausanias. But why clt tempt to descrlbe charms whieh all feel, but none cari appreciate?\u2014It was jnnocence, youth, and 6eauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew thoseremains of which he wished ta preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and walch the magic effectf of bis pencil, in tracing the scencs os her native p1ace; shc would then describe to him the circling donceupon the open plain, would palnt, to him in all the glowing c0lours of youtbful memory, the marriage pomp she rememhered viewing iri her infancy; and theri, turning to subjects tbat had evidenlly made a greater impression uponber mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nvrse. Her earnestness and apparerit belief of what \u017fhe narrated, excited the interesteven of Aubrey; and often asshe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of alovely female to prolang his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run oold, wbilst he attempted to lavgh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited lo him the nclmes of old men, who had at last detected one liuing among themseIves, after several of their near relatives and children had heen found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite;and when she found him so increduI0us, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, thal those who bad dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged tbem, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of thcse monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate desoription of Lord Rulhuen; he, however, still persjsted in persuading her, that there cou1d be rio truth in her fears, thovgh at the same time he wondercd at lhe many coincidences which had all tended to excjto a belief in thesupernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAuhrey began to attach himfelf more and mare to Ianthe; herinnocence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtuef of the women among wbom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; andwhile he ridieuled the idea of a young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming aplan forsome antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to retvrn until his object was attained; but he always found it iinpossible to fix bif attention upon tbe ruins aroundhim, whilst in his mind he reta iried an irnage that seemed alone the righlful possessor of hls thaughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frclnk infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part fr0m bim wilh reluotance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilsl ber guardian wcls occupied in sketohing or uricovering some fragment wbich had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subjeet 0f Vampyres, and they both, with several present, afsirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very namo. Soon after, Aubreydetermjned to proceed upon one of his exeursions, whjcb was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard tbo narne of the place, they all at onee begged af him not to return at night, as he musl necessari1y pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the dcly had closed, upon any consideratiori. They described it as thc resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made llght of their representations, and triedto Iaugh them out of the idea; but when he saw thcm shudder at bis daring thus to mock a superior, inf ernal powcr, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Avbrey set off upon his excursion unattcnded; he was surprised to observe the melanchaly face of his host, and was eoncemed to find thclt hls words, mocking the belies of those horrible fiends, hod jnspired tbem with fuch terror. When he was aboul to depart, Ianthe came t0 tbe side of his horse, and earneslly begged of him to return, cre night allowed the power of these beingf to 6e put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, fo occupied in his research, that he did nol perceive that day-light would soori end,and thal ln the harlzon there was one of thase specks whieh, iri thc warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage vpon the deuoted country.\u2014He at lclst, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed sor his delay: but it was too late. TwiIight, in these sovthern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the powcr of lhe slorm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced itswcly through the canopying fo1iage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and rcldiate at hi\u017f very feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carricd with dreadful rapidity through the entclngled forest. The ariimal at last, lhrough satlgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of Iightning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itse1f up from the masses of dead lcaves and 6rushwood w hich surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping lo find some one to guide him lo the t0wn,or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, al1owed him to hear the dreadful shriekf of a womon mingling with thestifled, exultclrit mockery of a laugh, continued in ono almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused hy lhe thunder which agairi r0lled over his head, he, with a sudden esfort, foroed open the daor of lhe hut.He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, thovgh he called, still the sounds continued,and no notice was taken of hiin. He found himself in conlact wilh some one, whom he immediately seized; when a vojce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by ono whose strenglh seemed fuperhuman: detcrmined lo sell his life as dearly cls he cauld, he slruggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet ond hurled with onormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upori his breast, had placed his hands vpon his throat\u2014when the glare af many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in tho day, disturbed him;\u2014he instaritly rofe, and, leaving his prey, rushed througb lhe door, and in a moment the crashing of lhe branche\u017f, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablo of moving, was soon heard by th0so without. They entered; tbe light of their torches foll upon the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darknesf; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought ina lifeless corse. He shut his cyes, hoplng that it waf but a vlsion arifing from his disturbed imagiriatjon; but be again saw the same form, when be unolosed tbem, stretched byhis fide. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacblng as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was bIood, and upon ber throat were the marks of toeth having opened the vein:\u2014lo this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, arid Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been tohim the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fclllen with lho flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thaughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge iri vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger os a particular construction, which had heen sound in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engoged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached tho city, farewarned the parents 0f some dreadfu1 catastrophe. \u2014To desori6e their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained lhe cause of their child's death, they looked al Aubrey, and pointod to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAvbrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most uiolent fever, and wa\u017f often delirious; in these intervals he would caIl upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unclccountable combinati0n he seemed ta heg of his foriner companion to sparo the bcing he loved. Al other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avbroy, immediately placed himself in the same houso, and bocame his c0nstarit attenda nt. When the lattcr recoverod from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight 0f hlm whose imclge he had now combined wilh that of a Vompyre; 6ul Lord Ruthven, by bis kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault thal bod caused thelr separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and carc which he showed, soon reconolled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appcared that apathetic belng who had so aftonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalescence began to he rapid, he again gradually retired jnto the same state 0f mind, and Aubrey percejved no difference from the former man, except that at tjmes he was surpri\u017fed to meel his gaze fixed intently upon him, witb a smile of malicjous oxultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During tbe last stage of the invalid's recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watching tbe tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marklng the progress of those orbs, circ1ing, like our world, the inoveless suri;\u2014irideed, hc appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distjnguished him riow secmed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of \u017foljtude and silence cls Lord Ruthven; but mucb as hc wished for solitude, his mind c0uld nat find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had farinerly frequonted, Ianthe's form ftood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step wovld appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then svddenly turning round, would show, to hls wild imaginalion, her pale face ond wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Hc determined to fly \u017fcenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he beld himself bound by the tender care he had taken ofhim during his illnes\u017f, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had yot seen. They travelled in every direction, and saught every spot to wbicha recollcction could be attached: but thovgh they thus hastened from plaoe lo place,yet they soemed not t0 heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to \u017flight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuaIs, whose intereft it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended srom pretended dangers. In corisequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jnh-\nabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guidef than as a dofence. Upon entering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whicb was the bcd of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from the neighbouririg preeipjces, they had reason to repent their negl igence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engagcd in the narrow pa ss, whon they were startled by tbe whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In cln instant their guards had 1eft them, and, placingthemselves behind rocks, had begun to flre iri the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retjred far a moment behind the shelteririg turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained 6y a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exp0sed to unrcsi\u017ftlng slaughter, if any of thc robbers should climb abovc and take them in therear, they deterrnined at once to rusb forward ln seorch of the enemy. Hardly had they 1ost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his ossistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was saon surprised by seeing the robbers' faees around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately lbrown up their arms ond surrendered.\nBy promises of great roward, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring oabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content morely to guard the entrance till their comrade shauld return with the promiscd sum, for whlch be had an order. Lord Ruthven's ftrength rapid1y decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death \u017feemed advancing with hasty stops. His coriduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objectsabout him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mlnd became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance wjth more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! y0umay save me\u2014you may do more than tbat\u2014I mean not my lise, I heed the dcath of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may \u017fave my honour, your fricnd's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but litlle\u2014rny lifo ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conccal all you kriow of me, my honour were free from stain in thc world's mouth\u2014arid if rny death were unknown for some tiine in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall nol be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying rnan, raising himself with cxulta nt violerico, \"Swear by all your soul reveros, by clll your nature foars, swear that, sor a yeclr and a day you wiIl n0t impart y0ur knowledgo of my crimes or deatb to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, ar whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyos seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circurnstances attending his aoquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when hc remembered his oath a cold shiveririg came ovcr him, as jf from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rifing early in thc morriing, be was about to enter the hovel in which he bad left lhe corpse,when a robber mcl him, and informed him that it was no loriger there, baving been conveyed by himseIf and oomrades, upon his retiring, lo the pirinacle of a neighbourjng mounl, accordjng to a promise they had g iven his lordship,thal it should be exposed to the first cold ray of tbe moon that rose afler his death. Aubrey astanished, and tclking several of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot whore it lay. But, when he had maunted to thc \u017fummit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothos, thougb the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on whlch they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewjldered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that thoy had buried the c orpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had se ized vpon bis mind, he resolued to leave jt, arid soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Noples, he occu pied himsels in arranging those esfects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there was cl case c0ntaining severaI weapons of offerice, more or lefs adapted to ensure tho death of the victim. There were sevcral daggors and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and cxaminirig thejr curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented jn tbe samc flyle as lhe dagger discovered ln thefatoI hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening t0 gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that jl fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further eertainty\u2014they seemed gazirig to be bound to the daggor; yet still he wished to disbelicve; but tbe particular form, the some uorying tints upan the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and lefl no room for douht; there were also drops of blood on oach.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthueri's seduclive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rulned, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind becamc almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilioris, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted bim to the English shorc\u017f; and he hastened to the mansion of his fclthers, and there, for a momont, appeared to lose, in the embrace\u017f and caresses of his sister, all mcmory of the past. If she bes0re, by her infantine caresses, had gairied hjs affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winnirig grace which gains lhe gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was n0ne of that lighl brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity os the mind beneath. There was a meloncholy chclrm about it whicb did not seem to arise srom misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicalo a \u017foul conscious of abrighler realm. Her step was not that light footing, whlch strays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alono, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew de\u017ftroyed hjs resl, who would have exchanged ber smile for that of the volupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face wore then playing in the light of lheir own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's returnfrom the continent, wheri he might be her prolectar. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy sccne.\" Aubrey would rather have remained iri the mansion of his fclthers, and fed upon thc melancholy which overpowered him. He oould not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionahle slrangerf, when bis mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he detormined to sacriflce his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soori arrlved in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced af a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was oxcessive\u2014a drawing-room bad nol been held for a lang time, and all wha were anxiovs to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was tbere with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of a11 around him, engaged in the remembrance tbat the first time he had feen Lord Ruthveri was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a vo ico he recognized too well, soun-\nded in his ear\u2014\"Remember yovr oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearfulof seejng a spectre tbot would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the samc figure which had attrocted his n0tice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazod till bis limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of clfriend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himseIf into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thaughtswere bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadsul array\u2014the dagger\u2014 hif ooth.\u2014He roused himfelf, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the jmage his rnind was resting upon. It was impossible that it cov1d be real\u2014he dotermjned, thereforc, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask cancerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upon hif lips, and he cauld not succeed in galning information. He went a few nights after with his sistor to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired irito a recess, and lhere gave himself up lo hi\u017f own devouring thovghts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entcring anolher room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparentIy in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requosted to move, turned round, ond reveaIed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprangforward, seized his fister's arm, and,with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himsolf impeded by tbo crowd of servants who were waiting for theirlords; and while he waf engaged jn passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey becaine almost distracted. Is beforc hjs mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrofsed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister'f atterilions were now vnheeded, and lt was in vain that shc intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupl conduct. He 0nIy uttered a few words, and those terrifiod her. The more hc thought, the more he was bewildered. His oclth start1ed hi m;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, am idst alI he held dear, and riat avert its progress? His very sister mjght bclve been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclase his suspicions, who would believe him? He thoughl of employing his ownhand to free the world from such a wrctch; bul death, he remembered, bad been already moeked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his \u017fisler eame, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer copable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image whicb haunted him. His dres\u017f became neglected, and hc wandered, as osten cxposod to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to he recognized; at first he returned wilh the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue ouerlook him. His sister, anxiou\u017f for his safety, employed people lo fo1low him; but they were soori distanced by him who fled froin a pursuer swifter than clny\u2014frorn lhought. His conduct, however, suddonly changed. Struek witb the idea that he left by hisabsence tbe whole of his friends, witb a fiend among\u017ft them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hif oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and sufpjcious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, tbat his sister was at last obljged to beg of him to abstain from soeking, for her sake, a fociety which affected him so strongly. Wh en, hawever, remonstranoe proved unavoiling, the guardians thought proper to intorpose, and, fearing that his mind was bccoming alienated, they thaught it high time to resume agajn that trvst which hod been before imposed upan thcm by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him frorn the injuries ond sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandcrings, and of preventing him from exposing to lhe general eyc those rnarks of what they considered folly, they engaged a phyfician to residc in tbe hovse, and take can\u017ftant care of him. He hardly appearcd to notice it, so complelely was his mind absor6ed by one terrible fubiect. His incoherence became at last so greot, that he was confined to his choinber. There he would often lie for days, incclpablc of being roused. He had become emaoiated, his eyes had attained a gIassy lustre;\u2014the only sign 0f affection and recallection remairiing displayed ilseIf upon lhe entry of bis sister; then he would sometimes ftart, and, seizing her hond\u017f, with looks tbat severely afflicted her, be would desire her riot to t0uch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love sor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his onIy answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank inlo a slate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year wcls passing, his incoheren ces became less frequont, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observcd, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a dofinitc number, and then smile.\nThe time had rioarly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the year, ono af his guardians entering his r0om, hegan to converse wilh his physiciari upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri hjs sister was going next dcly to be married. Instontly Aubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this rnark of rcturning intellect, of which tbey fe ared he had been deprived, they mentionod the name af the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey secmed pleased, arid astonished them stil1 more by his expressing his interition to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sistor. They answered not, but jn a sew rninute\u017f his sister wa\u017f with him. He was apparently again capablo of beirig affected by the influonce 0f her lovely sinile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her hrother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He begcln to speak withall hi\u017f wonted warmth, and to corigratulale her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a locket upon bcr breast; openirig ll, what wos hif surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his ljfe. He seized the portrait iri a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he Iaoked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing 0n her with a frclntic expression os countenarice, he bade her swear that she would neuer wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could n0t aduance\u2014it seemed as if thal voiceagain bade hjm remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lho meantime the guardians and physician, who had heord tbo whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Misf Aubrey, desired ber to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, ho begged of them to delay but for one day. They, altributirig this to the insonity they imagined had taken posses\u017fi0n of his mind, endcavourod to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had callcd the morning after the drawing-room, and had heen refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill heallh, he readily vnderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from t hose among wbom he had gained this inforrnotion. He hastened to tho bouse of hjs former companion, ond, by constant attendarice, and the pretonoe of great clffection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gra-\ndually won the ear of Miss Aubrcy. Who cou1d resist his power?His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of bimself as of an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to wh0m he clddresfed hjmself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, hisexistence, had bcgun to seem worthyof preservatjon, if it were merely that he might li\u017ften to her soothing clccents;\u2014in fino, he knew so well how lo use lhe serpent's art, 0r such was the will of fate, that he gained her affeclions. The title of the elderbranch falling at length lo him, he obtained an important embassy, whicb served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (ln spite of her brother's deranged slato,) which wasto take place lhe very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and hjs guardians, attemp ted to bribe the servonts, but in vain. He asked f0r pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuririg her, as sbe ualued her own happiness, hor own horiour, and the honovr of those nowin the grave, who once held her in their arms as thejr hope and the hope of their housc, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the m0st heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physjcian, he thought it better not to haross any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without resl to the busy inmatesof the house; andAubrey heord, with a horror that may more easily be conceivedthari described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound os carriages broke upon his ear. Aubroy grew almast frantjc. The curiosity of tho scrvants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole aw ay, leavinghim in the custody of an helples\u017f old woman. He seized lhe opportvnity, with one hovnd was out 0f tbe room, and in a moment found bimself in the apclrtrnent where all werc riearly asscmbled. Lord Ruthven was the first t0 perceive him: he immediately approac hed, and, taking his arm by f0rce, hurried him froin the room, speechless with rage. When 0n the stairoase, Lord Ruthveri whifpered in his ear\u2014\"Remembcr your oath, and kn ow, if not my bride to day, yaur sisler is dishonovred. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards hls attendants, who, roused hy the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer fupport himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessol, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned t0 his si\u017fler, who wcls not present whcn he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitatirig her. The marrlage was solernnized, arid lhe bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrcy's weakness iricreased; the efsusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of dcath.He desjred his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to ch0ose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing throu gh the Grccian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the har6our 0f Mitylene, in the island of lhat name. The beauty of this plaoe, and the certain supp1y of cattle and vogetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit il\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and lhough it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tbe deviati0n of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were emp1oyed in watering, and the purser bargalning for cattle with the nativcs, the clergyman and myself took aramble to the cave called Homer's School, clnd olher plaees, where we had been besore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticu1e so named) we met with and engclged a young Greek as our guide, who t0ld us he had come from Scio wjth an English lord, who left tbe is1and four days previou\u017f to our arrival jn his felucca. \"He erigaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wouldbave taken me with him; but I did not chooso to qult Mltylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but avery good man. The cottage over the hill, sacing the river, 6elongs to bim, and he has 1est an old man iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred 2echines for it, (about L25O English curroncy,) and has resided t here about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different island\u017f.\"\nTbis account excited our euriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryrnan had resided. Wc were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us overthe mansion. It cansisted of four apartinents on lhe ground-floor\u2014ari ent rarice hall, a drclwing-r0om, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed.They were all sirnply decorated: plain green-slained wa1ls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in tbe centre, and a small fountoin berieath, which could bemade to play tbrough the 6ranches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning po\u017flure; a largo couch or sofa compleled the furniture. In the haIl stood holf a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were rio mirrors, rior a slrigle pointing. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilt\u017f and a pil1ow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the sitting-room we observed a mclrble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were theri in a largc seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works eomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empire\u017f; Zimmerman, in the Germ ari langvage; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's playof the Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Lost, ari Italian odition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greok press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were f illed with marginal notes, writtcn with a pencil, in ItaIian arid Latin. Tbe Mesfiah was literally seri6bled all over, and marked with s1ips of paper, on which al\u017fo were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiing before he scliIed, and forgot to ploce them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his relurn; for he is so particulclr, that were I to move one thlng without orders, he would frown upon me for a week logether; he is olherways very good. I once did him a service; and I havc the produce of thjs farm for lhe troubleof taking care of it, except twerity zechines which I pay to an clged Armenian who rosides in a small cottoge in the wood, and whom the lord hrought here froin Adrianople; I don't know sor whot reason.\"\nThe appearance 0f the house externaIly was plcasing. The portico in front wa\u017f fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pllnths and fret-work eornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) wereconsiderobly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a lighl stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awriing of strorig coarse linen.Most of the house-top\u017f are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pclss their evenings in smoking, drinking light winos, such os \"lochryma christi,\" eating frujt, and enjoying tho evening breeze.\nOn the left hclnd as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lirnes were clustering togetber on its borders, ond undcr the sbade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooderi back was placed, ori which we wcre to ld, the lord passed mony of his evenings and nights till twelve a'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prayirig\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended ovr church twice aweek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view fromthis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A 1ino os rich virieyards led the eye to Mount CaIcIa, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on thesummit of whlcb an ancienl Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small strcam issuing from the ruins descended jn brokeri cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. Tbesea smooth as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninate\u017f the view in front; and o little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-treef, several \u017fmall isIand\u017f wcro distinctly 0bserved, studding the light blue wave with spots of cmerald green. I seldom enjoyed a vlew m0re thcln Idid this; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the name of the person who bcld resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bankcr, who had gone to Cand-\nia.\"The Armenian,\" sald our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tcll, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" Webad not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the lown we lear nl several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was 1ast upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuplial feast. He gaue a cow t0 one man, horses to athers, and cotton and \u017filk to the girls wbo live by weavlng these arliclef. Hc also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor chil dren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collectcd, to have been avery eccentric and benevolent character. Onecircumstance we learnt, whjoh our old frierid at the cotlage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most boautiful daughter, with whom tbelord wos oftenseen walking an the sea-shore, and he hcld bought her o piano-farte, and taught her himself the usc of it.\nSucb was the information wilh which we departed fr0m the peaceful islc of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, gvessing who this ramb1er in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geniu\u017f. Arrived at Palermo, alI our dovbts wcre dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupi1 of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiaus, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had ncver then heard of hjs lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaraIde\" being put into our hands wc recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having 6een more curious in our rosearche\u017f at thc cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on s0me future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, beljeving it not qujte uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly sIandered. He has beon described as of ori unfeeling disposition,aver\u017fe to a\u017fsociating with humcln nature, or contri6uting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverfe, as may be plainly gathercd srom these little anecdates. All thc finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his l0rdship's poems, \u017fcem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, sympatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting tho repose of solitude is an additional reason for markirig him cls a bcing on whose heart Religion hath set her seol, and ovcr whose head Benevolerice hclth thrown her mantle. No inan can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him os a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I d0 not assume a right to give an opjnion. Reports are evcr to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integri ty; and he who dares justify hiin\u017felf beforo thal awfultribunal where all mvst appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron'scharacter is worthy af his genius. To do good in secrot, and shun the world's applause, is the surost testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","2":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in lhe East. Among the Ar abians it appeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to lhe Greeks until ofter the establlfhrnent of Christianity; and it has only ossumed its presont form since the divisiori of the Latjn and Greek churohcs; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thot a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradua1ly increased, and formed the subjoct of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood 0f lhe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with same sligbt variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and L0rraine, whcre the helief cxjstod, that vampyres nightly lmbibed o certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciatcd, loft their strength, arid speedily died of consuinptions; whjlst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their uein\u017f became distended to such a stateof repletiori,as lo cause the blood to flow srom all the passages of their bodies, and even fram the very pores of tbeir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accourit of a particular case of vampyrjsm, which is stated to haue occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chlef and magistrates of lhe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had bcen heard to say, that,at Cass0via, on the frontiers of lhe Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid hlmself of the evil, by eating some os the earth out os the vampyre's grave, and rvbbing himself with his blood. This preoaution, however, did not p revent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, clboul twenty or thirty daysafter his death and bvrial, many persons complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposilion was made, that four porsons had been deprived of life by hif attacks. To provent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposcd to be vsual in cases af vampyrism) frosh, and entirely free from corrvption, and emitting at the movth, n0se, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomcd remedy. A stake was driven entireIy through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is rep0rted to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they out osf his bead, 6urnod his body, and threw the ashesinto his grave. The same measures were adopted witb the corses of those persons wb0 bad proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived tbem.\nThe uriiversal helief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre beoomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate tbe subjoct of the presont ob\u017fervotions than any other inslance which covld be addvced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in existcncc, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his inferna1 visitations solely to lhase beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whorn he was bound by tief of kindred and affectjon.\u2014A supposition aIluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut flr\u017ft on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghostly haunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sjster, wife, At midnight draln the stream of lifo; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed tby livid livirig corse, Thy victims, ere tbey yol expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers are wjthered on the stem. Bvt onothal for thy crime mvst fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flaino! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's laslspark, And thelast glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhclllowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a look when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne awcly by thee Memorial os thine agony! Yet with thirie own best blood sbclll drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in horror shrink away From spectre inore accur\u017fed tban they.\nMr. Southcy hos also introduced in his wild but beautifulpoem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of tbo Arabian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned sram the grave for tbe purpose of tormenting bim she best loved wbilst in existencc. But thi\u017f cannot bo supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed throughovt the whole of the tale as a compIete type of purity arid innooence. The veracio us Tournefort gives a long account in bis travels of several astonishing eases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratiues jllustrative of its esfects, has put fortb some learned dissertations, tending to prove it t0 be a classical, as well as borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrihle superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, andwhich moy now be coricluded by merely remarking, that thougb the term Vampyre is the one in most generaI acceptation, there are severa1 others synonymous with it, made use of iri various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipation\u017f attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the Ieaders of the ton a nobleman, more remclrkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon lhe mirth around him, af if ho could riotparticipate thcrein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awc, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whjcb, fixing upon the objec t's face, did not seem to penetrale, ond at one gIarice to pierce thr0ugh ta the inward workings of the heart; but fell upan the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarjlies caused him to be invited to every housc; a1l wished to see him, and those wh0 had been accvslomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, wero plea\u017fed at having somothing in their pre\u017fence capclble of engclging their attcntion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never galned a warmer tint, either from thc blush of modosty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline wore beautiful, many of the female bunters afler notorjety attempted to win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of whclt they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn jn drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did allbut put on the dress of a mountebank, ta attract his riotice:\u2014though in vairi:\u2014wheri she stood before him, though his eyes were apparontly fixed upan her's, still il seemed as if lhey were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence wasbaffled, and she left the fiold. But thovgh the common adultress could not influenceeven the guidance of his oyef, it was not that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was lhe apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, thal few knew he ever addressed hjmself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a win ning tongue; and whether it was tbat it even overcamo the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparont hatred of vice, he was as often among those female\u017f wh0 form the boast af their sex from their do mestic virtuos, asamong thosc who su1ly it by the ir vices.\nAbout the somo timo, there came to London a young gentlernan of the name of Avbrey: he was ori orphan 1eft with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alsolo himself by guardians, who thoughl it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquishod thc more important charge of bis mind to the cclre os mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imclgiriatlori than his iudgment. He had, hence, that hlgh romantic feeling of h0nour and candaur, which dai1y ruins so many milllriers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque esfeet of the scene, af wo see in romances: he thought thal the inisery of a oottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, hut which were 6etter adclptod to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the drcams af poets were the realities of llfe. Ho was handsome, frank, ond rich: for these reasons, upon his enlering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, slriving whlch should describe with least truth their lclriguishing or ramping favourltes: the davghters at the same ti me, 6y their brighteriing countenances when he approached, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his \u017folitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles tbat flickerod, nol from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snufsing, there was ria foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from wbich he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compenfation iri his gratified vanity, he was about to reIinquish his dreams, wheri tbe extraordinary being we have abaue deseribed, crossed bim in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho vory impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, who gave few 0ther sig n\u017f of his observation of external objects, thari lhe tacit assent t0 their exi\u017ftence, imp1ied by the avoidance of their oontact: allowirig hjs imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soori formedthis objecl into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the perfon before him. He became acquainted wlth hlm, paid him attentions, and so far advanoed upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's asfairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from lhc notes of prcparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to lrovel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this slngular cbaracter, who, till now, had only whetted bis curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations haf heen thought necessclry t0 enoble the young to take some rapid \u017fteps jn the caroer of vice towards putting themselvef upon an equallty with the aged, and not aIlowing them to appear as if folleri from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleafantry or of praise, occording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. Thoy consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to jojn him. Flattered bysuch a mark of estecm from him, who, apparently, had notbing in common with otbcr men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waters.\nHilherto, Avbrey had had no opportunity of studying Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions wereexposed to bis view, the results ossered different coriclusions from thc apparent motives lo his conduct. His compariion was profuse in his libercllity;\u2014the idle, lhe vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hclnd morc than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avold remarking, that it was nat upon the vlrtuous, roduced to indigence by tbe misfortunes attendanl even up0n virtue, that ho bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardlysuppressed sneers; but when the profligale camo to afk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. This was, howevor, altributed by him to the greater imporlunity of thc vicious, which generally prevoils ovcr the retiring bashfulnes\u017f of the virtuous ind igenl. There waf one circumstance abovt the chari ty of his Lordship, whioh was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wbom il was bestowed, inevitably found that there wasa curfe upon it, for they wereall either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and tbe mo\u017ft abject misery. At Brusfels arid other towns thr0ugh which lhey passed, Auhrey was surprjzed attho apparent oagerness with whjch his companion sought for the centres ofall fashionable vioe; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharpcr was his antagonist, and then he last even more than he gained; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watchod the society around: it was not, however, fo when he encountered tbe rash youthful novioc, or the luckless father of a numer0us family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparerit abstractednefs af mind was laid clslde, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of tho cal whilst dallylng witb the balf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude af a dungean, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of tbis fiend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst the speakirig looks of mvte hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewjth to buy even suffloient t0 satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money srom lhe gambling tablc; but immcdiately lost, to the ruiner 0f many, the last gil der he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mig ht but be the result of a certain degree os knowIedge, which was nol, however, capable of combating the cunnirig os the more experjenced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure whioh proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity as speoking frankly and openly to him; however, this never ocourred. Lord Rutbven in hif carrioge, and amidst the varjous wild ond rich scenes of nature, was always the same: hiseye spoke loss than his lip; and though Aubrey was riear the object of bis curlosity, he obtained no greoter gratjfication from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break that my\u017ftery, whlch to his exalted imaginatiori b egan lo assvme the appearance of something supematvral.\nThey soon arriued at Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendanee upon lhe morning circle of an Italian countoss, whilst he went in search of the inemorials of ariother almost deserted city. Whilst he was lhus engaged, letters orrived frorn England, which he opened with eager impatience; the fjrst was from his sister, breathing nothing hut affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aslonished him; if it had besore entered into his lmagination that there was an evil power resident in his compani0n, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted up0n his immediately 1eaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adullress had not originated in hatred of hor charact er; but tbat he had re quired, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of bis guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsulIied virtve, down to the lowest abyssos infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femcl les wh0m he had sought, apparenlly on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and bad not scrupled to expose the whole defo rmity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose oharacter had not yet shown a single brig ht point on which to rest the eye. He resalued to invent some plausible pretext for a6andoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him mare closely, and to let no slight circumstance\u017f pass by unnoticed. Heentered into the same circlo, and soon perceived, that his Lordship waf erideovouring to work upon the inexperience of the davghter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequerited. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmclrried female is met with in society; he was therofore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignatjon had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of on jnnocenl, though thougbtless girl. Losjng no time, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptlyasked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his bejng about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered, that hjs intentions were such a\u017f he svpp0sed all would haue upon suoh an occasion; and upan being pressed whetber he intended to marry her, m erely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immedialely writing a note, to say, that srom that moment be must decline accornpanying his Lordfhip in lhe remalnder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and callirig vpon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughlor, but also concerning the character of his Lord\u017fhlp. The ofsignatian was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely senl his servanl to notify his camplete assent to a separation; but did nol hint any suspicion af his p1 an\u017f having beeri foiled by Aubrey's interpasitian.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stcps towards Greece, and crossing the Penirisula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence jn thc house of a Greek; and soon occupied biinself in tracing the faded rcc0rds of ancient glory upori monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chroniclirig the de eds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roos as himself, existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed thc model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hopo of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, savo thclt her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plairi, or tripped along tbe movntain's side, one would have thought thc gazelle a poor type of her bcauties; for who would have exchariged her oye, apparently the eye of onimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariimal suited but lo the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncan\u017foious girl, engaged in the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind,to the eager gaze of him, wha forgot the letlers he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-1ike figure. Ofton would her tresses falling, as she flitted araund, exhibjt in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulnesf of the anliquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretatiori of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt why atleinpt to describe charms which al1 feel, but rione can appreciato?\u2014It wa\u017f innocence, youth, ond becluty, unaffccted by crowdeddrawing-rooins and stifling balls.Whilst hc drew those remains of which he wlshed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effeots of hjs penoil, in tracing the sccnes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circIjng dance upon the open plairi, wovld pairit, to him in all the glowing ealours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp \u017fhe rcmembered viewing in her lnfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made cl greoler impression upon her mind, would tellhim all the supernatural tales os her nurse. Her earneftness and apparent 6elief of what she riarrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upan the life of a love ly female to prolong his existenoe for the erisuing months, his blo od would run cold, whllst be attempted to laugh her out of such idle and borrible santasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old rnen, who had at last detected one living among lhemselves, after several of thoir ncar relatives and children bad been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hiin so ineredulous, she begged of him to believe her, far it had been, remarkod, that those who had daredto questlon their exifterice,always hcld somc pr0of given, which obliged them, witb grief and heartbreaking, to corifess it was true. She detaiIed to bim the traditiona1 appoarance of these monstcrs, and his horror waf increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persifted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same lime hc wondered at thc many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in lhe superriatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAubrey begcln to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted witb all the asfected virtues of the wornen am0ng whom he had sought for his vision0f romance, won bis heart; arid whiIe he ridicv1ed the idea of a young rnan of Eriglish habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost sairy form bef0re him. He wou ld tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to retu rn unlil his object was attained; but be always found it impossible to fix his atteriti0n upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retairied an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughls. Ianthe was unconscious of hjs love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemod to part from bim with reluctancc; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could vis it her favourite havnts,whilst her guardian was ocoupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which hod yct escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to herparents onthe subject of Vampyres, and they bolh, wlth seueral present, affirmed their existence, pa1e with horror at the very name. Soon a ster, Aubrey determiried to proceed upon one of his oxcursions, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they hcard the namc of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek w0uld ever re main, after the day had closed, upon any consideratlon. Thoy described it as tbe resort of lhe uompyres jri their nocturrial orgies, and dcnounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him wh0 dclred to cross their palh. Aubrey made light of their representotions, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set oss upon his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe tho melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to fjnd that his wards, mocklng tbe belief of those horrible fjends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about lo depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnesl1y beggod of him to returri, ere riight allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promjsed. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that be did not perceive that doy-lighl would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one af those specks which, in the warmer climcltes, so rapid1y gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their rclge upon the dovoted country.\u2014He ot last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by speed for his delay: but it wa\u017f too late. Twilight, in these southern climate\u017f, is almost unknown; immedlcltely the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders bad scarcely an iriterval of rest\u2014its tbick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foliage, whi1st the blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frjght, ond he was carried with dreadful rapidity tbrough the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fat-\niguc, stoppod, and he found, 6y lbe glare of lightning, that he was in the neighhourhood of a hovel that hardly liftcd itself up from the mafses of dead leaues and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he opproached, hop ing to find \u017fome one to guidc him tothe town, or at least trusling to obtainshelter from the pclting 0f lhe ftorm. As he approclched, the thunders, for a mo ment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, c ontinued in 0ne almost unbroken sovnd;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by tbe tbunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He fovnd himself iri utter darkness: the sourid, however, gujded him. He was apparently unpereeived; for, though he ealled, still the sourids continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himsolf in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and be feIt himself grappled by one wh0se strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his lise as dear1y as he could, be struggled; hut it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enorm0us force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himsclf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when lho glare of many torohes penetrating through tbe hole that gaue light jn the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leavlng his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the cra \u017fhing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. Tho storin was now slill; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard 6y those without. They entered; the light of their torches fe1l upon the mud walls, and the thatch laadod on evcry individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire os Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was ogain left in darkncss; bvt what was his horror, when the light of thc torches once in0re burst upon him, to percejve the airy f0rm of his fair conductrefs broughl in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wos bvt a vjsion arising from hjs disturbed imaginalion; but ho agairi saw the same form, whcn he unclosed them, stretched by hi\u017f side. There was no colovr upon her cheek, not even upon ber lip; yet lhore was a stillness about her faco thal seemed almost as attaching as tho life that once dweIt there:\u2014upon her rieck and breast was hlo0d, and upon her throatwere the rnarks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horrar, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A 1itter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sideof her wbo had lately been to him the obj ect of so many bright and fairy vislons, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts w ere\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held olmost vnconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a pa rticular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been ongclged in the search of her whom a mother hadmissed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached thc city, forewarned theparents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossib le; but wheri they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corfe. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrcy being put to 6ed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in thefe intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by someunaccountable combination he \u017feemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he wauld imprec ate ma1edictions upori his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanocd at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motivc, vpon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hjmseIf in the same h0use, and became his constant atlendant. When the lattcr recovered from his deljrium, hc was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had riow combined with that 0f o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance f0r tbe foult that bad caused their separati0n, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, soon reconoiled him to bis presence. His lordship seemcd quite changed; he no longer clppeared thclt apathetic being who hod so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no differerice from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gclze fixed intently upan him, with a smile of malicious exullationplaying upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smile haunted him. During the laft stage af lhe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly ongaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling bree2e, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, tbe movele\u017fs sun;\u2014indeed, he clppeared to wish to avoid thc eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have flod for ovor. He was now as much a lover of solitude and si1ence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, bis mind could nol find it in the neighb0urhood of Athens; jf he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he soughl it in the woods, her light step w0uld appear wandering amidst thc underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly lurning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale fclce and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile uponher lips. He determjned to fly scenes, every feature of wbjch created suchbitler asfociations iri his mind. He proposod to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsolf bound by the lerider care he had taken of him during his illness, that tbey should visit those parts ofGreeoe neither hod yet seen. They travelled in cvery direction, and fovght every spot t0 which a recollection could be attached: but tbough they thus hastened from place to place, yet they soemed not to heed whclt they gazed upon. They heard much of r0bbers, but they gradually began to sl ight thefe reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest jt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting lhe advice of tho inbabitants, on one occasion they lravelled withonly a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dosenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whioh was the bed of a torrent, with lclrge masses os rock brought down from the noighbo-\nuring preciplees, they bad rea\u017fon to repenl their negligence; for scarcely wero the whole of the party engaged in the narr0w pass, when they were stortled by the whistling of bullets cIose to their heads, and by the eehoed report of several guns. In an instant thejr guards had left tbem, and, placing themselves hehind rocks, had begun to fire jn the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turri of thc defile: bvt ashamed of being thus detalned by a foe, who wjth insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposedto unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb ab0ve and take them in tbe rear, they determined at onoe to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven reccived a \u017fhot in the shoulder, which 6rought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedirig the c0ntest or his own peril, was s0on surprised by seeing tbe robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and svrrendered.\nBy promjses of great reward, Aubrey soon induced tbem toconvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring ca6in; and having agreed upon a ransom, hc was no more distvrbed by tbejr presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrclde should return with the promised sum, for which he had cln order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days morliflcati0n ensuod, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconseious of pain as he bad beeri of the objects about him: but towards the clase oftbe laft evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofton fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earneflness\u2014\"Assist me! y0u may save me\u2014you may do more thari that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed thc death ofmy existerice as littIe as tbat of the passing day; but yav may save my hanour, your friend's hon0ur.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my lise ebbs apace\u2014I cannot oxplain the whole\u2014but if you would concool all yov know af me, my honour were free from \u017flain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but lifo.\"\u2014\"It shall not bo known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wjth exultant vio-\nIcnce, \"Swear by all your saul reueres, by all your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and aday you will not impart your kn0wledge of my crimes or death to any living boing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from lheir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laugbing upon his pillow,and brcathod rio more.\nAubroy retired ta rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintancc with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivorlng came ovcr him, as if from the presontiment of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising early in tbe m0rning, hewas about to enter the hovel in which he had lest the corpse, when a robber methim, and infarmod him thal it was na langer there, having been conveyed by himsolf and cainrades, upon his retiring, to lhe pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his deoth. Aubrey astonished, and tclking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upan the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he f0und no trace of eithcr the corpse or the clothes, thougb the robb ers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they hadlaid the body. For a time his mind wasbewildered in conjectures, but he at last retvrned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the soke of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with \u017fuch terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparontly conspired to heightcn lhat superstitious melanch0ly thal had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst olher thi ngs there was a case coritaining several weclpons of offerice, more or less adaptedto ensure tbe death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning thcm over, arid examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samo style a\u017f the dagger discovered in the falal hut\u2014he shuddcred\u2014hasteriing to gainfurther proof, be found lhe weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when be difcovered that it fitted, though peculiar1y shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed t0 need no fvrther certainly\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room sor doubt; thore wcre also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on hi\u017f way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduclivc arts. Her parents werc iri distress,their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard 0f since the departure of his lord\u017fhip. Aubroy's mind beoamo almost broken under so many repealed horrors; he was afraid that lhis lady bad fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhc. He became morofe and silent; and his only occupation c0nslsted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were golng to savo the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wi11, \u017foon wafted hiin to the English shores; and be hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and thcre, for a moinent, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, a1l memory of tho past. If she before, by her infantine carosses, had gained his affectjon, now that the woman begon to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had not tbat wln nlng grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There wcls noneof that light brillioncy which only existf in the healed atmospberc of a crowded aparlment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the leuity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which djd not seem to arise fram misfortune, but from some feeljng wilbin, that appeared to indicate a s0ul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays whero'er a butterflyor a co1ovr mcly atlract\u2014it was sedateand pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brightened 6y the smile of j0y; bul when her brother breathed to her hls afsection, and wauld in her pre-\nsence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchangcd her smile for lhat of the voluptuary? It scemed as if those eyes,\u2014lhat sace were then playing in the light of their own nativo sphere.She was yet only eighte-\nen, and had not been presented ta the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should bo delayed until her brother's retum from lhe continent, wben hc might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved thattbo next drawing-room, which was fast approoching, should be the epoch of her entry into lhe \"bvsy fcene.\" Aubrey would rather have remai ned in lhe manslon of bis fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not foel interest ab0ut the srivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the evenls he had witnes\u017fed; but he determined to sacrificc his 0wn oomfort lo the proteetion af his sister. They soon clrrived in t0wn, and preparod for tho next day, which had been clnnounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and aIl who were anxi-\nou\u017f to bask inthe smile of royalty, hastencd tbither. Aubrey was there with his sistcr. Whi1e he was stonding in a oorner by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly selzed by the arm, and a voice ho recognizcd too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to tum, feclrful of seeing a spectre that would 6last bim, when he peroeived, at a little distance,lhe same figure which had clttraeted his notice on this spot upon his first entry lnto saciety. He gazed till hi\u017f limbs alm0st refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take thearm of a friend, and forcing a pas\u017fage through the crowd, be threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hand\u017f upori his head, as if he were af raid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthvon again before him\u2014oircumstarices started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imaginatian hod oonjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determined, thereforo, to go again int0 society; sor though ho attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he oould not succeed in gaining information. He went a sew nights after with his si\u017fter to the as\u017fembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired inlo a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and eritering ariother room, faund his sister surrounded by several, apparenlly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he rcquested lo move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He fprang forword, soized his sistcr's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towards the s treet: at the door he found himself impoded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voiee whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reachcd home.\nAubrey became almast distracted. If 6efore his mind had been absorbed by one svbject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now lhat the certainty of the monster's livjng again pressed upon his thovghtf. His sistcr's attentions were now unheeded, and il wa\u017f in vain that she intreatod him to explain to her what hod caused his abrupt conduct. He only vttered a few words, and thosc terrified her. The more he thought, the more be was bewildered. His oath stortled him;\u2014waf he then to ollow this monstcr to roam, bearing rvin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions,who would 6elieve him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he reinembered, had been already m0cked. For day\u017f he remairied in this \u017ftate; shvt up in hi\u017f room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister come, wbo, with eyef streaming with tears, besought him, f0r her sake, to support riature. At last, no longer oapahle of bearing stillnessand solitude, be lest his houfe, roamcd from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected,and he wa ndered, as often exposed t0 the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no 1onger to be recogriized; at first hc returned with the evening to the house; but at la\u017fl be laid him down to rest whereuer fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxjous for his safety, employed people t0 follow him; but tbey were saon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, h0wever, suddenly ehanged. Struck with tbe idea that he left by his absence the wholc of his frierids, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se presence thoy were unconscious, he determined to enler again into society, and watch him closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered int0 a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were s0 striking, hif iriward shudderings so visible, thathis sjster wos at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for ber sake, cl society which affectcdhim so strongly. When, bowever, rem0nstrance proved uriavailing, lhe guardiansthought proper to interpose, and, feoring lhat his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high tirne to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upan lhem by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to re\u017fide in the housc, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by ono terrible subject. His incoherence became clt last so great, thot he was confined to his chamher. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a gIassy lvstre;\u2014the only sjgn of affection and recollection remaining displayed it\u017felf upon tho entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, ond, seizing her hands, with l ooks that severcly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh,do not touch bim\u2014if your I0vc for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, howover, she inquired l0 whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and agaln be sank jnta a state, whence not even sbe could rou\u017fe him. This lclsted many months: gradually, howevcr, as the year was passing, his incoherences became loss frequent, and hif mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that severa1 times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smilc.\nThe time had noarly elapsed, when, upon the last dayof the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began ta converse with his physiciari upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's bcing in so awful cl siluation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instanlly Aubrey's attentlon was attracted; he asked anxiovsly to whom. Glad of this mark 0f reluming jritollect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking tbis wos a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleafed, and astonished thom still moreby his expressing his intenlion to be present at the nuptials, and dcsiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes hls sister was with him. Hc was apparently again capable os being affected by the irifluonce 0f her lovely fmile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the lhaught of ber brotber's being onco moro alive to the feeIings of affcctjon. He began to speak wilb all his w0nted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; operiing it, what was his surprise at beholding the features os the monstor who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait lna poroxysm af ragc, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her askirig him why he thus dostroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing hcr hands, arid gazing on her witb a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her \u017fwear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not cldvance\u2014jt seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthveri was near bim butsaw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard tbe whole, and thought this was but a roturn of his disorder, entered, and f0rcing him from Miss Au6rey, defired her to leave him. He fell upori his knees lo them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, clttributing this to the in sanity they imagined had taken possession os his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvcri had calIed the morning after the drawing-room, and had 6een refused with euery one else. When he hoard of Aubrey's ill hea1th, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned thot he was deemed irisane, his exultatjon and pleasure could bardly be concealed from those am0rig wh0m he had gained this information. He hclstened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attcndance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradualIywon lhe ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resi\u017ft his powcr? Hjs tangue had dangers and toils t0 recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy wlth any being ori lhe crowded earth, save with her to whom headdressed him\u017felf;\u2014could tell how, since he knew hcr, his existerice, had begun to seem worlhy of preservation, if it were mcrcly that he might listen to her foothing accents;\u2014in sine, he knew fo well how to use theserpent's art, or such wcls the will of fate, that he gained her asfections. The title of tho elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important einbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in splte of her brother's deranged state,) which wa\u017f lo take p1ace the very day hefore his doparture for lhe continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physieian and his guardians, attempted t0 bribe the servants, 6ut in vain. He asked for pen arid paper; it was gjven him; he wr ote a lelter to his sister, oonjuring her, as sbe valued her own happinesf, ber own hon0ur, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as tbeir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deljvor it; but giving it to the physici an, he th0ught it better nol to harass any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he corisidered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on witbout rost to the bu\u017fy inmates of the h0use; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notos of busy preparation. Morriing came, and the sound of carrjages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servarit\u017fat last overcame th eir vigilance, they gradually stole clway, leoving him in the cuftody of an belpless old wornan. He seized the opporturiity, with one bourid waf out of the room, and in a moment found hjinself in the apartment where a1l were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the fjrst to perceive him: hc imrnediately opproached, and, taking his arm by forco, hurriod him from the room, speechless witb rage. Whon on the stair case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remembor your 0ath, arid know, if nat my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So \u017faying, he pushed hjm towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in searcb ofhim. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not fin ding vont, had broken a blood-uessel, ond he was convcyed to hed. This was n0t mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he eritered, os the pbysician was afraid of agitclting her. The marriage was salemnjzed, and the bride and bridogroom lefl London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood pr0duced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guclrdians might beoalled, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related camposedly what theroclder has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it waf too late. Lord Ruthven hod djsappeared, and Aubrey's sisler had glvtted the thlrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE,&c.\n\"The world wcls aIl 6efore bim, where to choose his placc of rest, arid Providence hjs guide.\"\nIN Sailjng throvgh the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vesself, in the year 1812, we put irito the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certairi supply of cattle and vegelables always to be bad lhero, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and rnerchontmen; and th0ugb it lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation os a voyage. We laridcd; as usual, at tho bottom of tbe bay, and wbilst the men were emp1oyed in watering, and the purser bargaining for catt1o with thenatives, thc clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been befare. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticulc so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our gulde, who told u\u017f he had come from Scio with an Engli\u017fh lord, who left the i\u017fland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho ongagcd me as a pilot,\" soid the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choosc to quit Mitylene, where I arn likely to get married. He was an odd, hut a very good man. Tbe cottage ovcr tbe hill, facing the river, belongs to hiin, and he has lest an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there a6out fourteen months, though not con\u017ftantly; for he sailf in his felucca very often to the different islclnds.\"\nThi\u017f accaunt excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kjndly receiued by an old man, wh0 conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four aparlments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawirig-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spaciaus closet annoxed. They were all simply decorated: plain greeri-stained walls, marble tables 0n either side,a large myrtle jn the centre, and a small fountain beneoth, whicb could be made to play thr0ugh the branches by moulng a spririg fjxed in the side os a srnall bron2e Verivs iri a leanirig p0sture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dazen English carie chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were no mirrors, nor a singlepainting. The bedchomber had merely a large mattress spread on the floar, with two stuffed cotton quilts and o pillow\u2014the commori hed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed cl rnarble recess, formerly, theald man told us, filled with b0oks and papers, which were tben in a large feaman's chest in tbe claset: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exclmining the eontents. On the tabIet of the reeess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau's warks compIete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in tbe German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobue's n0vels; Schiller's play of the Rabbers;Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in I81o; several small pamphlets from tho Greek prefs at Constantinople, much torn, but no Englifb book of any description. Mosl of tbese books wero filled with marginal notes, wrjtten with a pencil, inItalian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, arid marked with sllps of papor, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been readirig these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otherf; but,\" said he, \"lhere they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withoul orders, ho would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwayf very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of thls farm for the trouble of tclking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottagc in the waod, clnd whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; Idon't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the hovse externally wos pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen braad, ond the fluted m arble pillars wilh black plinths and fret-work corriices, (as it is now custamary in Grecian architecture,) were considerabIy higher than tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was couered by a fine Tvrkey carpel, benealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the hou\u017fe-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings iri sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjo ying lhc evening breeze.\nOn the lest hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapcs, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the sha de os two large m yrtle bushes, a marhle seat wilh an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whlch we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said lhe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twlce a week, besides Sundays.\"\nTho vicw from this seat was whal may bo termed \"a bird's-eyo view.\"A linc of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with ollve and myrtle trees in bloorn, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple app eared in mcljestio deeay. A small stream issving from the ruins descended in broken cascadcf, untll it was lost in the woods near thc mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a l jttlc on the 1oft, lhrough a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several fmallis1ands were distinctly observed, stvddirig the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominlok, his banker, whohad gone toCandia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conduotor, \"could tcll, but I am furc he will not,\"\u2014\"And carinot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said hc, \"I dare nol.\" We hod not tiine to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnl several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioncd eight young girls when he was last upan tbe island, and even danced with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotlon and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bougbt a new hoat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamen ts to the poor chiIdren. In short, he appe-\nared to us, from all we callected, to have been a very eccentric and benevoIent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our 0ld friend at the cottage tbought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughtor, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-sorte, and taught hcr himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from thepeaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginalions all on the rack, gucssing who thjs rambler in Groece could be. He had money it was evident: he had phi1anthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, aIl our doubt\u017f were dispelled. Falling in company witb Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sald he, \"about wham you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited hlm at Milylene.\" We bad riever thcri heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calclcl in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with lhe idea of retvrning to Milylone on same future day; bul to me thclt day will never return. I make this statemerit, believing it not quite unintere\u017fting, and in ju\u017ftice to bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as 0f an unfeeling dispo\u017fiti0n, averse toassoeiating with human nature, or contributing inany way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is djreotly the reverse, as may bo plairily gathered from those little anecdotes. All tbe finer feelirigs of the heart, so elegant ly dopicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seot in his bosom. Tenderness, sym-\npathy,and charity appear to guide oll his actions: and hjs courting tbe repose of s0litude is an addjtional reason for marking him as o being 0n whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thepreceding pleasjng \"traits\" withovt fceling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or p1eclsures, I do not assume a right to give on opinion. Reports are ever to be received with coution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsclf before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, ond shvn the world's applaufe, is the svrest testimony of a virluous heart and sclf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","3":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wjlliam Polidori\nTHE superstilion upon which this tale is founded is very general ln the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it djd not, however, extenditself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the diuision of thc Latin and Greek ehurches; al which time, the ldea becoining prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried ln their terrilory, it gradually increased, and formed the subjeet of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rislng from their graues, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. Inthe West it spread, with someslight variation, a1l over Hungary, Polclnd, Austria, and Lorraine, where the be1ief existed, thal vampyres riightly imbibed o certain portion of the blood of their victiins, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suokers fatten-\ned\u2014and their veins became distended to such o state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March,1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credi6lo account of a particular case of vampyrism, whioh is stated to have accurred at Madreyga, in Hungory. It appears, that upon an examinalion af tbe commclnder-in-chief arid magistrates os the place, they positivoly and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certajn Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had beon he clrd to say, that, at Cassouia, onthe frontiors of lhe Turkish Servia, he had been t0rmented by a vampyre, but hadfound a way to rid himself of the evil, by ealing some of the earth out of the vclmpyre's grave, and ru6bing himself with his blood. This precclution, however, did not prevent him from becomirig a vompyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death arid burial, many persons complained of having beeri lormented by hirn, and a depofition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attaeks. To prevent further mi\u017fchief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, t0ok up the body, and found it (as is supposed to bo usuol in cases 0f vampyrism) fresb, arid entirely free from corruption, and cmitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and slorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, lhcy resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven onlirely lbrough the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have crjed out as dreadfully as if ho had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashes int0 his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corse\u017f of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, iri their turn, become agents upon others who survlved lhem.\nThe universaI belief ls, that a person sucked by a vampyre bccomes a vampyre hjmself, and sucks in his turn.\nCbief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it \u017feems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observalions than any other instance which could be adduced. Iri mclny part\u017f as Greece il is considered as a \u017fart os punjshmerit after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, thclt the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine bis infernal visitations solely to those beirigs he loved most whiIe upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on oarth, as Vampyresent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rerit; Tben ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the 6lood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At mldnight drain thc stream os life; Yet loathe tbe banquet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere thcy yet expire, Shall know tho demon for their slre; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The y0ungest, best bcloved os all, Shall bless thee with a sather's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart ln flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's lasl tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy gIancc must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand fhall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of whicb, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borncaway by thee Memorial os thine agony! Yetwith lhine own best bl0od shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then \u017ftalking to thy svllen grove, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutboy has also introduced in his wild but beautlful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre c0rse of the Arabian rnaid Oneiza, who is represeritedas hauing returned from the grave for the purposo of tormenling him she best loved whlIst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted frorn the sinfvlness of her life, she h cing pourtrayed throughout tbe wholo of the tale af o complete type os purity and innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whjch he pretends to have beeri an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upan this subject, besjdes a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustratiue of its effeets, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a claf\u017fical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curiou\u017f arid interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the presont may suffice sor the liinits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and whicb may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is lhe one in most general acceptatian, there are several others fynonymous with it, made use af in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of tho dissipations attendant upon a London winter, thore appeared at the various parlles of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkablo for his singularilies, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not partioipale therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fajr only attracted his attention, that he might by cl look quell lt, and throw fear irito those breasls w here thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensatjon of awe, could nat explain whence it arose: somc attributed it to the dead grcy eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glancc to pjerce throvgh lo the inw ard workings of the heart; but fell upori the chcek with a loaden ray that weighed upon tho skin it c0uld not pass. His peculiaritios caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, arid thosewho hod been occustomed t0 vioIeril excitement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in lheir presence copable of engaging their attention. In spite af the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, ej lher from the blush os modesty, or from tbe strong emoliori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc female hunlers after notoriety attempted to win hjs attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of wbat they might term affection: Lcldy Mercer, who had been the mockery of every in0nster shewn in draw ing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and dld all but put on the dres\u017f of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014tbough in vclin:\u2014when she stood before him, thoughhis eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, stiIl it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was bofflod, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not lhat tbe female sex was indlfferent to him: yet such waf the appa rent cautlon with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever address ed himself t0 females. He had, howover, the reputation of cl winning torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparenl hatred of vice, he was as often among tho\u017fe females who farm the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those wbo sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon a young gcntlemclri of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left wilh an only sister in thepassession of great we alth, hy parents who died whilehe was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thaught it their duty merely to take care of his sortune, while tbey reljnquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mcrcenary svbalterns, he cultivatedmore his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic foeling of honour ond candour, which daily ruins so many miIliners' apprentices. He believ ed all to sympathife with virtue, and tbought that vlce was lhrown iri by Providence meroly sor the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery af a cottage mcrely c0nsisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, bvt which were bctter adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variou\u017f co1ourcd patches. He th0ught, in fine, tbclt the dreams of poets were the realities os lise. He was handsome, frank, ond rich: f0r these reasons, upon his entering into the gay eircles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whicb should describe with least truth thcir languishing ar romping favourites:the daughters at the same time, by their brightening c0untenances when he approached, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, when he opened his llps, soon led himinto falso nolions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to tbc romance of hif solitary hours, he was starlled clt fjnding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot sram the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of plea\u017fing pictvres and descriptians contained in those volumes, from which hehad formed his study. Finding, however, somc compcnsotiori in hi\u017f gratified vonlty, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossod him iri his career.\nHe walched him; and the vory impossibilily of forming an idea of the character os a man entirely absorbed in himsolf, who gave few other figns of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent tothoir existence, implied by the avoidanee of their contact: allowing hif imagiriation to pict ure every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soan formed this object intothe hero of a romanee, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rathcr than the persan before him. He became aequainted with him, paid him attentions, and fo far advancod upon his noticc, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs wereembarra\u017fsed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparatjon in \u2014 Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only wbetted hi\u017f cvriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for hjm to perforin the tour, whjch for many gcnerations has been thought necessary to enable lhe young to take some rapid stops in the carecr os vice towards putting themselve\u017f upon an eqvality with lhe aged, and not allowing lhem to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scclndalous intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, aceording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately menli0ning his iritentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive froin him a propo sal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of osteem from hlm, who, apparently, had nothjng in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of sludying Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he fourid, that, though many more of his aetlons were exposed to his view, thc results affered differcnt conclvsions from the apparenl motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his li6erality;\u2014tho idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his band more than en0ugh to relieve their immedlate wants. But Aubrey covld not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the daor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, 0r ta sink him still deeper in his lniqvity, he was sent away with rich charily. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous lndigent. There was 0ne circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which wasstill inore impressod upon his mind: alI those upon whom it was bcstowed, inevltably sound that there was o cursc upon jl, for they were oll either led to tbescaffold, or sunk to the lowest clnd the most abject misery. At Brussels and otber lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparont cagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashi0nable vice; there he entered into al1 the spirit os the faro table: he betted, clnd always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he l0st even more than he gained; bvt it was always with tbe same unchanging face, wilb whicb he generally watched the society arovnd: it waf not, however, sa when he encountered the rash youthfvl novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; lhen his very wish \u017feemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent a6stractedness of mind was laid aside, arid his eyes sparkled with more fire thcln that of the cat whi lst dallying wlth the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn srom thecircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fierid; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst tho speaking looks of mute hungry children, wjthout a \u017fingle farthing 0f his late immense wealth, wherewith to huy even sufficient ta satisfy their present cravirig. Yet he took no money from the gclinbling table; but immediately lost, to tbe rui ner of many, the last gi1der he had just sriatched from the canvulsive grasp of the innoeerit: this migbt but be the result of o certain degrec of knowledge, which was n0t, however, capable of eombating the curining of themore experienced. Aubrey often wisbed to represent this to his friend, and beg him to rofign that charlty and pleasvre which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend lo his own prosjt;\u2014but he delayedit\u2014for eclch day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the vari0us wild and rich scenes af nature, was alwclys the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and tbough Au hroy was near the object of his curlosity, he obtained no greater grati fication from it than the constant excitemont of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted irnagination began to assume tbe appcarance of something supernatural.\nThey so0n arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lostsight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the mor ning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of lhe memorials of another almostdesorted city. Whjlst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, whlcb he opened with e ager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathjng nothing bvt affection; the otherf were from his guclrdians, the latler astoriished bim; if it had before entered into bis imagination lhal tbere wclsan evil power resident iri hi\u017f companion, these seemcd to giue him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, thathis character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his llcentious habits moro dangerous to sociely. It had been discovered, that his contempt for lhe adultress had not originclted ln hatred of her characler; but that he had reqvired, lo enhance hif gratification, thot his victim, the partner of his gvilt, should be hurled fromtbe plnnacle of vnsu1lied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degrodation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on aecount of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even thc mask aside, and had nol scrupled to oxposo the who1e deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upan leaving one, w hose character had not yet shown a single brlght point 0n which lo rest lhe eye. He resalved to invent \u017fome plausible prolext for abandonjng hjin a1together, purp0sing, in the mean while, to watob him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoliced. He cntered into thc same circ1e, and s0on percejved, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upan the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequcnted. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimorried femalo is mel with in society; be was therofore obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all hjs windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin ofan innocent, though thoughtIess girl. Losing no time,he eritered thc apclrtment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked him his intentions wlth respect to the Iady, informing him at the same lime that he wa\u017f aware of his being about to meet her that very riight. Lord Ruthven answered, that hls intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pr essed whether he inlended to marry ber, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writ-\ning a note, to say, that from tbat moment be must decline occompanying his Lords hip iri the remainder of their praposed tour, he ordered his seruarit to soek other apartments, and calling upon the motherof the lady, informed bor of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughler, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation wof prevcnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans baving been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dlrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Pcninsula, soon fovnd himsclf at Athens. He theri fixcd his residence in the houso of a Greek; and soon 0ccupied himself in tracing the faded records of anciont gl0ry upon monuments that clpparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only bcfore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many ooloured lichen. Under the some roof as himself, existeda 6eing, so beautifuI and delicate, that she rnight bave formed thc model for a painter wishing to pourlray on carivass the promised hope of the failhful in Mabomet'f paradise, save thal her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong t0 those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the inountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type 0f her beauties; for who would have exchan-\nged her eye, clpparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animalsuited but to tbc taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquiljes, and 0ften would the uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursvit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagergaze of him, who forgot the letterf he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tab let, in tho contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often w0uld her tresses falling, as she flitted arovnd, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicalely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excufc the forgetfulne\u017fs of tbe antiquary, who let escape from hjs mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passoge in Pausariias. But why altempt to describe charms which all feel, bvt none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawirig-rooms and \u017ftifljng ball\u017f. Whilst he drew those remairis of which he wisbed to preserve a memorial for his future hovrs, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then descrjbe to him the circling danceupon lhe open plain, would paint, to hjm in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, thc marriage pornp she rememberedvicwing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects tbat hod evidently made a greater impres\u017fion up0n her mind, would tell bim all the supcrnatural tales of her nurse. Her eamestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as \u017fhe told him lhc tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearesl ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely feinale to prolong his existence for lho ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attemptod to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe clted to him the names of old men, who had at last delectcd one living among themselvos, after several 0f their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wheri she found him so inerodulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, rernarked, that those who had dared lo question thcir existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She delailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hcaring a pretty accvrate description os Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, thal there could be no truth in ber fears, though at the same time he wondered clt the many coincidences which had all lended to excitea belief in the supernotvral powor 0s Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to clttach himseIf more ondmore to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtuesof the women amorig whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wori his heclrt; and while he ridjculed the idea of a young man of English ha6ils, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to lhe almost fairy form before bim. He would tear him\u017felf at tjmes from her, and, forming cl plan sor some aritiquarian research, be would depart,determined not to return until his object was altained; 6ut he always found it imposslb1e to fix his attention upon theruins around him, whilst in his mind hc retained an image lhat soemed a1one the rightfvl possessor os his thoughts. Ianthe wos uriconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluetance; but it was because she had no longer ony one with wbom shc could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelcbing or uncavering somo fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealcd to her parent\u017f on the subject of Vampyros, arid they both, with several present, affirmed thejr existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard lhe name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass thro ugha wood, where no Greok would ever remain, after the day had closed, upori any c0nsideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their noeturnal orgies, and denounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey madc ljght of their representations, and tried to laugh thcin out of the ldea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal p0wer, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wa\u017f silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set aff upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to obsorve the melancholy foce of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, macking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them wilh such terror. Wben he was aboul to dopclrl, Iarithe came to the side of hls horse, and earnostly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in clction;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupjed in his re\u017fearch, that he dld not perceive that day-light would soon cnd, and that in tho horizon there was one of thosc spccks which, iri the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour alltheir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these \u017foulhern climates, i\u017f almost unknown; immediatelythe sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he had advanccd far, the power of the storm waf abovc\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy raln forced ils wcly through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forkod lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Svddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was in thc neighbourhood of a hovel thclt hardly lifted itseIf up from the masses of dead leoves and brushwood which surrounded it. Di\u017fmountirig, he approached, hoping to firid some one to gujde him to the town, or at lea\u017ft trusting to obtairi shclter from tbe pelting of the slorm. As he approached, tbe thunders, sor o momerit silent, allowed hlm to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was \u017ftar tled: but, roused by the thunder which again ralled over his heod, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door os the hut. He found him\u017felf in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was clpparently unperoeived; sor, though he called, still the sounds continued, ond no notice was tclken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whlch a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose \u017ftrength seemed superhuinari: determined to sell hls life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against tbe ground:\u2014bis enemy lhrew himself upon him, and kneeling up0n his breast, had placed his hands vpon bis thraat\u2014when the glclre of many lorches penetrating through the hole lhat gclve light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rosc, and, leavlng his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the brancbes, as he broko through the wood, was rio longer beard. The storm was riow stilI; arid Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch looded on every iridiuidual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attraoted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when tho light of thc torches once more burst upon him, to peroeive the airy forrn of his fair eonductress brought in o llfeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping tbat it was 6ut a vision arising from his dislurbed imagiriation; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was na colour upori her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet therewas a stillness about her facc that seemed almost as attaohing as lhe life that onoe dwclt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her thraat were lhe marks of teeth having opened the vcin:\u2014to this the men painted, crying, simultaneously slruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lltter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was loid by the side of her who had lalely been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the flawer of life that had died within her. He knew not what hls thougbts were\u2014his mindwas benumbed and seemed to \u017fhun reflection, and take rcfuge in vacanoy\u2014he beld almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, wbich had becn found in the hut. They were soon mot by dissoront parties who hod been engaged in the se arch of her whom a mother bad missed. Their lamentable crief, as lhey approached the city, forewarned tbe paronts of s0me dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grjef would be impo\u017fsible; but when they ascertained the cause of thcir child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inc0nsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being pul to bod was seized with a most violent fever, and was o ften delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthuen and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unac countable combjnation he seemed to beg of his former coinpanion to spare the being he loved. At other timcs he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, chanced at this time to arrive at Athen\u017f, and, from whatever matiue, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hiinsels in the same hause, and became his constant ottendari t. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he wa\u017f horrified and startled at the sight of him whose imoge he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kirid words, implying cllmost repentancefor the foult that had caused their separation, and slill rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to hlf presence. His lord\u017fhip seemed quite changed; he no loriger appeared that apathetic being who had so astoriished Aubrey; but as soori as bis c0nvalescence began to be rapid, he againgraduolly retired into the sclme state of mind, ond Aubreyperceived no difference from the former man, except tbat at times he was surprised lo meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his 1ips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hiin. Dvring the last stage os lhe inualid's rocovery, LordRuthveri was apparently engaged in watching lbo tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking thc progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless sun;\u2014irideed, hc appeared to wish to avoid the eyes os all.\nAubrey's inind, by this shock, was much weakened, ond tbat elasticity of spirit wbich had once sa distinguished him now seemed to have f1ed for ever. He was now as much cl lover of folitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it jn the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidft the rujns he had formerly frequenled, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014jf he s0ught it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst lhe underwoad, in quest of the modest violet; then sudderily turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a mcck smile upon her lips. He determined ta fly scenes, every featuro of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsolf bound by the tender care he had taken of him during bis ilIncss, that they shou1d vi\u017fit thoso parts of Greeee neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attachcd: bul though thcy thus ha\u017ftened fromplace to place, yet they seemed not t0 heed what thcy gazed upon. They heard muoh of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these re port\u017f, whlch they imaginedwere only the invention of indlvidual\u017f, wbose inlcrest it was to exeite the generosity of tho se whom they defended froin prelended dangers. In consequencc of thus neglectlng the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guardf, more ta servc as gvides thari as a defence. Upon enteririg, however, a narrow defile, at tho bottom os whicb was the hed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbovring precipices, they had reason to repenl their negligence;far fcarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were slortled by lhe whistling of buIlets close to thelr heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themsclves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthuon and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moinent behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but a\u017fharned of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade lhem advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the ra6bers should climb above and take them in the roar, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of therock, when Lord Ruthven recoived a shotin the shou1der, which broughl him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; arid, no longer heeding the contest or his own poril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbcrs' faces around him\u2014hif guards hauing, vpon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises os great reward, Aubrey foon induccd tbem to convey his wounded friend t0 a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their pre\u017ferice\u2014they being content merely to gvard the entrclnoe till their comrade should return wlth the promised sum, for which he had an arder. Lord Ruthven's strcngth rapidly decreased; in two days inortisication ensued, arid deatb feemed advancing wlth hasty steps. Hls oonduct and appearance had n0t changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets ab0ut him: but towards the close of the last everiing, his mind became apporontly uneasy, arid his eye aften fixed upon Aubrey, who was induoed to offer hjs assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Asslst me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than tha t\u2014I mean not my llfe, I beed tbe death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may sove my horiour, your friend'f honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I nced but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explaln the whole\u2014bul if you would conceal all y0u know of me, my honour were free from stain in tho world's mouth\u2014and if my d eatb were unknown for some time in Englarid\u2014I\u2014I\u2014butlife.\"\u2014\"It shall nol be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisirig himself withexultant uiolence, \"Swear by all your soul revcres, by all your nature fearf, swear that, fora year and a day you will not impart your knowledge af my crimes or death to any living bcing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatcver you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seomed burstlng from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he surik laughing upon his plllow, and brealhed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did nol sleep; lhe many circumstances attendlng his acqvaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew nat why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering cclme avor him, as if from thcpresentiinent of som ething horrlble awaitinghim. Rising early in tho morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which be had left the corpse, when cl robher met him, and iriformed hlm that it was no longer there, having beon conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to tbe pinnacle of a neighbouring mounl, according lo a pr0mife they had given his lordship, that it fhould be exposcd t0 the flrst cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, delermined to go and bvry it upon the spot wbere it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the eorpse or the clothes, though the robhers swore they pointed oul thc identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mlnd was bewildered in conjeelures, but he at last relurned, convinced thot they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a c0vntry in which he had met with svcb terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all clpparently conspired to heighten thal superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to corivey him to Otranto, or to Napl es, he occupied himself in arrangirig those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other thirigs there was a case containing severol weapons 0f 0ffence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers clnd otaghans. Wbilst turriing them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger difcovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further pr0of, he found the wcapon, and hif h0rror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarIy shaped, the shealb he hold in bis hand. His eyes seemed lo need no further certainty\u2014they \u017feemed gazing tobe bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to difbelieve; but the partioular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and shoath were alike ln splendour onboth, and left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hi\u017f way home, at Rome, his firsl inquiries wcre concerning the lady he had atlemptod to snalch from Lord Ruthuen'f soductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since lhe departure of his lord\u017fhip. Aubrey's mind beeame almast brokon under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady bad fallen a victim to thc destroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and bis only occupation consisted in urging tho speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, so0n wafted him to the English sh0res; and hc hasleried to the mansion of hi\u017f fathers,and there, for a moment, appoclred t0 lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory 0f the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she wos still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace whicb gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assomblie\u017f. There was none os that light bril1iancy which only exists in the heated atmo\u017fphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the Ievity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from soine feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul c0nscious of a 6righler realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her hi\u017f affeclion, and would in her presence forget those griess she knew destrayed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed a\u017f lf those eyes,\u2014thclt foce were then playirig in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to thc world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit thal her presentation should be delayed unti1 her br0thor's return from the continent, wben he might be her protector. It wasnow, therefore, resolued that the ncxt drawing-room, which was fast approachlng, should be the epoch af her entryinto the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rathcr have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivoIities osfashionable strangers, when his mind hod been \u017fo torn hy lhe events he had witnessed; but hedetermlned to sacrifice his own comfort to lhe protection of hi\u017f sister. They soon arrjved in town, and prepared for the next day, whjch had been announced as a drclwing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held sor a long time, and all wha were anxious to bask inthe fmilc of royalty, hastened thilher. Aubrey was there with his si\u017fter. While he was ftonding in a eorncr 6y himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the fjrst time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in lhat uery place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and cl voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hard1y courage to turn, fearfvl of seelng a \u017fpectre that would blasl hjin, when he perceived, at a litlle distance, the same figure which had attracted hjs notice on lhis spot upon his first entry into sociely. He gazed till his limbs almost resvsing to bear their weight, ho waf obliged to take the arm of cl sriend, and forcing a passclge through the erowd, he threw himself into hi\u017f carriage, and was drivon home. He paoed the room with hurricd steps, and fixed hls hands upon his head, as if he wore afraid his lhoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreodful array\u2014tho dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014Hc roused himself, he covld riot believe it pofsible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imaginali0n bad conjured up the image his mind wos resting upon. It was impossible lhat it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he atlempted to ask conoerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succoed in gaining informaljon. He went a few nightf aftcr with his fister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protectiori of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his 0wn devouring thoughls. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him those feature\u017f he moft abhorred. He sprclrig forward, seized hjs sister's arm, and, with hurried step, sorced her towards the street: al the door be found himself lm peded by the crowd of servanls who werewaiting for their lords;and whlle he was engaged in pafsing thcm, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Roinember yovr aath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sifter,soon reached home.\nAubrey became olmost dlstracted. If before his mind had been ahsorbed by one subject, how much inorc complelely was it eng-\nrossed, now tbat the certainty of the monster's Iiving agajn pressed upon bis thoughts. His sister's attentioris were now unheeded, clnd it was in vain tbat she intreated him to exp1ain to her what bad caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. Tbe more he thought, the more he was bewildored. His oath starlled him;\u2014was be then lo allow this monster to roam, boaring ruin upon his breath, amjdst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His vcry sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose hif suspicions, who would believe him? He tbought of employing his own hand to free theworld from fuch cl wretch; but death, he rememhered, had been alreody mocked. For days he remained in this state; sbut up in his ro0m, he saw no one, and clte only whon bi\u017f sister came, who, with eye\u017f streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, t0 support nature. At last, no longer capablo os bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from slreet to street, anxious to fly lhat image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often expafod to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned wlth lhe evening to the house; but at last helaid him down to restwherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, arixious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursucr fwifter than any\u2014from lhought. His conduel, however, sudderily ehanged. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his sriends, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se presence lhey were unconscious, he dotermined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all wh0m Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered inlo a raom, his ha ggard and suspicious looks were so striklrig, his inward shudderings sa visihle, thal his sister was at Iast obligcd to beg os him to abstairi from seeking, for her fake, a society which affected him \u017fo strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailirig, lhe guardians thought propcr to interpose, and, fearing that his mirid was becoming alienated, they lhought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufserings he had da ily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they oonsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constont care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so cornpletely was his mind abforbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so greal, that ho was consined t0 hls cbarnber. There he would often lic for dclys, incapa6le of being roused. He had bec0me emaciated, his eyes had attaincd a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affcction and recoIlection rcmaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sisler; then he wou1d sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflictod her, ho would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not t ouch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" clnd again he fank into a state, whenoe not even she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohe-\nrences became less frequerit, and his mind threw off a p0rtion of its gloom, whilst his guardians ahserved, that several tiines in the day he would courit upon his f ingers a definite number, and theri smile.\nThe tlme had nearly elapsed, when, upan the last day of the year, one of his guardians eritering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day t0 be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously lo whom. Glad of this mark af returning iritellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, lhey mentioned lhe name of tbe Earl os Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met wjth in society, Aubrey soemed pleasod, and astonished them still morc by his expressing his intenti0n to be present ot the nuptials, and desirjng to see his sifter. They answered not, but in a few miriutes his sistor was with him. He was apparently again capabIe of being affected by the influence of her love1y smjle; for he pressed her to his 6reast, and kisfed hcr cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's heing once more alive to the feelings ofaffectiori. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to corigralulate her uponher marriage with a person \u017fo diftinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; 0pening it, what was his surpri\u017fe at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influericed his llfe. He scized the portrait in a paroxysm af ragc, and trampledit under foot. Upon ber asking bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbclrid, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on hcr with a frantio exprefsion of countenarice, he bade her swear lhat she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But be could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thlnking Lord Ruthven was near him bvt saw no one. In the meantimo the guardians and physicion, who had heard tbe whole, and thought this was but a return of his disordcr, entered, and forcing himfram Miss Aubrey, desirod her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of thein to delay bul for one day. Tbey, attributlng this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven hadcalled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been rcfused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ilI health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exvltation and pIeclsure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this inf0rmation. He hastened to the houfe of his former coinpanian, and, by constant attendance, clnd the pretcnceof great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils ta recount\u2014could speak of himsclf as of an indiuidual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whomho addressed himself;\u2014could tell h0w, since be knew hor, his existerice, had begun to seem worlhy of prefervation, if it were merely that ho might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was tbe will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, hc obtained an important embossy, which served as an excuse for hastening tbe marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to tclke place the very doy before his departure for tho continent.\nAubrey, when he wos left by the phy\u017fician arid his guardians, attempted to bribe the scrvants, but in vain. Hc asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sifter, canjuring her, as she valuod her own happiness, her own honour, arid lhe horiour of those now in the grave, who onccheld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their hou\u017fe, to delay 6ut for a few hours lhat marrjage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servclnts promised they would de1iver it; but giving it lo the phyfician, he thought it better not ta harass any more tbe mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pa\u017fsed 0n without rest to the 6usy inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may more easjly he conceived than described, tbe n0tos of busy preparation. Morning came, and thc sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almosl frantic. The curiosity of the servclnts ot last ouercame their uigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the cuftody of an helple\u017fs old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly afsembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his orm by force, hurried him from the room, speeohle\u017fs with rage. When on the slaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oatb, and kriow, if not my bride to day, yovr sisler is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pvshed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not fjnding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bod. Thls was not mentioned to his sistor, who was not present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom lest London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sistcr'\u017f guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour bad struck, he relatod cornposodly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastenod to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disclppeored, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst os a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER,CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all beforehim, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board oneof his Majesty's vessels, in tbe year 181z, we put into the harbour os Mityleno, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo and vegelclbles always ta be had there, induce mclny British vessels to visit it\u2014botb men of war and merohantmen; and though lt lies rather out of the trock for ship\u017f bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed; as usual, at tbe bottom of the bay, and whilst the mcn were employed in watering, and lhe purser bargaining for cattle wilh the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave calIed Homer's Sohool, and other places, wbere we had been before. Ori the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greck as our guide, who told us hc had come from Scio witb an English lord, who left tbe island four days previous to our arrival in hi\u017f felvcca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sajd lhe Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not ohoose to quit Mitylene, where I ain likely to gct married. He was an add, but a ucry good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs t0 him, and he has left an old man in cbarge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (aboul Lz50 English currency,) and has re\u017fided there about fourteen months, though not conslantly; for he sails ln his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haslening tolhe house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us ovor the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hclll, a drawing-room, a silting parIour, and a bod-room, with a \u017fpaci0us closel annexed. They were all siinply decorated: plain greeri-stajned walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, whlch could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leariing posture; a large couch or sofa comp1eted the furniture. In tho haIl stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an ompty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pclintlng. The bedchambor had morely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed colton quilts and a pillow\u2014the co mmon bed throughout Greeco. In the sitting-room wo observed amarble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were lhen in a large seaman's chest in the cl0set: it wa\u017f open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Last, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English hook of any description. Most of these books were filled with margjrial notos, written with a pencil, ln Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all ouer, and marked with slips of paper, on wbich also were romarks.\nThe 0ld rnan said: \"The lord had been readlng these books lhe evening before he sailed, and forgot t0 place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thoy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thjng withovt orders, be wovld frown upon me for a week logether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm far tbe trouble of takirig care of il, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeniari who resjdes in a small cottage in the wood, and wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for whal reason.\"\nThe appearance of the bouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty pac es long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pIinthf and fret-work cornices, (as jt is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were o0nsiderahly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stonc balustradc, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning af strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are lhus furnished, as upon thom the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smoking, dr inking light wines, such cls \"lachryrna christi,\" eating frujt, and enj0ying the ovening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the hause, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orange\u017f and 1imes were clustering togcther on its borderf, and under tho shade of two large myrtle 6ushes, a marble seat with an 0rnamental wooden back was placed, on which we wero tol d, the lord passed many of his evenings and nigbts till twelve o'clock, rooding, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppo se,\" soid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very dovaut, \"and always attended our church twice a week, 6esides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vlneyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on tho suminit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestjc decoy. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woodf near lhe mountain's base. Tho fea smaoth as glass, and an borizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiriates the uiew in front; anda little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and pcllm-trees, sevcral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light bluc wave with spots os emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a vjow moro than I did tbis; but our enquiries were frultless as to the name of the porson who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Domlnick, his banker, who had garie to Cclndia. \"The Armenian,\" sclid our conductor, \"could tcll, bvt I amsure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old frierid?\" said I\u2014\"If I oan,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visil lhe Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt soveral particulars of the is0lated lard. He had portioned eight young girls when he wos last upon the island, and even danccd with lhem at the nuptial feast. He gave cl cow to one man, horses to otbers, and cotton and silk lo the girls who live by weaving the\u017fe artlcles. Healso bought a new boat for a fjsherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamenls to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from oll we collected, to have been a veryecccntric arid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, whjch our old friend at the cottage th ought proper not to disclose. He had a mast beautiful daughter, with whorn the lord was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful is1e of MityIenc; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. Hc had mo ney it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all thase eccentrjcities whieh inark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were difpelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, wbo had beon travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said be, \"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travelson the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at MityIene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chllde Harolde\" being put inlo our hands we recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in e vory page. Deeply did we regret n0t having been more curious in our rcsearches at the cottage, but we consoled aurse1ves with the idea of returnjng lo Milylene on some future day; butto me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite unintcresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, whichhas been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeoling di\u017fposition, aver\u017fe to associating with human nature, or contributing iri ariy way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathored from these llttle clnecdates. All the finer foelings of the heart, so elegclntly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their soat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actians: ond his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a beirig on whose heart Religion bath sel her seal, and over whose head Bencvolence hath throwri her montle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to hif loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reparts are ever to be received wjth caution, particularly when directed againsl man's moral integrily; and he wbo dares juftify himself before that awsul tribunal whcre clll must appear, alone may cen\u017fure the errors of a fellow-rnortal. Lord Byron's cbaracter is warthy of his genius. To do good in fccret, ond shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.","4":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Jahn William PoIjdori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to tho Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has orily assumed its present form since tbe division of the Lotin and Greek churches; at wbich time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their torritory, it graducllly increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead ri\u017fing from their gra ves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, aIl over Hungary, Poland, Austria, ond Lorralne, where the beIief existed, thclt vampyres njghtly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilft these human blood-suckers faltened\u2014and tbeir velns became distended to svch a stote of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very p0res of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, l732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a partjcular case of vampyrism, whioh is stated to have occvrredat Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appeclrs, that upon ari cxamination of the commander-iri-ohief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affjrmed, lhot, aboul fivo years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pclul, had beeriheard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented bya vclmpyre, but had faund a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of thc vclmpyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after hi\u017f death and bu rial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that fovr persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, tbe inhabitants havjng consuIted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (cls is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting clt the mou th, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having beeri thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driveri entirelythrough the beart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he if reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he bad been alive. This done, they cul off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashef into his grave. The same measvre\u017f were adopted with thc corses of those pe rsons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, becoine agents upon olhcrs who survived them.\nThe univerfal belief if, that a person suckod by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hiinself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThls monstrous rodomontade is bere rclated, beocluse it seems better adapted to illustrclte the subjeot of the present observatjonf lhan any other instarice which could be adduced. In many parls of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftcr death, sor some helnous crime committed whil\u017ft in oxistence, that the deceased is not orily doomed to vampyrise, but c0rnpeIlcd lo oonfine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he lovod most while upon eorth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties of kindred and affectian.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut fir\u017ft on oarth, as Varnpyre scnt,Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt tbenative placo, And suck tbe blood of all thy rclce; Tbere from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of 1ife; Yet loalhe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy viclims, ere they yet expjre, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou curfjng them, Thy flowers are withered on tho \u017ftem. But ono that for thy crime must fall, Theyourigest, besl beloved of all,Sball bless thee with a fathor's riame\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou musl cnd thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014ber eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowcd hand shall teclr The tresses 0f her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest p1edge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memor ial of tbine agony! Yel with thine own best hlood shall drip; Thygna\u017fhing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits r ave, TilI these in horror shrink away Fram spectre moro accursed lhan they.\nMr. Southey has als0 inlroduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalclba,\" tbe vampyre oorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned froin tbe grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But lhis cannotbe supposed to have rosulted from the sinsulness of her life, fhe being pourtrayed throughout the wh0le of lhe tale as a c0mplete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefortgives a 1ong account in hif trclvels of seueral astonishing cases of vainpyrism, to wbich he prelends to have been an eyowitness; and Calmet, in his greal wark upon this subject, hosides a varioty of anecdotes, and trodilionary narratjves illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, lending lo prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mlght be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessorily devoted to explanation, clnd which may n0w be concluded hy merely remarking, that tho ugb the lerm Vampyre is the one in most gencral acceptation, thero are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: af Vrouc0locha, Vclrdoulocha, Gou l, Broucolokcl, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happenedlhat in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at thc various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. Ho gazed upon tho rnirth around bim, as if he could not partlcipate therein. Apparently, the light laughtcr of the fair only ottracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those hreasls whero thoughtle\u017fsness rejgned. Tho\u017fe who feIt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fjxing upon the object's foce, did not seemto penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings af the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leclden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarilies causcd him to be invited to every bouse; all wisbod to see him, and tboso who had been accvstomed to violent exoiteinent, and now felt tbe weight af ennui, wero pleased at hauing something in their pre\u017fence capabIe of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of hi\u017f face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though ils form and outline were boavtiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety altempted to win his attentlons, and gain, at least, sorne marks of whcltthey might term affeolion: Lady Mercer, who had been the moekery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sinee her marriage, throw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attroct his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were clpparently flxed upori her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceiucd;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and sbe left lhe field. But though the eommon adultress could not influence even lhe guidance of hi\u017f eyes, it was nat that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent coution witb which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Hehad, howeuer, the roputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular charoct er, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females wh0 form lho boast of their sexfrom their domestic virtues, as clmong those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lond0n a young genlleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister iri the posse\u017fsion of great weallh, by parents who died while be was yet in childhood. Left also lo himself 6y guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortuno, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of meroenary \u017fuhalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feellng of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thovght thal vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, os wc seo in romances: he thought lhat the mi\u017fery of a cottage merely consisled ln the vesting of clothef, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patohe\u017f. He thought, in fine, lhat the dreams of poets were the realitios os life. He was handsome, frank, arid rich: for these reasons, upan hls entering jnto the gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded hirn, striving which shouId describe with least truth their languishlng or romping fovourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenances wheri he approached, and 6y their sparkling eyes, when he apened bis lipf, soon led him into false notioris os his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romanee of his solltary hours, he was startled at fjnding, lhat, except in the tallow clnd wax candles that slickered, notfrom the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in real life sor any of tbat congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he bad formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he wa\u017f about to relinquish his dreams, whon the extraordinary being we have above describod, crossed blm in his careor.\nHe watched him; and the very impossjbility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himsels, who gave few other signs 0f his obscrvatiori of external objects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginaliori to picture euery thing that flattered its pr0pensity to extravagant idecls, he soon formed this object inlo the hero of a romance, clnd determined t0 obserue the ofsspring 0f bis fancy, ralher than the person before him. He bocame acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that hi\u017f presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt thot Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notef of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was clbout to travel. Desirous of gclining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, bad only whetted his curiosity, hchinted ta his guclrdians, lbat jt was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generatjons has been thought necessary to enable lbe yovng to take some rapid steps in tbe car eer of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, arid not allowing them ta appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewri in carrying them on. They consented: and Au6rey iminediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surpriscd to receive frorn bim a proposal to join him. Flaltered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accc pted it, and in a few dayf lhey had passed the circling waters.\nHjtho-\nrto, Aubrey had bad no opporturiity os stvdying Lord Rvthven's character, and n0w he found, tbat, thougb many moro of hi\u017f actions were expofed to his view, the results offered different conclusiaris from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion wa\u017f profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough lo relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upan the virtuous, rcduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppresfed sneers; but when the prof1igclte came to ask som clhjng, nol to relieve his wants, but to allow hiin to wallow in his lust, or to sink himstill deeper in hi\u017f iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. This was, however, clttributed by him to tho greater importuriity of the viciaus, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuouf indigent. There was one circumstance about the cbarity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for lhey were all cither led to thc scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns thr0ugh which they passed, Aubrey was surprized ot the apparent eagerness wilh which his companion fougbt for the centres of a1l fashionable viee; there he entered into all the spirit of the farotable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was alwoys with the same unchonging faco, with which he generally watchcd tbe socjety around: lt was not, however, so when be encouritered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fother of a num erous family; then his very wish seemed fortune'\u017f law\u2014this apparent abslractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sporkled with more fire than that of the eat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, heleft the formerly affluent youth, lorn froin the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the folitude of a dungeon, the fclte that had drawn him within the reclch of this fiend; whilst many a fother sot frantic, amidst the speaking 1ooks of mute hungry children, withovl o sirigle farthlng of his late immense wcalth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present c rauing. Yet he took no money from the gombling table; bul immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the last gilder he had just snatehed from the convul\u017five grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich wa\u017f not, howevcr, capclble of eombating the cunning of the mare experienced. Avbrey often wished to represent this to his frlend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleclsure wbjch proved the ruin of all, and did nol tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking srankly and openly to him; h0wever, thif never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carrlage, and amidst the various wild clnd rich soenes of nalure, was alwayf the same: hls eye spoke less tban his lip; clnd though Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, he obtained no grcater gratificati on from it tban the conslonl oxcitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hif exalted imagincltion hegan to assume the appearance of something supernalural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of hi\u017f companion; he left him in dally attendorice upon the morning circle of an Italian eountess, whllst he went in soarch of the memorials of another almost deserled city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he openedwilh eager impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathingnothirig bul affeclion; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it hadbeforo entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him suffioient reason for the belief. His guardlans insisted upon his lmmediately leaving his frierid, and urged, that his character was drea dfully vicious, for that the po\u017fsession os irre\u017fistible powers of seduction, rendered his liccntious habits more dongerovs to society. It had been discovered, tbat his conlempt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred 0f her cbaracter; but that he hod required, to enharice his gratification, that his vlctim, tho partner of his guilt, should be hurled froin the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowesl abysf os infamy and degradcltion: in flne, that all those females whom he had sought, apporently on account of lheir virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deforinity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which lo rest thc eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretextfor abandoning him altogether, purp0sing, jn the mean whilc, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circvmstanccs pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lord\u017fhip was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly freqverited. InItaly, it is seldomthat an unmarricd female is met with in \u017fociety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in seeret; but Aubrey's eye followed hjm in all his windings, and soon discovcred that an assignation had been appointed, whicb wouId most likely end in the ruin of an innocenl, though thoughlless girl. Losing no time, he ontered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was awclre of his being about ta meet hor that very night. Lord Ruthven answored, that his intentlons were \u017fuch as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whethcr he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retlred; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fr0m that moment he must decline aecompclnying his Lordship in the reinainder of their prop0sed tour, he ordered his servant to seok other apartmenls, and calling upon the molher of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to ber daughter, but also eoncerning the character of his Lordship. Tbe assjgnatiori was preventcd. Lord Ruthven next dcly merely senl his servant to notjfy his completo assentto a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interp0sition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his \u017fteps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon f0und himself ol Atbens. He tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, asbamed of ehronjcling thedeeds 0f freemen only before slaves, hcld hidden themselves beneatb the sheltering soil or many col-\noured lic hon. Under the same ro0s cls himfelf, existed a being, so beautiful and doljeale, that she might have formed the model for a painter wjshing to pourtray on canv-\nass the promiscd hope of thcfaitbful ln Mahomet's paradjse, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any 0ne to lhi nk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one wauld have thovght lhe gazel1e a poor type of her boauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of clnimated nature, for that sleepy luxuriovs look of the ariimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acc0mpanied Aubrey in bis search afler antiquilief, and oftcn would the vncon\u017fciovs girl, erigagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere bvtterfl y, show the whole beavty of her form, floating as il were upon the wirid, tathe eager gaze of him, who forgot the lettcrs he had just decyphered upon an aImost effaced tablet, in the contemplaliori of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, a\u017f she flitted arourid, cxhibit in tho sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swjftly fading hues, it might well excufe the forgelfu1riess of the antiquary, who letescclpe from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital jmportance to tho proper interpretatiori of o passage in Pausanios. But why attompt to describe charms whicb all feel, but none cari appreciate?\u2014It was innocenoe, yauth, and beauty, unaffected by orawded drawing-ro0ms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserue a memorial for his fvture hours, sbe wovld stand by, and wotch thc magic effects of hif pencil, in traoing the scenes of her ncltive place; she would then describe to him the circling dancc upori the open pIain, would paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memor y, themarriage pomp she rememhered viewing in her infancy; and then, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tcll him all the supematural tales of hcr nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and 0ften as she told bim the tale ofthe living vampyre, who hcld passed years amjdst his frierids, arid dearest ties, forced every ycar, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to p rolong his existonce for the ensuing mariths, his blood would run cold, whilsthe attempted to laugh her oul os such idle and horrible fantasics; but Ianthe cited to him the names os o1d men, who had at last detected one living among thcmselvos, after several of their near relativef and childreri had been found marked wilh the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when sbe found him so incredulous, she begged of him to belleve her, for it had 6een, remarked, that lh0se wbo had dared to queslion their existence, always had some proos giuen, which obliged them, witb grief and heartbreaking, to confess lt was true. She detailed to him the traditiona1 appcarance of lhese monsters, and his horr0r was increosed, by hearirig a pretty accurate doscription of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persisted in persuading her, lhat thcrc could bo no lruth iri her fears, thaugh at the same time he wondered ot lhe many coincidences which had al1 tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began lo attach him\u017felf moreand inore to Ianthe; her innoeence, \u017fo c0ntrasted with all the offecled virtues of the women among whom he had sought f0r hjs vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea 0f a young man of Englisb hahits, marrying ari uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and morc attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear hirnself at times fram her, and, formjng a plan for some antiquarjan research, he wovld depart, determined not to return until his object was clttained; but be always faund it impossihle to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retainedan imoge that seemed alono the rightfuI possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infanli1e bejng he had first known. She always seerned to part from him with reluctance; but it was becavse she had no longer any one with whom she could visither favourite havnts, whi1st her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructiue hand of timo. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and lhey both, wilh several present, affirmed their existerice, pale witb horror at lhe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determjned to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, wherc no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impendingupon him who dared to cross thejr path. Aubrey made light os thcir representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; 6ut when he saw lhern shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of whichapparently made their blood freeze, he was silont.\nNexl morriing Aubrey set 0ff vpon his exo-\nursion unattended; hc was surprised to observe the melancholy face of hjs bost, and was concerned to find that his words, mooking the 6elief of those borrible siend\u017f, had irispired themwith such terror. When he was about to depart, Iarithe came to lho side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retvrn, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; \u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the harizon there wa\u017f one of tbo\u017fe specks which, in the warmer climcltes, s0 rapidly gathcr irito a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at lasl, however, mounted his horse, determinod to make upby speed sar his delay: but it wos too lato. Twilight, in these southern cIimates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere ho had advanced far, the power of lhe storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interv al of rest\u2014its lhick hea vy rain forced its way through the canopying faIiage, whilst the blve forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and be was carried with dreadsul rapidity through the entang1ed forest. The animal al last, thraugh faligue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from themasses of dead leaves and brvshwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to tbe town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from thc pelting of the storm. As hc approached, the thuriders,for o moment silent, all0wed him to hear the dreadsul shrieks of a woman mingling with lhe stlfled, exultant mockery of a laugh, conlinued ln one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the tbunder which agalri rolled over his he ad, he, with a sudden effort, foreed open the door of the hut. He found hjmself iri utter darkness: the soun d, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds cantinued, and no notice was laken of bim. Hc sound hlmself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voioe cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt him\u017felf grappled by one whose strongth seemed svperhuman: deterinined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but lt was in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled with enormovs force ag ainst the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himsolf upan hlm, andkneeling upon his breast, had placed hi\u017f handsupon his throat\u2014when theglare of many torchos penetrating through the holo that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crasbing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, wos no 1onger heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; tbe light of their torches feIl upon the mud walls, and the thatch l0aded on everyindividual straw with hcavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey thoy searcbed for her who had attracled him by her cries; he was agoin left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more 6urst upon bim,to perceive thc airy form of his fair cond uctress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arisirig from hif distvrbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cbeek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness aboul her face that seeined almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt tbere:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throot were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pojnted, crying, simultaneously struck wilh horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litterwas quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the slde of her who had lately bcen to him the objcct of so many bright and fairy vlsians, now sallen with the flower of life that hod died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014hif mlnd was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and take refuge in vacaricy\u2014he beld almost unc0nsciously in his hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, whieh had been found in thc hut. They wcre soon met bydlfferent parties who had 6een engagcd in the fearch of ber whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable crles, as thcy approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadfvl catastrophe. \u2014To describe their gries would be impassible; bul when they ascertained the cause os their child's dealh, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolclblc; bolh diod broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violcnt fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Rvthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some uriaccounlable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions up0n his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chonced at this time t0 arrive at Athens, and, from wbotever motive, upon bearing of the state of Aubrey, immcdiateIy pIaced himself in the same house, and becarne his constant attendant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, hewas horrified arid startledat the sight of him whose image he had now combjned with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had causod tbeir separation, and still more by the attention, clnxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciIed him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathotic being who had so astonisbed Aubrey; but as soon as his convalefcence began ta be rapid, he again gradually rotired lnto the same state of mirid, and Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, excepl that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inalicious exultation playjng upon his lips: he knew not why, but thi\u017f smile haunted hlm. During the last stageof the invcllid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tldeless waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, or in marking the progross of tbose orbs, circling, like our world, the movelosf sun;\u2014indeed, he appeored to wlsh to avoid the eyes os all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elaslicity of spirit which had 0nee so distiriguishod him riow seemed to hclve fled sor ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; 6ut much as he wished forsolitude, his mind could not find il in the neighbourhood os Athen\u017f; if be sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly frequented, Iclnthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought lt in tbe woods, ber light step would appear waridering ainidst thcvnderwood, in quest of tho modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would \u017fhow, lo his wiId imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meok smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed lo Lord Ruthven, to whom hc held himself b0und by the tender care he had taken of him during hls illness, lhat they should visit those parts of Greece neithcr had yet seon. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to wbich cl recolleotion could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed nol to heed what thoy gazed up0ri. Thcy heard muoh os r0bbers, but they gradualIy began to slighl these reports, whiob tbey imagincd were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the genorosity of lhose whom they defended from pretcnded dangers. In consequence 0f thus neglecting lhe advice of lho inhabitarits, on one occasion they trauelled with 0nly a few gvards, m0re to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, wlth large masfes of rock brought down from the neighbovring precipioes, they had reason to repent their negligenco; for scclrcely were the whole of the pclrty engaged ln tho narrow pass, wheri they were startIed by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood roport of several guris. In an instant the ir guards had left them, and, placing lheinselves behind rockf, had begun to fire jn lhe direction whence the reporl came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating tbeir example, retired for a moment behind the sbeltering turn of tbe defile: 6ut ashamed of being lhus dctained by a foe, who with insultlng \u017fhouts bade thom advance, and being exposed to unresisling slavghter, if ariy of the robbers should cliinb above and take thein in the rear, they determined at once to rush sorward in soarch of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter os the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe ground. Aubroy hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heeding the contestor hjs own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around bim\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's beirig wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great rcward, Aubrcy soon induced them to convey hjs wounded sriend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agrecd upon a rans0m, he was no more disturbed 6y their presence\u2014they being content inerely la guard the entrance till their comrode sbovld return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in tw0 days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not changod; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towords the olose of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who wos indueed to ofser his assistance with more than usual earneftness\u2014\"Assist me! y0u inay save me\u2014yov may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the declth of my existence af little as that of the passing day; but you may save rny honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I wauld do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannol explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me,my honour were free sromstain ln tbe world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried lbe dying man, raising himself with exvltantvi0lcncc, \"Swoar by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and cl day you wi1l not impart your knowledge of my crjmos or death to any living bcing in any woy, whatever may happen, or whotever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swcar!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hjs pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhreyrelired lo rest, but did not sIeep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with thls man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oatb a cold shivcring came over him, as is from lhc pre\u017fontiment os s0mething horrible awaiting him. Rising oarly in the m0rning, he was about to entcr lhe hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a rob6er mot him, and informed hiin that il was no longer there, having becn conveyed by hjmself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacIe of a neighbouring mount, according to a pr0mise thcy had given his lord\u017fhip, that it sbould be expofed to the first cold ray of themoon lhat rose after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and takirig several af the men, determined to go and bury it upon tho spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the fummit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointod out the identical rock on whjch they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried lhe corpse for the fake of thc cIothes.\nWeary of a country iri which hc had met with such terrible misforturies, and in wbich all appareritly conspired to heighten that superftitious melarichoIy that had seized upon hif mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wait ing for a ve\u017fsel to oonuey him to Otranta, or to NapIes, hc occupied himself in arranging those efsects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst 0ther things there was a case conlaining several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggersand atagbans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprife at sindjng a sheath apparently ornamented in the \u017fame style as tbe dagger discovcred in the fatcll hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastenlng to gain further proof, he found lhe weapon, ond hjs harror may be imagined when he discovered that itfitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath heheld in his hand. His eyes seemed lo need no furthcr certainty\u2014thcy seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same uarying tints upon the hafl and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and loft no room for doubt; thcre were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hls way home, at Rome, his first jnquiries were coricerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their fortvne rulned, and she had not been h eard of since the departure of his lordship. Avbrey's mind become almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that thi\u017f lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He bocame morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in vrging the speed of tbe postilioris, as if he were golng to saue the life of \u017fome one he held dear. He arrived at Ca1ajs; a breeze, wbich seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Engllsh shores; and he hclslcned to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the paft. If she before, by her infantine carcsses, had gained his affection, now that the woman 6egan to appear, shc was still more attachirig as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowdcd apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind berieath. There was a molancholy eharin abo ut it which did not seem lo arise from miffortune, but srom some feeling within, that clppeared ta indicate a soul conscious of a brigbter realm. Her step was not that li ght footing, which strays where'er a butterflyor a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was neverbrightened 6y the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection,and would in her presence forget tbose griefs she knew destroyed hi\u017f rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that 0s the volvptvclry? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteon, and had not been presented t0 the world, it having heen thought by hcr guardians more fit that her presentatlon should be delayed untiI her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, lheresore, resolued lhat the next drawing-room, whicb was fast appraachirig, should be the epoch os her entry into the \"busy scerie.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansian of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whioh overpowored him. He could not feel interest abovt the frivolitles of fashionable strangers, when his mind had beeri so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determiried to sacrifioe his own o0mfort to the proteclion of his sister. They soon arriv od in town, andprepared for the next day, whieh had boen anri0unced as a drawing-room.\nThe c rowd was excessjve\u2014a drawing-rooin had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himfe1f, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembronce that the first time he had seen Lord Ru thven wos in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly \u017fei2ed by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast hlm, when he pcrceived, at a little di\u017ftance, the same figure whicb had clttracted his notice on thif spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm os a frlend, and forcing a passage through tbe crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven bome. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fjxed his hands upon his head, of if he wcre afraid his thoughts were bursting from hjs brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin\u2014cireumstances storled up ln dreadful arroy\u2014lhe dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he oould not believe jt possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imaginalion had corijured up the imagc his mind was re\u017fting upon. It was impossible that it could bo real\u2014he determined, thcrefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he oould not succeed in gainirig information. He went a few riights after with his sisler to the assembly os anear relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he relired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devou-\nring thoughts. Pereeiving, clt last, that many were leoving, he roused himself, andentering another room, found hjs sister surrounded by severaI, appareritly in earnest conversatiori; he altemptod to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to himthose features he rnost abhorrcd. He sprang forward, soized hjs sister's arm, and, with hurricd step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himse1f impeded by the crowd of seruants who werewalting for their lords; and while he was engaged ln passing them, he again hcard that voice whispcr close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached borne.\nAubrey became a1most distraoted. If before his mind had been absorbed 6y one subject, how much moro completely was il engrossed, naw that the certainty of the monfter's living again pressed upon his thaughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in valn that sbe inlreated him to explain to her what had coused his abrupt conduct. He on1y uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more hc th0ught, the more he waf bewildered. His oath startled hlm;\u2014washe thon to allow this monster to roam, bearing rujn upon his breath, amidst all he helddear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touchod by him. But even if he wore to break his oath, and discl0se his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employirig his own hand tofree the wor1d fromsuch a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For dayf ho rernained in this stote; shut up in his room, he saw rio one, and ate only when his si\u017fter camo, who, with oyes streaming with tears, besought hiin, for her sake, to support natvre. At last, no longer eapable of bearing stillness and solitude,he left his house, roclmed from street lo street, anxi0us to fly that image which baunted him. Hi\u017f dress become neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day svn as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer ta be recognized; at fjrst he returned with the evening lo tbe house; but at lclsthe laid him down to rost wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to fol1ow him; but they wore \u017foon distanoed by him who fled from a purfuer fwifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduot, however, suddenly changed. Struck with tbe idea that he left by his absencc lhe whole 0f hjs friends, with a fiend amongsl them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into s0ciety, and watch him closely, anxious to forewam, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached wilh intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, hjs inward fhudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society whioh affected him so strongly. When, hawever, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thoug ht proper to interpose, and, fearing thal his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high tjme to resume again that trust which bad been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parerits.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injurios and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, and of prcventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks ofwhat they considered folly, they erigaged a phy\u017fician to reside in tbe house, and take conslanl care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, s0 completely was his mirid absarbed by one terrible subject. His jncoherence became at lasl so greal, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would ofteri lie for days, incopable of being roused. He had become emaciatod, bis eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only fign of asfection andrecollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometime\u017f start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her nol to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near hlm!\" When, however, she inquired to whom hc roferred, his only anfwcrwas, \"True! true!\" and again he sank lnto a slate, whence n0t even she couId rause hlin. Thjs 1asted many monthf: gradually, howover, as the year was passing, his incoherencos becarne less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numbor, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the lclst day of the year, one of his gvclrdians eritering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situatjon, when hif sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of relurning intellect, of which they feared be had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be prescnt clt the nuptials, and desiring to see his sisler. They answered not, but in a few minvtes his sister was with him. Hewaf apparently again capabIe of being affectedby the lnfluence of her 1ovely smile; for he pressed her ta his breast, and kissed hcr cheek, wet with tearf, slowing at the thought of her brolher's being once moro alive to the feelings of affection. Ho began to speak with all hiswonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriago with cl person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived o locket upon her breast; apening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of lhe monster who bad so long influenced his life. He seized the portrclit in a paroxy\u017fm of rage,and trampled it under foot. Upon her a\u017fking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her fvture husband, be looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her wjth a frantie expression of cauntenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monfter, for be\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him rcrnember his aath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was neor him but saw no one. In the meantime the gvardions and physician, who had hcard thc whole, and thought this was but a returri of his disorder, entered, ond forcing him fram Mifs Aubrey, desired her to leave him. Ho sell upon his kriees to them, he jmplored, he begged of them to dclay but for 0ne day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had takeri po\u017fsession of his mind, endeclvoured to pacify him, and relired.\nLard Ruthven had calledthe morning after the drawing-room, and had been refusod with every one eIse. When he heard of Aubrey's ill bealth, he recldily understood himsolf to be the oause of it; but when he learned lhat he was decmed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly beconcealod from those among wham he hod gained this inf ormatian. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretenee of great affection for the brotber arid intcresl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who covld resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recaunt\u2014could speak of hjmself as of an individual baving no sympathy with ariy being on the crowded earth, save with ber to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had hegun to seem worlhy of prcservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing acoents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well howlo use the serpent'f art, or such wos the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title os the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important cmba\u017fsy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her hrother's deranged stote,) whicb was to take place the very day before his departure for the coritinent.\nAubre y, when he was left by tbe physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe thc servants, but in vain. He asked for pcn and paper; it was given him; be wrole a letter to hls sister, oonjuring her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of thase now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of tbeir house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on whiob he denounced lhe most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; bvt giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to horclss any more thcmind of Miss Aubrey by, what he c0nsidered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rcst to the busy inmates of thehouse; and Au6rey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than deseribed, tbo notes of busy preparation. M0rning came, ond the sound af carriages broke upon his ear. Auhrey grew almost frontic. The curiosjty of lhe servants at last 0vercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving hirn in the cuslody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with orie bovnd was 0ut of the room, and in a moment found himself in tbe apartmenl whcre aIl were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was tbe first to perceive him: he immediatoly approached, and, taking his arm hy force, hurried him srom lhe room, speechless wilh rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not rny bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" Sosaying, he pushed blm towards his atlendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in searoh of him. Aubrey cauld no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not prosent when he entered, as thc physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage wassalemnized, and tbebride and hridegraom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of tbe near approach of death. Hc desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardian\u017f hastened t0 protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrlved, it was too 1ate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, ond Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACC-\nOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &o.\n\"The world wos all besare him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one af his Majesly'f vessels, in the year 1812, wo put into thc harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pIaee, and the certaln supply of cattle and vegetable\u017f always to be hadthere, induce many Britjsh vesfels to visit it\u20146oth men of war and merchanlmen; and though it lies rather 0ut of the track for ships baund to Smyrna, its bountief amply repay for lhe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at tbe bottoin of the hay, and whilst the rncn were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with lhe natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave ealled Homer's School, and other placcs, where we had been before. On the brow of Mourit Ido (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with anEnglish lord, wbo left the island four days prcviou\u017f ta our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld have taken me with bim; but I did not ohoose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to got marricd. He was an odd, 6ut a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belangs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gclve Dominick, the winc-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in hif felucca very oflen to the different islands.\"\nThi\u017f account excited our curi0fity very much, and we lost no timc in hastening to the house where our countryman hadresided. We were kind1y received by cln old man, who eonducted us over the mansion. It cansisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor\u2014an entranee hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parl0ur, anda bed-roam, with a spaciou\u017f closet arinexed. They were all siinply decorated: plain green-stainod walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the eentre, and a small founlain beneath, which could be madc to play through lhe branches by moving a spring fix ed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed tho furn-\niture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an ompty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. Thc bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed through0ut Grecce. In the sitting-room we obferved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then ina large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, bul we did not th ink ourselues ju\u017ftified iri cxclmining the eontents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspearo's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's work\u017f complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerinan, in the German langvage; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebue's riovcls; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at ConstontinopIc, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most os these books were filled wjth marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itolian and Latiri. The Messioh wos 1iterally scribbled all ovcr, and marked with sllps of paper, on which also were remork\u017f.\nThe old man said:\"The lord had been reading these books tbe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place thcm wjlh the others;but,\" said he, \"there tbey must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one lhing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a fervice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of il, excopt twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeriian who resides in cl small cottage in the wood, and whorn the lord brougbt here from Adrianople; I dori't know for what reasori.\"\nTho appearance of the house externcllly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces lorig and fourteen hroad, and the fluted marble pillars with bIack p1inths and f ret-w0rk cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were corisiderably higher than lbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wcls covered by a fine Turkey earpet, berieath an awnirig of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-tops are thvs furnished, as upon them theGreeks poss their evenings in \u017fmoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma chrlsti,\" eating fruit, and erijoying the evening breeze.\nOn tbe left hand as we entcrcd the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges arid 1imes wero clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden baek was placed, on which we were told, the Iord passed many of his evenings and nights till twe1ve o'clock, reading, writirig, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always ottendedour cburch twice a wcek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A linc of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an aneient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decoy. A small streain issving from tbe ruins des ccnded in broken cafcades, until it was Iost in lhe woods near the m0untain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an harizon vnshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on lhe Ieft, through a vista of lofty che\u017fnul and palm-trees, several sinall jslands wore distinctly observed, sludding the ljght blue wave wjth spots of emerald green. I se1dorn enjoyod a view more than I did this; but our enqviries were fruilless as ta the name of tbe person who had resided in this romantie solitude: none knew hls name but Damjnick, his bariker, wbo had gone to C andia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you toll, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" Wo had not lime to visit the Armenian,bvt on ovr return to the town we learnt soveral particulars of lhe isolated lord. He had portioncd eight young girls whcn he was last upon the ifland, and even danced with them at tbe nuptial seast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thc girls who livc by weaving these articlef. He also bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who had lost his own in o gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, ho appeared to us, from a1l we collocted, to havc beon cl very occentric and benevolent character. 0ne circumstance we learnt, which our 0ld friend at the cottage thought proper nol to diselose. He had o most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had boughl her a piano-forte, and taught her himsclf the use of it.\nSucb was the inforination with which wo departed from the peacefvl isle of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on lhe rack, guessing who this ramblerin G reece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of dispositian, arid alI those eccentricities which mark peculjar gonius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fall ing in campany with Mr. FOSTER, the arehitect, a pvpil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco, \"Tbe individual,\" said he, \"about wh0m you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had ne ver thenheard 0f his lordship's fame, as we had boen some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of CaleIa in e very page. Deeply did wc regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cotlage, but we consoled ourselves with the ldea os returning to Mitylene ori some future day; but to me that day will riever return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has beeri grossly slandered. He has been described as os an unfeelirig disposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direclly the reverse, as may be ploinly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the firier seelings of lhe hearl, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's pooms, seem to have their seat jn his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and cbarity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solilude if an additional reas0n for marklng him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over wh0se head Benev0lence hath thrown ber mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his 1oves orpleafures, I do not assume a right to give an opiriion. Reports are ever to be received wilh caution, porticularly when directed against man's m0ral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before tbat awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is w0rlhy of his genius. To do good ln secret, clnd shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eourt, Fleet-stroet.","5":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tclle is founded is very general in the East. Am0rig thc Arabians it appears to he common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after thc establlshment of Christianity; and it has only as\u017fumed jts present form since the division of the Latin and Greck ohurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latln body could not corrupl if huried in their territory, it gradually jncreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from tbeir graves, and feeding upon the blood of tbe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that uampyres nightly im6ibed a certain portion of the bload of thcir victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, ond specdlly died of consumptions; whilst these bvman bload-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended ta such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow frorn all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very poref of their skins.\nIn the Londori Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account af a particular oase of vampyrism, which is stated to hclve oecurred atModreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an oxaminotion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the pIace, they positively andunanimously afsirmed, tbat, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of thc Turkish Servia, he had bcen tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eatirig some of lhe earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing bimsels with hls blood. This precoution, however, did not prevent him from becoming cl vampyre him\u017felf;for, abovt twenty or thirty days afler his deatb and burial, mony person\u017fcomplained of having been tormented by him, and a depositjon was made, that four persons had heen deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mjschicf, the inhabilants having cansuIted their Hadagni, took up the b ody, and found it (as is supposed ta be usuaI in casef of vampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free fr0m corruption, and emitting clt the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid bIood. Proof baving been thus obtained, they resorted lo the clccuftomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body 0f Arnold Paul, at which be js reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same mcasures were adapled with the corsef 0f those pcrsoris who had preui0usly died srom vampyrism, lest they should, in thejr turn, beeome agentf upon others who survived them.\nThe universal beliof is, that a person fucked hy a vampyre becomes a va mpyre himself, and svcks in hif turn.\nChief hcliliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, hecause it feems bctter adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many pclrts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infemal visitations solely to those beings hc loved most while upon earth\u2014those lo wbom he was bound by ties 0f kindred and affectlon.\u2014A supposition alIuded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vompyre sent,Tby corse shall from lts tamb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck lhe blood of all thy raee; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loalbc the banquel which perforce Muft feed thy livid llvjng corse, Thy uictims, ere they yet expire, Sball know the demon for their sire;As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy fIowers aro withered on the stem. But orie that for thy crime must fall, The youngeft, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee wilh a father's name\u2014 That word fhall wrap thy bcart in flamo! Yet thou must end thy task arid mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must viewWhich freezes o'er ils lifeless blue; Then wilb unhal1owod hand shall tear Thc tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in lifea lock when shorn Affectlon's fo ndest pledgewas worn\u2014 But now is 6orne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From fpectre more accursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey has also iritroducod in his wlld but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returnod fr0m the grave for the purpose of tormentjnghirn she best loved whilst in existencc. But this cannot be \u017fupposed to have re sulted from tbe sinfulness of her life, she 6eing povrtrayed tbrougbout the whole os the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whieh he pretonds to have been cln eyewitness; and Calmct, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of clneodotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative os its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; thovgh the present may suff-\nice for the limits of a riote, necessorily deuoted to explanati0n, and which may now be concluded by merely remarkin g, thot though the term Vampyre js the one iri most general acceptatlon, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of tho world: as Vrau colocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in thc midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, lhere appearedat tbe various parties of the leaders 0f the tori a nobleman, more remarkabIe for his singularltie\u017f, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, a\u017f if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fclir only attracted his atlentiori, that hemight by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thougbtIes\u017fness reigned. Thofe who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence jt aro\u017fe: someatlributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the objoct's face, did not seem to penetrote, and at one glaneeto pierce throvgh to the iriword worklngs of the heclrt; but feIl upon the cbcek with cl leaden ray tbat weighed upan the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be iriv ited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who hod been clccustomod to violent excitemcnt, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having somcthing in their presence oapable os engaging their attention. In spite of the deodly hue af his foee, which never gained a warmer tint, eitber frorn the blush of modesty, or from thc strong emotion of passion, th0ugh its farm and outline wcre beautiful, mariy of the female hunters afternotoriety attemptod to win his attentions, and gain, at leost, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Merc er, wbo had been the mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms slnee her marrjage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress os a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014thougb in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, thaugh his eyes were apparently fixed upori ber's, still il soemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014evcn her unappalled iinpudence was baffled, and she left the field. But thougb the common adultress could not influence ovon the guidclnce of his eyes, it was not that the feinale sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparenl cavtion with which he spoke to the virtuous wife arid innocent doughter, that few knew he ever addressed himsclf tofemales. He had, however, tbe reputation af a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was cls often arnong those females who form thc boast of lheir sex from thcir d0mestic virtues, as among thofe who \u017fully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there carne to London a young gentleman of the nclme of Aubrey: be wa\u017f an orpban left with an only sister in the possession of greclt weallh, by parents who died while he was yet jn childbood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thoughl it their duly merely lo take care os his fortune, while they reIinquisbed the more important charge of his mirid to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivaled more his imaginatjon than hi\u017f iudgmenl. He had, hencc, that high ramantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruinf so many mi1liners' apprentices. He belicved all to sympathjse with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the rnifery of a cottage merely consisted in tho vesting of elothes, which wore as warm, but which were hetter adaptedto tbe painter's eye by their irregu1ar folds and vorl0us coloured patcbes. He thought, jn fine, that the dreams of poels were the realilies of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into thc gay circles, manymotbers surroundcd him, slriving which sho uld dcscribe with least truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening counlenonees when he approachcd, and by their sparkling eyes, when ho opened his lips, soon 1ed him into false nolions of his talents and hi\u017f merjt. Attached as he was lothe romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow clnd wax candles thal flickered, not from the prosence of a gbost,but srom want of snuffing, tbere wa\u017f no foundation jri real lise for ariy of that congeries of pleclsing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from whioh he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compen\u017fation jn bis gratisied vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when thc extraordinary 6eing we haue above described, crosfed him in hjs career.\nHe walchod bim; and the very impossibilily of forming an idca os the character of a man entirely abs0rbed in hiinself, who gave few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, lhcln the tacit assent to lheir existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his jmagination to picture every thing that flattercd its prapensity to extravagant ideas, hesoon formed this objoct into tbe hero of a r0mclnce, and determined to obsorve the offspring of hif fancy, rather than lhe person before him. He hecame acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rvthven's afsairs were embarrclssed, and soon fovnd, srom the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was clboul lo traveI. Desirous of gaining fome informotion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to persorm lhe lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to eriable the young to take some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards pulting themselves upon an equality with the agod, and not a1lowing them to appcar as if fa1len froin the skies, whenover seandal0us intrigues clre mentioned as lhe subiects of pleasanlry or of praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn iri corrying them on. They consentod: clnd Aubrey immediateIy mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to recelve from him a proposal to j0in him. Flattered by suoh a mark af esteem from hiin, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circ1ing waters.\nHitberto, Aubrey had had no opporturiity of studying Lord Ruthven's charactor, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed t0 his view, the results offercd diffcrent conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse jn hls liberality;\u2014the idle, lhe vaga6ond, and the boggar, reoeived from his hand more tharienovgh to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not auoid remarking, thatit was not vpon tbe virtuous, redueed to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upori virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent frorn the doorwith hardly suppressed sneers; but when theprofligate oame to ask fometbing, not to relieue his wants, but to allow himt0 wall0w in hi\u017f lust, or to sinkhim still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, howeuer, attributed by him to the greater importunity os tbe vicious,which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of thc virtuous indjgent. There was one ciroumstance about tho charity of his Lordship, which was ftill more impresfed upon his mind: all those upon whom il was be stowed, inevitably found that t here was a curse upon jt, sor they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lawest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avbrey was surprized at the apparent eagemess with which bis companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there be entered into all the spjrit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonlst, ond then he lost even more than he goined; but it was always with lhe same unohanging face, with which he generally watched the society arourid: it was not, howevor, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless sather of a numerous family; then his very wifh seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparentobstroctedness of mind waslaid aside, ond hi\u017f eyes sparkled with more sire thon that of the cot whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In overy t own, he left the former1y affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursirig, in tbe solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of tbis siend; whilsl many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, witb0ut o single farthing of his late immense wealth, whcrcwith t0 buy even sufficient lo satisfy their prescnt craving. Yet he toak no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of mclny, the last gi1der he had just snatched frorn lhe convulsive graspof the innocent: thls might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, howevor, capable of c0m6ati ng the cvnriing of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reprefont lhis to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profi-\nt;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day ho hoped his friend would giue him some opportunity of speakirig frankly arid 0penly to him; however, this n ever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his earriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scencs af riature, wcls always the same: his eye spoke less than his llp; and thougb Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained n0 greater gratjfication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wisbing to break that mystery, which to his exalted irnagination began to assume the appearance of something fuperncltural.\nTbey soon arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight ofhis companion; he left bim in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an ItaIian countess, whilst he went ln search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he waf thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which be apened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; lhe others were frorn his guardianf,the latter astonished him; if it had before entercd into his imagination thal there was an evil power reslderit iri his companion, these seemed to give him \u017fufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upan his iminedlately leaving his friend, and urged, lhat his character wcls dreadfully vicjovs, for thot the possession os irresistible powers os seduction, render ed his licentious habits more dangerous to socicty. It had been dlscovered, thal his contempt for the adultress hod not orjginated in hatred of her cbaracter; but that he had required, t0 enhance his gratification, that hi\u017f victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss 0f infamy and degradation: in fine, that all th ose females wbom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrup1ed to expose the whoIe deformity of tbeirvices to the public gazc.\nAubrey determined up0n leaving orie, whose eharaeter had not yet shown a single bright point on whicb to reft the oye. He resolved to inverit some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pvrposing, in the mean while, to walch him more closely, and to let no flight circumstclnces pass by unnoticed. Hc entored int0 tbe samc circlo, and soon perceivcd, that bis Lord\u017fhip was endeavouring to wark up0n the inexperierice of the daughler of the lady wbose hause hc cbiefly frequenled. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmclrried female is met with in society; he was therefore obligod to carry on hls plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye fol1owcd him in all his windings, arid s0on discovcred that an assignation bad been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though tboughtles\u017f girl. Losing no time, he entered tbe apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly osked bim his intentions with refpect to tho lady, insorming him at thc same timc tbat he was awore of his beirig clbout to meet her thclt very nlght. Lord Ruthven answered, that hls intentions were such as he supposed all wovld have upon svch an occasion; and upon being pressed whcther he inlended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediotely writing a note, lo say, that from that moment he must dooline accompanying bis Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant ta seek othcr opartments, arid calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her ofa1l he kncw, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character os his Lordship. Theassignation was prevented. Lord Rutbven next day merely senl his fervant to nolify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of bis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubroy directed his slcps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himse1f at Athens. He tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded rec0rds of clnoient gIory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of cbranicling the deeds of freemen only besore slaves, had hidden theinselves herieath the sheltering soil or mony coloured lichon. Under the sarne roof as him\u017felf, existed a being, so beauliful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pairiter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the falthful ln Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyef spoke loo much mind for any one to think she could bclong to thoso who hod no souls. As she danced upori the plaln, or tripped along the movntclin's side, one w0uld have tbought the gazelle a poor type of her beavties; for whowould have exchanged her eye, app-\narently the eye of onimated nature, for that sleepy luxuriovs lookof tbe animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe oflen accompanied Avbrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girI, erigaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, show lhe whole beauty of her form, flaating as it were vpon the wlnd, to the eager gazo of him, wbo forgot the Ictters he had juft decyphered upon an almoft efsaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-liko figure. Ofteri would her tresses folling, cls \u017fho flitted around, exhibit in the sun's roy such delicatcly brilliarit and swif-\ntly fading huef, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of tbe antiqvary, who let escape from his mind the very obiect he had before thought of vilal importance to the proper interpretatian of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciato?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stlflirig balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, shc wovld stand by, and watch the maglc effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe scenes of her native plaee; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the operi pIain, would pclint, to him in all lhe glowing colour\u017f of youthfu1 memory, the marriage pomp she remembered uiewing ln her insancy; ond then, turning lo subjects tbat had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talos of her nurse. Her eamestriess and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest euen of Aubrey; and 0ften as shc told him thc tale of the living vampyre, who had pafsed years amidst his friends, and dearestties, forced every year,by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to prolong his existenee for the ensujng months,his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted lo lclugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; bul Iantho cited to him the names of old men, who had ot last detected one living among themselves, after severol of their near relatives and childron had been found marked with the stamp of tho fiend's appetite; and when she found him \u017fo inoredulous, she bcgged of bim to helieve her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged tbem, witb grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him tbe tradilianaI appearance of these monslers, ond his horror wa\u017f incrcased, by hearing a pretty aceurate description of L0rd Ruthven; he, however, sti1l persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, thougb at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supcrnatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began t0 ottacb himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so cantrasted with all the affected virtuesaf the womon among whom he had sought for bis vision of romance, won his heart; clnd while he ridicvled the idea of a young man of English habits, marryingan uneducated Greek girl, stjll hc found himsolf more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forrnjng a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determiried not to return until his o6ject was cltlained; but he always found it impossible to fixhis attentlon upon tbe ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image thal seemed al0ne the rjghtsvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantilo being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with re1uctance; but it was because she had no longer any one wilh whorn she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncavering some fragmerit whicb had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the su6ject of Vampyros, and they both, with several present, affirmed their exlstence, pale with horror at the very nclme. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one os his excursions, whioh was to detain him sor a few hours; when thcy heardthe name of the place, they all at once begged of him not lo return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greekwould ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upon any consideratian. They described it as the resort os the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the mosl heavy evils as impending upori him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; hut when he \u017faw them shudder at his da ring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, thc very name of which apparently made their bl0od freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; ho wcls surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hif word\u017f, mooking the belief 0f those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of bis horse, and earnestly begged ofhim to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings t0 be put iri action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupjed in his researoh, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horjzon there was one of those specks which, in tho warmcr climates, s0 rapidly gather into a lremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted covntry.\u2014He at laft, however, mounted his horse, determined lo make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twi1ight, in theso southern climates, is olmost unknowri; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and erc he had advanced far, lhe power of the storm was above\u2014its ecboing thunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rajn forced ils way through the cariopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly hi\u017f horse took frjght, and he was earried with dreodfulrapidity through the entangled forest. The animcll at last, through fati gue, stopped, and he found, by tbe glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel thclt hardly lifted itself up fr0m thc masses of dead loaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting lo obtain sheIter from the pelting of the storm. As he approachcd, tbe thunders, for cl moment silent, allowed hlm to hearthe dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a 1augh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled aver his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, tb0ugh he oalled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agairi baff1od!\" to which a lovd laugh succeeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whose strengtb seemed svperhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, ho struggled; but it wa\u017f in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014hisenemy threw him\u017felf upon him, and kneeIing upon his breast, had placed his hands up0n his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches perietrating through tbe hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him;\u2014he instantly roso, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the daor, and in a moment the cra\u017fhing os the branches, as he broke through the wood, was rio l0nger heard. The \u017ftorm was now still; and Aubrey, incclpable of movirig, waf soon heard by those wjthout. They entered; tbe light of thcjr torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At lhe desire of Avbrey tbey seclrched for hcr who had ottracted him by her cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light 0f the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of hjs fair conductrefs brought in o lifeless corse.He shut his eyes, hoping thal it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; bul he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour vpon her oheek, not even upon hcr lip; yet there was a stillness obout her face that seomed almost cls attaching as the life lhat 0nce dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was bIood, ond vpon her throat were the mclrks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to lhis the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qvickIyformed, and Aubrey was 1aid by tbe side of ber who had lately been tahim the object of somany bright and fairy visi0nf, now fallen with the flawer af life that had died within her. Heknew not wbal his thoughts were\u2014his mlnd was benumbed and seemed to shun reslectiori, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost uneonsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a parljcular construction, which had been found in the hut. They weresoon met by different parties who had boen engaged ln the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentabIe cries, as they approached the cjty, forewarned thc parents of some dreadful cataflrophe. \u2014Todescribe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the ccluse af their obild's death, they 1ooked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were incons0lable; both died broken-heartcd.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often deIirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combinalion he feemed to beg os his formcr coinpanion to spare the being be l0ved. Al other times he would iinprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him cls her deslroyer. L0rd Ruthucn, chanced at tbis time lo arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing os the state of Avbrey, iminediate1y placed him\u017felf in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Whcn the latter reeovered from his delirium, he was borrified clnd stortlod at the sjght of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hjs kind words, implying almostrepentance for the fault that had caused their separatjon, and still more by the attenti0n, anxiety, and carc which hc showed, soon reconciled him to hls preseriee. His lordshlp seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic bcing who had so astonishcd Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence begon to be rapid, he again gradually retlred into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perc-\neived no difference from the former man, except that at timos he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a srni1e of rnalicious exultati0n playing vpon his lips: he knew not why, but thjs smile haunted him. Durjng the last stage of the invalid's rocovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly engaged in watching the tideles\u017f waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of tbose orh\u017f, circling, like our world, the moueless sun;\u2014indeed, be appeared to wisbto av0id the eyef of all.\nAu6rey's mjnd, by this shock, was muoh weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distingvished hlm now scemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence a\u017f Lord Ruthven; but mvch as he wished for solitudc, hls mind covld not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if hc sought itamidst the ruinf he had formerly frequented, Iantbe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it iri the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly tvrning round, would fhow, to his wild imaginatjon, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her 1ips. He determined to fly soerie\u017f, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender core he had taken of hlm during his illness, that they should visit those ports af Greece nejther had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hasteried from placeto place,yet they scemed not to heed what thcy gazed upon. They heard muchof robber\u017f, but they gradually began to sligbt these reports, wbich thcy imaginodwere only the inventjon of iridividuals, wbose interest it was to excite the generosity of tho\u017fe wh0m they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting tbe advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serveas guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a riarrow defile, at tho bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down srom the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whoIe os tho party engaged ln the riarrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close ta their beads, and by theechoed report of several guns. In an instant their gvards had left them, and, placing themselves bohirid rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the rep0rt came. Lord Rvthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a momerit 6ehjnd the sheltering turn of tbe defile: but ashamed ofbeing thus detained by a foe, who with insultirig shouts bode thcm advance, and beirig exposed t0 unre\u017fisting slaughter, if any of tho robbers should climb above and lako them in the rear, they detcrmined at once to rush forward iri search of the enemy. Hardly had they 1ost the shelter of the rock, whcn Lord Rulhven received a \u017fhot in the sh0ulder, which br0ught him to theground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the conte\u017ft or his own peril, was soan surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immcdiately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promisef of great reward, Aubrey soon induced tbem to convey his wounded frierid to a neighbouring cabin; and hauing agreed upon a ransom, he was rio more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content merely ta guard the entrance till their comrade shouId return with the promised sum, for which he hcld an order. Lord Ruthveri's strength rapidlydecreased; in two days mortification ensued, and dcath seemed advoncing with hasty step\u017f. His conduct and appearance had not chonged; he seemed as urieoriscious of pain as he had been of the obje cts aboul him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind become apparently uneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his a ssistance with more thori usuol earnestness\u2014\"Assi\u017ft me! you may saue me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed lbe declth of my existence as little as lhat of the po\u017fsing day; but you inay sclve my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me h0w? I would do any lhing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I canriot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all yov know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shclll not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying inan, raising hlmself with exultant violence, \"Sweclr by clll yaur soul reueres, by all your riature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any liuing being in any way, whatever may hoppen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyef seomed bvrsting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" fajd Aubrey; he sunk loughing upon his pjllow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his ocquaintancc with this man rofe upon his mlnd, and he knewnot why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if sromlhe presentiment of s0mething horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the moming, he was about to enter tbe hovel in which ho had left the eorpse, when a robber met him,and informed him lhat lt was no loriger there, havirig been canveyed by him\u017felf and comrades, upon hls retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according lo a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that ro\u017fe after his death. Aubrcy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, whenhe had mounted to the summit he found no lrace of eitber the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed ovt the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a tlme his rnirid was b ewlldered ln corijectures, bul he at last returned, convinced that they had buried tbe corp\u017fe for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary ofa country in wbich he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his inind, he resalved to leave it, and soon orrived at Smyrna. While waitirig for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Nap1os, he oecupied himself in arranging those effects he had with bim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbings there was a case containing sev-\neral weaporis of offence, more or less adapted to ensvre the death of the victim. There were several daggers ond ataghans. Whilst tuming them over, and examinirig their curious sarms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented iri the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hasteriing to gain further proof, he f ound lhe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, thougb peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His oyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left n0 room for doubt; there were also drops of 6lood on each.\nHe left Smyrncl, and on his way home, at Rome, hif first inquiries were concerning the lady he had cltteinpted to sriatchfrom Lord Ruthven's seductiue arts. Her parents were in distress, their forturie ruinod, and she had not beeri heard of since the deparlurc of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almosl braken under so many repeoted horrors; he was clfraid that this 1ady had fallen a victirn to thc destrayer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed af the postilions, as if he were going to save tbe life of some one he held dear. Ho orrived al Ccllais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wlll, so0n wafted hlm to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri thc embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infariljne caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she wcls stiIl more attaching as a companlon.\nMiss Aubrey had riot that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. Tbere was none of that lighl brilliancy which only exists in the beatod atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her b1ue eye was never lit vp by thc levity of the mind benealb. There was a inelancholy charin clbout it which did riot seem to arise from mlssortune, but from some feeIing within, lhat appeored to indicate a soul conscious of a brigbter realm. Her ftep was not that light foollng, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may atlract\u2014it waf sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brlghtened by the smile of joy; but whcn her brother breathed lo her his affection, and wovld in hor prcsence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemod as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own notive spbere. She wos yel only eighteen, and had not beon presented to the world, il having heen thought by her guclrdians more fit that her presentation should be delayed untll her brother's return from the cont-\ninenl, when he mlght be her protector. It was now, thercfore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, sh0u1d be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansian of bls fathors, and fed upon the melancholy which averpowered him. He could not feel intere\u017ft clboul the frjvolities of fashianable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the euentf he had witnessed; but he determincd to sacrificc his own comfort to the proteclion of his sisler. Thcy soon arrived in tawn, and prepared for lhc next day, which had been announced as a drowing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-raom had not been held for a long tlme, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of roycllty, haste ned thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he waf stclnding jn a cornor by himself, heedlesf of all around him, engoged in the remembrance thal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himsels suddenly scized by the arm, and a vojce be recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre thclt would blast hirn, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure whicb had attracted his riotice on this spotupon his first entry into society. He gazed till his Iimbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obligod to take the arm of a frierid, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he lhrow himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rvthven again before him\u2014circumstances ftorted up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oatb.\u2014He roused himself, he could not beIieve it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upori. It wcls impossible tbat it could bc real\u2014he deterinined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to clsk concorning Lord Rutbven, the name hung upon bis lips, and he could nat succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after wilh his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himfelf up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, al last, that mony were leaving, he roused himsels, and entering another room, fovnd his sister surroundedby several, apparently in carnest coriversatiori; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned raund, and reveaIed to bim lhose features he mo\u017ft a6horred. He sprang forward,sejzed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he fourid himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waitirig for their lords; ond while he was engaged in passing them, he ogain heard lhat voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, bvt, h vrrying his sister, soon reochedhorne.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had bcen absorbed by one subiect, how mueh more complelely was it engrossed, now tbat thc certainty of the monster's living againpressed upon hjf lhoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, arid it was in vain thal she intreated him to ex ploin to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few w0rds, and thoso terrified her. The more he thought, the mare he was bewildered. Hisoath startled bim;\u2014was he then to allow this morister to roarn, bea ring ruin up0n his breath, amidst all be beld doar, and not avert its progress? His very sistcr mlght have been tovched by him. But even if he were to break his oalh, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe bim? He thought 0f ernploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but deatb, hc remembered, bad beori already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he sow no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At lasl, n0 longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street lo street, anxious to fly tbat image which haunted him. Hjf dress becaino neglecled, arid ho wondered, as often expo\u017fed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He wos no longer t0 be recognized; al first he returned witb the evening to tbe house; but at last he laid him down to re\u017ft wherever fatigue overto0k him. Hif sister, anxious for bis sclsety, emp1oyed people to follaw him; but lhey were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuerswifter than any\u2014srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly chariged. Stru ok wltb tho jdea that he left by his ahsence the wholo of his frionds, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfcious, he determined to enter again inlo society, and watch him closely, anxious to sorewarn, in spite of his oath, all whorn Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered irit0 a room, hjs baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, thal his sister wcls at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, sor her sakc, a society which affccted hiin so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavojIing, lhe guardians thovght proper to interpose, and, foaring that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which hod been before imposod upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiroufof saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him fr0m exposing to the gcneral eye those inarks of what they consldered folly, theyengaged a physicianto reside in the house, arid take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so oompletely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His inc0herence became at laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, inoapahle of being roufed. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014tbe only sign of affoctlon and recollection remaining displayed itself upon lhe entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks thot \u017feverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not louch bim\u2014if your love for me is aught, d0 not go near him!\" When, however, sho inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\"and again he sank into a state, whcncc not cven sbe c0uld rouse him. This lasted mclny months: gradually, bowever, asthe year was passing, his incoherences became less freqvenl, and his mind threw offa porlion of its gloom, whilst hjs guardian\u017f observed, that severaI times in the day hc would count upon his fjngers a definite num6er, and then smile.\nTbe time hcld nearly elapsed, when, upon lhe last day of the year, one of his gvardians entering his room, began lo converse with his physician upon the melancholy circuinstance of Auhrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his slster was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's alterition was attrclcted; he asked anxiously ta whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of wbich they feared he hadbeen deprived, tbey mentioned the nameof the Earl os Marsden. Thinking this was a yaung Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astanished them still more by his expressing his jntention tobe present at lhe nuptials, and desiring to see his sjstor. They answered not, but in a few minutef his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influenco of her lovely sinile; for hc pressedher to his breast, arid kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more aliue to the feelings of affection. He 6egan to speak with all his wontod warmth, and ta oongratulato hcr upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived o locket upon her breasl; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who hcld so long inslueneed his life. He seized lhe portrait in a paroxysrn of rage, arid trampled iturider foot. Upon hcr asking him why he thus destroyed the resemhlance of her future hus6and, he looked as if he did not understand ber\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But hccould not advclnce\u2014it seemed af if that voice clgairi bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord R uthven was near him but faw no one. Iri the meantime the guardians and physiclan, who had hcard the whole, and thought this was but a relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leave him. He fell upon bis knees to them, he implored, be hegged of them to delay but for one doy. They, attributing thjs to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured lo pacisy him, and retired.\nLord Rutbuen had ealled the morning after tho drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Au6rey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of jt; bul when he loarned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened ta the bouse of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenoe of great affection for the brother arid interest in his fate, hc gradually won tho ear of Miss Aubrey. Who c ould resist his power? His tongue had dangers arid tolls to rccount\u2014could speak of himself as of an lndividual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save wjth her to whoin he addressed himself;\u2014cou1d tell how, sinco he knew her, his existenoe, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to hor soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use lhe serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affeotions. The titleof the elder branoh falling at Iength to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excu\u017fe for hastening the marriage, (ln spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take placethe very day bef0re his departure for tho continerit.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servanls, bul in valn. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happine\u017fs, her own honour, and the honour of tbose now iri the grave, who once held her jri their arms as their hope and the hope of their hause, to delay but for a few bours that marriage, on which he denaunced thc most heavy curses. The servants promised thoy would deliver jt; but gjvirig it to the physician, he th0ught it better not to harass any morethe mjnd of Miss Aubrey by, wbat he considered, tbe ravirigs of a maniac. Night pclssed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a h0rror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy prcparation. Morning come, and the sound of carriages broke upon his eclr. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of thc servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually sto1e away, leaving himlri the custody of an helpless a1d woman. He seized the opp0rtunity, wlth one bound was out of the room, and in a moment faund himself in the apartment where all were nea rly assembled. Lord Ruthvon was the first t0 perceive him: he immedialely approacbed, and, takirig bis arm by force, hurried bim from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remeinber your oath, arid kriow, if not my bridc to day, your sisler if dishonoured. Women aro frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his ottendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Auhrey couldno longer support bimself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vesse1, and he was conveyed to bed. This waf not mentioned to bis sister, who was riot present when heentered, asthe physician was afraid of agitating her. Tbe mclrriage was solemnized, and tho bride and bridegroom loft London.\nAvbrey's weaknoss increa\u017fed; the effu-\nsion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be oalled, and when the midnight bovr had struck, be related composcdly what the reader has pcrused\u2014he djed immediately after.\nThc guardians hastoned to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had dlsappeared, and Av6rey's sisler had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT 0F LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LDRD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, wherc to choose his placo of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through tbe Grecian ArchipcIago, onboard one of his Majesty's vessels, in thc year 1812, we put into tho harbour of Mitylene, in the lsland of that namc. The beauty of this place, and lhe certain supply of catlle and vegetable\u017f always to be had there, induce many Brilish vosfels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchontmen; and thougb it lies rather out of the tra ck for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom af the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargairiing for oatt1e with the natives, the clergyman and rnyself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Schoal, and other places, wherewe had been bcfore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so riamed) we met with and cngaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who loft tho island four dayf prevlous to our arrival in his fe1ucca. \"Heengaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He wos an odd, hut a very good man. The cotta ge over the hill, fclcing the river, belongs to him, and he has lcft an old man in charge of jt: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hvndred zechines sor it, (obout L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excjted our curiosity vory much, and we loft n0 time in hastening to the house where our counlryman hcld resided. We were kindly receivod 6y an old man, who coriducted us over thc marision. It c0nsisted of sour apartments on tbe ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spaciaus closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walIs, marble tclbles on either side, a large myrtlo iri the centre, and a sm all fountairi beneath, which could be made to play through lhe branche\u017f by moving a spring fixed iri the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In tbe hall stood hals a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-casc: there were no mirrorf, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed ootton quilts and a pillow\u2014lhe common bed throughout Greoce. In the sitting-room wo o6served a marble recess, formerly, the old man told uf, fil1ed with books and pclpers, whicb were then jn a large scaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did nat think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tabIet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complcte; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's play of the Robberf; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pclrma in1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Canstantinople, much torri, but rio English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with margi nal notes, written with a pencil, iri Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips os paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe o1d man faid: \"Tbe lord bad been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to p1ace them witb the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, thal were I to move one thing withovt orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he i\u017f othcrways verygood. I once did him a ser vice; and I bave the produce of this farm for the trouble 0f taking care ofit, except twcnty zechines which I pay to an clged Armeniari who resides in a small cottage jn the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe oppearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. Tbe portico ln front was fifty pclces long arid fourteen broad, and the f1uled marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornlces, (as it is now customary in Greeian arcbitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded hy a light stone balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpet, benoath cln awning of strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon thern the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smoking, dririking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we enterod the hause, a small \u017flreamlet glided away, grapes, orclnges clnd limes wcre clustcring together an its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari ornamental wooden back was p1aced, on whicb we were told, the lord passcd many of his euenings and nights till lwelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prclying\" for he waf very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat wcls what may be termed \"a bjrd's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CalcIa, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek templc appeared jri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the rujns dcscended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountairi's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed bya single cloud, terminales the view in frorit; and alittle on the left, tbrough avista af losty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name os the person who had residod in this romantic solitude: none knew his name hut Domjnick, hls banker, wbo hcld gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, bul I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time l0 uisit the Armenlan, but on our return to the town we learrit seueral particuIars of the isolated lord. He had portion ed eight young girls when he waf laft upon the island, and even danced with thom at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton ond silk to the girls who live by weaving lhese articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishorman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to thepoor children. In short, be appcared to us, from all we collected, to have beeri a very eccentrjc and beneuolent c haracter. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper nat to disclose. He had a mosl beautisul daughter, with whom the lord was ofteri seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself tbo use of it.\nSuch was the information wjth whjch we departed from the peaceful is1e of Mitylone; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who tbis rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was euident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and aIl those eccentricities whicb mark peculiargcnius. Arrived at Palermo, all ovr douhts wcre dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil os WYATT'S, who had boen travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The indjvidual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visitcd hiin at MityIene.\" We had never then heard 0f his lordship's fame, as we had been some yeclrs from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into 0ur bclnds we recognized the recluse of Calcla jn every page.Deeply did we regret not having beon more curious in our refearches at the cottage, but we consolcd ourselves wlth the idea 0f returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to methat day will rievcr return. I make this statemerit, believing it not quite uninteresting, arid in justice lo his l0rdship's good name, which bas been grossly slondered.He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to afsociating with hvman nature, or contributing in any woy to sooth its sorraws, or add to ils pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gclthered from thesc Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depictcd in his lordship'f poems, seem to hove thcir seat in his hosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guidc clll his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is on addition a1 reoson for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolenee hatb thrown her mantle. No rnari can read lbe precedingpleasing \"traits\" witbout feeljng proud of him a\u017f a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleclfures, I do not assume a right to givc an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cauti0n, particularly when directed agoinst man's moral integrity; and he wbo dares justify himself before lhat awsu1 tribuncll where a1l must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron'scharacter is worthy of his gcnius. To do good in secret, and \u017fhun the world's applause, is the surest lestimany of a virtuous heart and self-clpprovirig conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-c0urt, Fleet-street.","6":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this talo js founded is very general in thc East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, h0wever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its pre\u017fent form since the divjsion of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thal a Latin body c0uld not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually iricreafed, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the deod rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beoutiful. In the Wesl it spreod, with some slight variation, all ovor Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where the belicf existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed cl eertain portion 0f the blood of their victims, wbo bocame emaciated, lost their strength, andspeedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and tbeir veins became distended to such a stale af replelion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the pa\u017fsages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin\u017f.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, os courso, credible aec0unt os a parlicular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, iri Hungary. Il appears, thol upon an examincltion of the commander-in-ohief and magistratef of theplace, lhey positively and unariimously afsirmed, that, about five years before, acertain H eyduke, named Arn0ld Paul, had beeri heard t0 say, that, at Cassovia, on lhe frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormerited by cl vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by eclting s0me of thc oarth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing hjmself with his blood. This precaution, howevor, didnot prevent him from 6ecoming a vampyre himself; for, aboul twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons cornpIained of having been tormented by him, anda deposition was made, that four per\u017fons had beeri deprived 0f life by his attacks. To preuent further mischjef, tbe inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took up tho body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free frorn corrvption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid 6lood. Proof havirig been thus obtoined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reporled to bave cried out as dreadfu1ly as if he bad 6een alive. This done, they cvt ofs hls head, burned his body, andthrew the afhes into his grave. The same measures were cldopted with thecorses of those persons who had prcuiously died froin vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their turn, 6 ocome clgents upon others who survived them.\nTbe unluersaI belief is, that a person sucked by a uampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChjef bailiff.\nThismonstrous r0domontade is hore related, hecause lt seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the presenl ob servations lhan any olher instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is eonsidered as a sort os punishment after dcath, for some heinovscrime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compe1led to canfine his infcrnal visilcltions solcly to those beings be loved m0st while upon eorth\u2014those to whoin he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition cllluded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall froin its tomb be rent; Theri ghastly haunt the native place, And suck tho blood of all thy rclce; There from tby daugbter, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loathe the ban quct which perforce Must feed thy livjd liuing corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers aro withered on the stom. But one that for lhy crime must fall, The youngest, best belovedof all, ShaIl bIesf thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap lhy heart in flame! Yet thou must ond thy lask arid mark Her cheek's last tingc\u2014hcr eye's lasl spark, And the last gla\u017fsy glance must view Which freezes o'er ils lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shalltcar The tresse\u017f of her yellow hair, Of which, ln life a lock wheri shom Affeetian's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine ago ny! Yet with thirie own best blood shall dr ip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard ljp; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Govls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre rnore accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also lntroduced in his wild but beclutiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the uampyre corse of the Arabian maid 0neiza, who is represented as hav ing returned from the grave sor the purpose of tormenting hlm she best loved whilst in existcnce. But this cannot 6e supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her llfc, she bcing pourtrayed throughout the whole of lhe tale as o complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives a long accourit in his trclvelf of several astonishing cclses of vampyrism, to wbich he pretcrids to have been an eycwitnefs; and Calmet, iri his great work upon lhis subjoct, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditi0nary narratives illustrative of ils efsects, has pvt forth some learned dissertations, lendirig to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting n0ticef on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the presenl may suffice for the limits 0f a note, necessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be eoncluded by merely remarkjng, that though the term Vampyre is the 0ne in most general acceptatiori, lhere are several others synonymous with it, made use of in variousparts of the world:as Vrouoolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHEVAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations ottendant upon a London winter, thcre appeared at the various parties of tbe leaders of the ton a noblemon, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth aro und him, as if he could n0t participate therein. Appareritly, the ligbt laughter of the fair on1y atlraoled his attention, that ho might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlesfne\u017fs reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it arose: some attributed it to tbedead grey eye, which, fixing upon tho object's face, did not seem to penotrate, and at one glance to pieree through to lhe inward workings of the heort; but fell vpon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could nol pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every houfe; all wished to see him, and those who had been occustomed to vio1ent excilement,and now felt the weight os ennui, were pleased at having somethlng in their presenee capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of hls face, whioh never gained a warmer tint, either from tbe blush of modesty, or fram the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attenti-\nons, and gain, at loast, some marks of wbat they mightterm afsection: Lady Mercer, who hadbeen the mockery os every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sinco her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did clll 6ut pul on the dress of a mountebarik, to attract bis notlce:\u2014though in uain:\u2014when fho stood before him, though his cyes were clpparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were uripercejved;\u2014evcn her unappcllled impudence was bafsled, and fhe Ieft the sield. But thougb the comm0n adultrefs could not influenoe even the guidanceof hjs eyes, it wcls not that the female sex was indifferenl to him: yet sucb was tbe apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wlfe and innocent daughler, that few knew he ever addressed hlmself t0 semale\u017f. He had, however, tbe reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that lt even overcaine the dread of hif singular character, or that lhey wero moved by his opparont hatred of vice, he was os often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their dome\u017ftic virtues, as amorig those who sully it by their vicef.\nAbout the same time, there cclme to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an 0rphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealtb, by parents who died while he was yet inchildhood. Left also to himself by guardian\u017f, who thoughl it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they reliriquished the more important charge of bjs mlnd to tbe care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated moro his imagination than his judgment. He had, henee, that higb ramantic fecling of honour and candour, which daily ruins sa many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thaught that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottagemerely consisted in the vestirig of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter'seye by lheir irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that tho dreams of poetf were the realities af life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay eircIes, mclny rnothers surrounded him, striving which should descrlbe with least truth their longuishing or romping favouritos: the daughters at the fame time, by their brightening countenances wben he approached, and by their sparkling eyos, when he opened his lips, soon led hirn into false riotions os his talents and hjs merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he wcls startled at finding, that, exccpt iri the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snvffing, there was no fouridation in real llfe for any of that congerie\u017f of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in thoso volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some cornpensation ln bis gratjfied vanity, he wa\u017f about to relinquifh his dreams, wben the extraordinary 6eing we have above described, crassed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the vcry imp0ssi-\nbility of f0rming an idea of the charac-\nter of a man entirely abforbed in him\u017felf, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, irnplied hy the avoidance of tbeir c0ntaet: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flclttercd its propensity to extravagant ideas, he foon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe lhe 0ffspring of hif fancy, rather thon tho person before bim. He became acquclinted with him, paid him ottentions, and so far advanced upon his n0tice, that his presenee was always recognised. He gradua1ly learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were ombarrasscd, and foon found, from the notes os preparation in \u2014 Streot, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gainirig some informatjon respecting this singular character, wbo, till now, had on1y whetled his curiosity, he hinted to hjs gvardians, tbal it was time for bim to perform the lour, which for many generatians bas been thought necessary to enable the yourig to take sorne rapid ftepf in tho career of vice towclrds puttirig lhemselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing thcm to appear as if follen from the fkie s, whenever scandalous intriguos are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accarding to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately menlioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receiue from him a proposalto join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from him, who, appclrcntly, had nothingin common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passcd the circling waters.\nHitherlo, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he f0und, that, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results ofscred diffcrent conclufjoris fram the apparent motives to hls conduct. His cornpanion was profuse in his liberallty;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to reliove their immediate waritf. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that hc hestowed his a1ms;\u2014these were senl from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profIigate came to ask something, not to relieve hjs wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him t0 the greater lmportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness 0f the virtuouf lndigent. There was one circumstanee about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more jmpressed upori hi\u017f mind: all th0se upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably fovrid that there was a curse upon il, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At BrusseIs and other towns through whjch they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion saught for the oentres af all fashionable vice; there be entered into all thespirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambIod with success, except where tbe known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the saine urichanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, howevcr, so when he enoounlered the rash youthf ul navice, or the luckless fatber af a numerous samily; then hif very wlsh seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparenl abstractedness of mind was laid a\u017fide, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cot whilst dallying witb the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left tho formerly affluent youth, torn from tbe circlo he adorned, cursing, in the soIitvde of a dungeon,lhe fate that had drawn him wlthin the roach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks af mute hungry childreri, without a single farthirig of hjs late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficiont to fatisfy their prefent cravirig. Yet he took no money from thc gambling table; but lmmediately lost, to tho ruirier of many, tbe Iast gilder he had just sncltched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this migbt but be tho resvlt of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combatirig the cunning of the more experiencod. Aubrey often wished to represent thif to his friend, clndbeg him to resign that charity and pleasvre which proved lhe ruin of all, and did nottend to his own profit;\u2014but he dela yod it\u2014for each day hehoped his friend would give bim some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthveri in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was aIways the same: his eye \u017fpoke less than his lip; and though Aubrcy was near the object of bis curiosity, hc obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vain1y wishing to break that mystery, wbich to bif exalled imagination began to assvme the clppearance os something fupernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he 1eft him in daily attendance upon the marning circ1e of an Italian countess, whilsl he went in fearch of the memorials of another alrnoft de\u017ferted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Erigland, which he opened with eager impatience; lhe sirst waf from his sisler, breathing nothing but affecllon; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it bad hefore entered into his imaginationthat there was an evil power resident in his compariion, theseseemed to give him \u017fufficient reoson for the belief. His guardians inslsted upon bis immodiately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully viciovs, for that tbe possession of jrrefistible powers of seductlon, rendered bis licentjous habits more dangerous to fociety. It had been discovered, that bis conternpt for the adultrosshad not originated in hatredof her character; but that he bad required, to enhance his gr atlficatjon, lhat hif victim, the partner of his gui1l, shovld be hurledfrom the pinnaole of unsulliod virtue, down to the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation:in fine, that all those femalos wham he had sought, apparently on account os thoir virtue, had, since his departure, thrown everi the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expase the whole d eformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey delermined upon leavirig one, whose character had not yet shown a single brjght poinl on whjch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretexl for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in tbe mean while, to watch him more closely, arid to let no slight cirevmstances pass by unnoticed. He cntered into the same circle, and soon peroeived, tbat his Lordship was erideclvouring to work upon tbe inexperlence of the daughter of the lady whose h0use he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimarried female is met wlth in society; hc was therefore ob1iged to carry on his plans in secret;but Avbrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that on assignation had been app0inted, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losingno time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rulhven, and abruptly asked him his intentions wilh respect to the lady, jnforming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to rneel her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thal his intentions were such as he supposed all would bave upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wriling a note, to say, that from that momenl he must decline accompanyjng his Lordship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only wjth regard to hor daughter, 6ut also concerning the character of his Lordshjp. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely scnt his servarit to notjfy his completo a\u017fsent t0 a separcltion; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interpositiori.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps lowards Greece, and crossing the Penlnsula, soon found himself at Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronlcling lhe deed\u017f of freemen only bcfore slaves, hcld hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or mony c0loured lichen. Under the sclme roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and deIicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourlray ori canvassthe promised hope of tbe faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that ber eyes spoke too much inind for any one to think she could belong to lh0se wbo had no s0uls. As she dancod upon the plairi, or tripped alorig the mountain's side, one wovld have thaught the gaze1le a poor type of her b eauties; for whowould have exohanged her eye, opparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious Iook of lhe animal suited but to lbe taste of an epicure. The light ftep of Ianthe oflen accompanied Aubrey jnhis search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of o Kashmere butterfly, shaw the whole beauty of ber form, floating as it were upon the wind, to tbe eager gazc of him, who forgot the letters he had iuft decyphered upori an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplatlon 0f her sylph-like figure. Often would ber trosses falling, as she flitted oround, exhibit in the sun's ray sueb delicately bri1liant and fwiftly fading hues,il rnight well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It wa\u017f innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifljng balIs. Whilst ho drew thafc remains of which he wished to preserve a meinorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and wcltch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would tben descri6e to him the circling dance upon lhe open pIain, would point, to him in all the glowing colours os youthful memory, thc marriage pomp sheremembered viewing jri her infancy; and then, turning to svbjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her eo rnestnesf and apparent belies of what sbe narrated,exciled the interest even os Aubrey; and often as she told hirn lhe tale of the living vampyre, who bad passed yoars amidft hjs friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a louely female to prolong his existence f0r the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of oldmeri, who had at lasl detected one living among themselvos, after several of their riear rolatives and children had been found marked with the slamp of the fiend's appetite; and when sbe found him so incredulous, she begged of hlm to believe her, for it had been, remarked, tbat those who had dared toquestion tbeir existence, always had some proof giveri, whieh obliged them, with grief arid heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the tradilional appearance of these monsterf, ond his horror was increased, by bearirig a protty accvrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still porsisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in hcr fears, thaugh at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excitc a belief in the fupernaturaI power of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so controstcd wilh all tho affected virtucs of lhe women am0ng whom he had sought for hjs visi0n of romarice, won hls heort; and whilo he ridiculed lheidea of a young mcln of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found hjmself more and more attachod to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian rescarch, he wovld depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but hc always found itirnpossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around bim, whilst iri his mind he retained an iinage that seemed alone the rightful posscfsor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconsciaus of hjs love, and was ever the same frank infanti1e being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him witb reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she couId visit her favourite haunts, whjlst ber guardian was oc cupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped tbe destructivo band of timc. She bad appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, wjth several present, affirmed their existenc o, pale with horror at the very naine. Soon aftor, Aubrey determined to proceed vpon one of his excursions, wbich was to detairi himfor a sew haurs;when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him nol to return at night, as he must necessorily pass through a wood, where no Greek wouId euer remain, afler lhe day had cl0sed, upon any consideration. Tbey described it as the resort of the vampyres in lhejr noctumal orgies, and denou nced the mo\u017ft heclvy evils af lmpending upan him who dared ta oross thcir path. Aubrey made light of their represeritcltioris, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder al his darlng thus to mock a superior, lnfernal power, the very name of whicb apparently made their blood free2e, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon bis excursion unatterided; bewas surpr ised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of thofo h0rrible fiends, hod inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came lo the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of hjm to rolum, orc night allowed the powerof thesc beings to be pul in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so oocupied ln his research, that ho did not perceive lhat day-light wouldsoon erid, and that in tbe horizon therc was ane of those specks which, in the warmer climatos, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their ragc upori the devoted cauntry.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but lt was too late. Twilight, in these southern climatcs, is almost unknown; lmmediately the sun sets, night begins: arid ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had soarcely an interva1 of rest\u2014its thick heclvy rain forcod itf way through the canapying foliage, wbilst the 6lue forked ligbtning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feel. Svddenly bis hor\u017fe took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the enlangIed forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fourid, by the glare of lightriing, lhat he wasin the neighbourhood os a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from lhe pelting of the storrn. As he approached, the thunderf, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrioks of a womcln mingling wjth the ftifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continuod in 0ne almost uribroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whicb again rolled ouer his hcad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in vttcr darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He wcls apparently unperceived; sor, though ho called, still tbo sounds coritinued, and no notice was taken of him. He faund hiinself in contact with some one, whorn he immediately \u017felzed; when o voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh \u017fucceeded; and he felt hiinself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to soll hl\u017f life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he waslifted from his feet and hurIed withenormous foree against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon bis brcast, had placed his hands upori hif throat\u2014wben the glaro of many torches penetrating thr0ugh lhe hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him;\u2014be instantly r0se, and, leaving bis prey, rushed lhrough the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through lhe waod, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable 0f m0ving, was soon heard by th0se without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes ofsoot. At the desire of Aubrey they seorched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but wbot was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnore burst upon him, to perceive the ajry f0rm of his fair conductress brought in o lifeless corsc. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wa\u017f bul a vision clrising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, wben he unclosed tbem, slretched by bis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face tbot seemed cllmost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon herneck and breast waf blood, and upon her throat were thc marks of teeth having opened tbe vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultarieously slruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had Iately been to him the object of so many brlght and fairy visions, now fallen with tbe flower of life thal had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed lo shun reflcction, orid take refuge jn vacancy\u2014he heId almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of cl par ticular constructjon, which had been found inthe hut. They were soon met hy different parties who had been erigaged in the search of hcr whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, os they approacbed the clty, forewarnedthe parents of some dreadfvl catostrophe. \u2014To doscribe their grief would be jmpossible; but when they afcerlalned tbe causc of their cbjld's dealh, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They wcre inconsolable; both died broken-heclrted.\nAubrey being put to hed was seized with a m0st violent fever, and was often delirious; in the\u017fe intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthvon and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combinatiori he seemed to beg of his sormer companiori to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictlons upon his head, and ourse him cls her deslroyer. Lord R uthven,chanced at this time to arrivc at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himse1f in lhe same h0vse, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrlfied and stclrtled clt the sight of him whose image he bad now combined with lhat of a Vainpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for thc fault that had cavsed their \u017feparation, ond still mare by the attcntion, anxiety, and care which ho showed, soon reconclled him to his presence. His lordship secmed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convaIescence began lo be ropid, ho again gradually relired into the same state of mind, andAubrey perceivod n0 difference from the former man, excepl that at times he was surprised t0 meet his gaze flxed intently upon him, withcl smile of malicious exultaljon playing upon his lips: he knew nol why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wavef raisedby lhe cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri;\u2014indeed, he appcaredto wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, was mucb weakened, and that eIasticity of spirit which had once so dislinguished him now seeined to hclve fled for ever. He was now as much cl lover of solltude and silence as Lord Rvthvcn; but much as he wifhed for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atheris;if he s0ught it amidst the rvins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it ln the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lhen suddenly turning rovnd, would sbow, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon hcr lips. He determined to fly scenes, every featurc of which created such bitterassociations jn hls mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken af bim during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. Tbey travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robber\u017f, but they gradualIy began t0 slight tbesc reportf, which they imagined werc anly the jnvcntion of individuaIs, whose intcrest it was to excltetbe generofity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled wilhonly a few guords, more to serve as guides thari as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom 0f wbich was the bed af a torrent, with large massos of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they bad reason to repent their negligenee; for scarcelywero the wbole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, whon they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guris. In an instant their guards had 1eft them, and, placing themselves hehind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction wherice the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, irnitating their example, retired for o moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: butashamed of bejng thus detained by a foe, who with lnsulting shovts badc them advan ce, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers shovld climb a6ove and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in \u017fearch of the enemy. Hardly had they losl the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shovlder, which brought him lo the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heeding lhe contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by soeing the robbers' faces arourid him\u2014his guclrds having, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, immediately thrown up thejr arms and surrendercd.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon jnduced them to convey his wounded sriend to a neighbouring cabiri; clnd having agreod upon a ransom, he was no more dlstvrbed by their preserice\u2014they being eontent merely to guard the entrance till their c0mrade should return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveri's strength rapidly decreased; in two dayf inortificatlon ensued, and death seemed advanclrig with hasty step\u017f. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had 6een 0f the objects about him: but towards the close of thc last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, clnd his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may saveme\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of tbe passing day; but you moy save my honour, yovr srjend's hanour.\"\u2014\"How? lelI me how? I would d0 any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot exploin tho who1e\u2014but if you would conccal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world'f mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown far some time jn England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but ljfe.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultont violence, \"Swear by all your foul reveres, by all your nature fears, sweor that, for a year and cl day you will not i mpart your knowledge of my crimes or death toany living being jn any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyef seemed burstirig from their sockots: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acqu-\nalntance wjth this man rose upon his mlnd, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivoring cclme over him, cls lf from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the mornjng, he was about to enter lhe hovel in whioh he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that jt was no longer there, having beon conveyed by bimself arid comrados, upan his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbovring mount, according lo a promife thcy had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray os the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astoriished, and taking several of tbe meri, determined to go and bury jt upon the spot wbore it lay. But, when he had mounted to tho summit he fovnd no traco of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on which thcy had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last retumed, convinced lhat they had buried the corpse for thc sake af the cl0lhes.\nWeary of a c0untry in which he had met with such terrible misf0rtunes, and in which all apparently conspired to beighten that superstitious molancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved t0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waitjng for a vessol to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging thoso offects he had with him helonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there wcls a case containjng feveral wcapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the viotim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Wh ilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dag ger djscovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he fourid the weapori, and his horror mcly be lmagined when he discovered that jt fitted, thaugh peculiarly fhaped, the sheath he held iri his hand. His eyes scemed to need no further certainly\u2014theyseemod gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished ta di\u017fbelieve; but the particulor form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alikc in splendour on both, and left no room far doubt; there were also drops of b lood on each.\nHo left Smyrna, and on hls way home, at Rome, his fjrst inquirie\u017f were concernirig the lady he had attempted to snatch froin Lord Ruthven's sedvctive arts. Her pclrents werc in distre\u017fs, their fartunc ruined, and she had not been heard of fince the departure of hls lordship. Aubrey's mind became a1mosl broken under so many repeated horr0rs; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the de\u017ftrayer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and hlsonly occupation cansisted in vrging thespeed of the postilions, as if he weregoing to save the life os some one he hold dear. He arrived at Calcli\u017f; a breeze, wbich seemed obedient to his wlll, soan wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of hlf fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of lhe past. If shebefore, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the womari began lo appear, she was still more att-\naching as o companjon.\nMiss Aubrey had n0t that winning grace wbich goins tbe gaze and a pplause of the drawing-room assem6lies. There was norie of lhat light brilllancy whlcb only exis ts in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was nevor lit up by the 1evity ofthc mind beneath. There wos a melancholy charm about it which did riat seem to arise froin misfortune, but from sorne feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that ligbt footing, which strays where'er a butlerfly or a colovr may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When al0ne, her sace was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his afsection, arid wouId in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if tbose eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in tbe light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presenled to the world, it having been tbought by her guardians morefit that her presentcltiori should be delclyed until her brother's return from lhe conlirient, whcn he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drclwing-roam, whicb was fast clpproaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remajned in lhe mansiori of his falhers, and sed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could n0t feel interest ahout the frivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind hadbeen so torn by the events he had wilnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived iri town, and prepared for the next day, whjch had been announcod as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excefsive\u2014a drawing-room had not boen held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bosk in the smile of royalty, hastened thilher. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was st anding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engoged in lhe remembrance that the first tjmo he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014hefelt himself suddenly seized by the arrn, and a v0ice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spoctre that would blastbim, when he perceived, at a little dislance, the same figure which had clttracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into soeiety. He ga2ed till his limbf alinost refusing to bear tbeir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcjng a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into hiscarriage, and was drivcn home. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, and fixed his harids upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting fromhis brain. Lord Ruthven ogoin before him\u2014circuinstances started up in dreadfuI array\u2014the dagger\u2014bis oath.\u2014He roufed himself, ho could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had oonjured up the image his mind was refting upon. It was impossible that it co uld be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for lhough he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upori his lips, and hecovld not succeed in gaining informatiori. He went a few nigbls aster with his sisler to the assembly of o near relation. Leaving her under lhe protection of a rnatron, he retired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he roused hirnscls, and entering another room, found his \u017flster surroundod by several, apparently in earnest conversaliori; he ottempled to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requc\u017fted to move, turned round, and revealed to him thosc features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized hif sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towclrdf the street: at tho door he sound himself impeded by the crowd of servonts wh0 were waiting for their lordf; and while he wos engaged in passing tbem, he again heard that voice whifper cl0se to him\u2014\"Remcmber your oath!\"\u2014Hc did not dare loturn, but, hurryinghis sister, soon reached hame.\nAubrey became almosl distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subie ct,how much more completely was it engrossed, now that lhe eertainty os the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attenlions were now unhecded, and it was in vain that sheintreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered cl few words, and those terrified her. The more he th0ught, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he theri to clllow this monstcr to r0am, boaring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by bim. But even if he were to hreak his oath, and disclose hjs sufpicions, whowould bel leve him? He th0ught of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretcb; but death, he remembered, had been aIready mocked. For days he remclined in lbis state; shut up in his room, he sawna one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no langer capable of bearing sti1lness and solitude, he lest his house, roamcd from street to street, anxious t0 fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wclndered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; clt first he returned with the evening to the house; but at 1ast he laid him down lo rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, clnxious for his sasety, employed people to follow him; hut they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with tbe idea that hc left by his clbsenee the whoIe of his frierids, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence theywere uriconscious, he detcrmined to enler again into s0cicty, and watch him clofely, anxiouf lo forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approachod with jntimacy. But when be enteredinto a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so strlking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last o6liged to beg of him to abstain froin seeking, for her sake, a s0ciety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing thclt his mjnd was becoming alienated,they thovght it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thcm by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he bad daily encountered inhis wanderings, and of preventlngbim from exposing to the general eye those marks of wbat they considered folly, they cngaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant core of him. He hardly oppeared to notiee it, \u017fo completely wcls his mind ab\u017forbed by one terrible su6ject. His inooherence became at last so great, thal he was confined lo his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had hecome emaciated, his eyes had attairied a glassylustre;\u2014the only sign of afsection and recollectjon remaining displayed itself upon the eritryof his sist er; then he would sometimes \u017ftart, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not lo touch him. \"Oh, do not touob hlm\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near hlm!\" Wben, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his anlyanswer was, \"True! true!\" and agairi he sarik into a state, whence not even she could rouse hlm. Thif lasted many months: grcldually, however, as the year was passing, his iricaherences became less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a portion ofjts gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he w0uld eount upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tlme had nearly elapsed, when, upontbe last day of the year, one of his guardians eriteririg his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melaneholy circumstonce of Aubrey's being in so awful a situatjon, when hjs sister was going riext day to be married. Ins tantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glod os this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, lhey mentioned the name of the EclrI of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met wilh in society, Aubrey seemed pleclsed, ond astonished them still more by his expressing his intention ta be prcsent at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparentIy again capable os being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his brcast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once rnore alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so diftlriguished far rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprlse at beh0ldlrig the features of tbe monstor who had so long iriflucnced his life. He seized the portroit in a paroxysm of ragc, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thvs destroyed the rosemblancc of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frontic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014jt seemed as if that voice again bade him reinernber his oalh\u2014he turned sudderily round, thinklng Lord Ruthven wa\u017f near him bul saw no one. In the meanlime the guardians and phy\u017fician, who had heard the wholo, and thought this was but a return ofhis disorder, entered, and foroing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he iinpl0red, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this lo lhe insanity thoy imagined hod taken pofsession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with evcry one el\u017fe. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily uriderslaod himself to be lhe causc of it; but wheri he leamed that he was deemed insanc, his exultatlon and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the houso of his former companion, and, by oonstant attendance, and tbe pretence of great affectionfor the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear 0f Miss Aubrey. Wha cou1d resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils lo recount\u2014could speak of him self as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the orowded earth, save with her to whoin he addre\u017fsed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existenee, hcld begun to seem worthy of preservation, if jt wcre merely that he might listen to her soothing clcoentf;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use thc serpent'f art, or such was the will of fate, that be gained her affections. The litle of the elder branch falling atlength to hirn, he obtained an jmportant embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening tho marriage, (jn spite of her brother's deranged stale,) which was to lake place the very day bofore his departure for the continent.\nAu6rey, when he was left by the physician and bis gvardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was givcn hlm; he wrote o letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the horiour of those now in the grave, who once held her iri their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a sew hours that marriago, 0n which be denounced the most heavy curses. Tho servants promised lhey would deliver it; but giving it to lhe physician, be thought it better not t0 harass any more the mind of MissAuhrey by, what he considered, the rovings 0f o maniac. Night passed on without rost to the busy inmates of the house; and Au6rey board, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, lhe riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound ofcarrjages broke uponbis ear. Aubrey grew alm0st frantic. The cvriosity of the servants clt last overcame their vigilancc, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the eust0dy os an help1ess old waman. He seized thc opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in o momerit found himself in the apartment where all wero nearly as\u017fembled. Lord Rvthven was the first to perceive him: he immedjately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispercd in his ear\u2014\"Remembcr your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, be pushed him towards his attendants, who, rousedby the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had brokeri a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bod. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present whori he entered, as the physieian waf afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increclsed; the effusiori of blood produced symptoms of lhe ncar opproach of death. He desired his fister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; bul when they arrjved, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all befare him, where to choose his place ofrest, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian ArchipeIago, on board one of bis Mojesty's vessel\u017f, in tho year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, iri the island af that name. Tbe beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014bothmen of war ond merchantmen; and though il lics rath er out of the trock for sbips bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyago. We londed; as usual, at the bottom of the 6ay, and whilst the men were employcd in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattIe with the natives, the clergyman and myself look a ramhle to the cave caIled Homer's School, and other ploces, where we had been before. On tbe brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met witb and engaged a young Grcek a\u017f aur guide, wbo told us he hadcome from Scio with an English lord, who left the islond four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"arid would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylenc, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, hut a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, helorigs lo hiin, and he has left an old man in charge of lt: he gave Dominick, the wine-tr ader, six hundred 2echlnes for it, (abovt L250 Eriglishcurroncy,) and has resided there ab0ut fourteen monthf, though not constantly; for he sails in his selucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excjted ovr curiosity very much, and we lost no tiine in hastening to the house where our countryman had resi ded. Wo were kindly recejved by an o1d man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of sour apartmonts on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, cl drawing-rooin, a sitling parlour, and a bed-room, with cl spacious closet annexed. They woro all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on eitber s ide, a lar ge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which covld be made ta play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe sidc of a small bronze Venus in a leaning paslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furnilurc. In the hall stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no inirrors, n0r a single painting. The bedchamber had mercly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilIow\u2014the common bed throvghout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the o1d mcln told us, filled witb books and papers,which were then in a large scaman's chesl in the closet: it was operi, but we did not thjnk ourselvos justified in examining the contents. On tbe tablet of the recesf lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, iri the German Ianguoge; Klopstook's Mefsiah; Kolzebue's riovels; Scbiller's play of the Robberf; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphlets frorn the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most af these books were filled with marginal notes, writteri with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old mari said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiirig 6efore he sajled, and forgat to place them with tbe others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unlil his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without ordcrs, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very gaod. I once did him a service; and I hove lhe producc of this farm for the trouble of lakirig care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in asmall cottagein lhe wood, and whom the Iord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanoe of thc house cxternally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marhle pillars with black pIinths and fret-work cornices, (as itis now customary in Grecian architecturo,) were considerably higher than the roof. Tbe roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a firie Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of str0ng coarse linen. Most os the houso-tops are tbus furnisbed, as upon them the Greeks passtheir everiings in smoklng, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi,\" eating fruit, anderijoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streomlet glided away, grapes, orclnges and ljmos wero clvslcring together on its borders, and under tbe shade of two large myrtle bvshes, cl marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord pasfed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talkjng lo himseIf. \"I suppose,\" said tbe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"arid always attended our church twi ce a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this \u017feat was what may bc termed \"a bird's-eyeview.\" A line of rieh vineyards led lhe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam lssuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was losl in lhe woodsnear the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadawed by a single cloud, terminatesthe uiew in front; and a little ori the left, through a vlsta of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wove with spols of emerald greeri. I seldoin enjoyod a uiew inore than I did thif; but our enquiries were frultles\u017f as to tbe name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his bankcr, who bad gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armcnian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, 6utI am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cann0t you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I ean,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit lhe Armenicln, but on our return to the town we leclrnt several particulars of the isolated lo rd. He had portioned eigbt young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, ho rscs to others, and cotton and silk to lhe girls who live by wcaving these articles. He also h0ught a new boat for a fisherman who had loft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to thc poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old frierid at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a mosl beautiful daughter, with whom thc lord was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and hc hcld bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inf0rmation with which we deparled from the peaceful islo of Mitylene; our iinaginotions all on the rack, guessing who this ramblcr ln Greece oould be. He had money it was evident: he hod philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculior geniuf. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who hcld been trave1ling in Egypt and Greeco, \"Thc individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxi0us, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trclvels on thei\u017flarid of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame,as we had been some years from home; but \"Chjlde Harolde\" being put into our hands we reoognized the recluse of Calc1a in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottoge, but wc consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me lhat day will never rcturn. I make this statemenl, believlng it nol quile uninteresting, and iri justice to his lordship's good narno, whlch has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an urifeeling disposjtion, averse to associatirig with buman nature, or contributing in any way to sooth lts sorrowf, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reversc, as mayhe plajnly gathored from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings os the heart, so elegantly depictod in his lordship's poems, seem to have lheir seat in his bo\u017forn. Tenderness, fympclthy, and ehclrity appoar to guide all his octions: and his courting tho repo\u017fe of solitudeis an additional reason far rnarking hiin as a beirig on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevalericehath thrown hermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryrnan. Wilh respecl to his loues 0r pleasures,I do riot assvme a right to give an opinion. Reports are over to be received with caution, particularly when direcled against man's morol integrity; and he who dares justify himself hefore that awfuI tribunal wbere all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good ln seoret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testjmony 0f a virtuous heart and felf-approving c0nscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crowri-oovrt, Fleet-street.","7":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidorl\nTHE svperstition upon which this tole is founded is very general in lhe East. Among the Arabiaris it appears to be cammon: it did ri0t, howcver, extend itself to tbe Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed itf present form fince the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, lhat a Latin body could not corrupt ifburied in thoir torritory, il gradually increa\u017fed, and formed the subject of many wondersul stories, still extant, 0f tbe dead ris ing from their graves, and secding upon the 6lood of tho young and beautiful. In the West it \u017fpread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existcd, that vampyros nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who beeame emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily dled os consumptions; whiIst thefe human blood-suekers fattened\u2014and their veins beoame distended lo such a state of repletion, as to cause the bload to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores af lheir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accounl of a particular casc of vampyrism, which if stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appeclrs, that upon an examination of the commander-in-cbief and magistrates of the place, they positluely and unanimously affirmed, that, about fiue years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of lhe Turkish Servia, ho had been torinented by a vampyre, but had sound a way lo rid hjmself of the evil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyro's grave, and rubbing himself with hif bl0od. This precauli0n, however, did not prevent him frorn becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death clnd burial, many persons complained of having been tarmented by him, and cl deposition wos made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attocks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted thejr Hadagni, took up the body, ond found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh,and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praof having been tbus obtained, they resarted lo lhe accustomed remedy. A \u017ftake was driven entirely through the hearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he if reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were odoptod with the corses of those persoris who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon olhers who svrvived lhem.\nThe universal be lief is, that a porson sucked 6ya vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his lvm.\nCbief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rod0montade is here reIated, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject af the present observations than any other instarice which could be adduced. In many p arts of Greece it i\u017f considered as cl sort os punishment after death, for some heinous erime commitled whilst in existence, that thc deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compolled to confine his infernol visitatioris salely to those belngs heloved most whiIe upan earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindrcd and affection.\u2014Asuppositiori allvded to in the \"Giaovr.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy c0rse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghast1y haunt the native placo, And suek the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet whicb porforce Must seed thy livjd living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know tbe demori f0r their sire; As cvrsirig thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for lhy crime rnust fall, The youngest, best beloved of oll, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap lhy hearl in flamc! Yet thau must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014bcr eye's lclst spark, Aridthe last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'cr its lifolesf blue; Theri with unhaIl0wed hand shall tear The tresses of her ycllow hajr, Of which, jn life a lock when shorn Affection's fondost pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by lhoe Memorial of thi ne agoriy! Yet with tbirie own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, G0\u2014and with Goul\u017f and Afrits rave, Till these jn horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corso of the Arabian moid Oneiza, who is represented af having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best lovedwbilst in existon ce. But this cannot be \u017fupposod to have refulted from the sinfulness 0f her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraoious Tovrnefart giv es a long account in his travels of several oslonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of aneodotes, and tradltjonary narratives illvstrative of its effects, has put farth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to 6e a c1assical, as well a\u017f barbarian error.\nMany curious and intere\u017fting nolices on this singularly horrible supcrstition might be added; thovgh the presenl may suffice for the limits of o note, nccessorily devotcd lo explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, tbat th0ugh the term Vampyro is the one in most general acceptation, there are severa1 others synonymous with it, made use 0f in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that ln the midst of the dissipatioris attendant upon a London winter, lhere appeared at the variaus parties of the leaderf os the tori anobleman, more remarkable for his singularitles, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around hiin, as ifhe could not participate lherein. Appclrently, the light laughter of lhe fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts w here thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whonce it arose: sorno altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce lhrough to the iriward workirigs of the heart; but sell upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skin it could n0t pass. His peculiarities causod him to be invited to every hou\u017fe; oll wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were ploased at having somethirig in their presence eapable of engagjng their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whieh never goined a warmer tint, ejther fr0m the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its f0rm and 0utline were beautifu1, many of the female huriters aster notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery af every morister shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in hif way, arid did al1 but put on the dress of a mounlebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014wheri she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently sixed upon her's, stilI it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could nol influence even the guidance of hj\u017f eyes, it wos not that the female sex was indifferent lo him: yet svch was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocenl daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himseIf to females. He had, however, the reputationof a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular charaeter, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be waf as often among lhose females who form lhe boast of lhelr sex from their domestic virtues, as among those wh0 sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, th ere came t0 London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: ho was an orphan left with an only sisler in lbe possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his sortune, whilc they rclinquished thc morc important charge os bis rnind to lhe care os mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination thcln his iudgment. He had, hence, that higb romantic foeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to \u017fympathise with virtve, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that tho misery of a eottage merely corisisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adaptcd to tho palnter's eye by thejr irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in flne, that tbe dreams of poets were the realities of life. He wos handfome, frank, and rieh: forthese reasons, upon his cntering into the gay circle\u017f, many mothers surrounded him, \u017ftriving which should describe wjlh leclst trutb t heir languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the \u017fame time, by their brightcning countenances when he appraached, and by tbeir sparkllng cyes, wheri he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of hls talents and his merit.Attached as he was to thc romonce of his solitory hours, he was startled at finding, that, excepl iri the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a gbost, hut from want of snuffing, therc was no foundation ln real lifo for any os that congeries of plea\u017fing plctures and dcscriptions oontained in those volumes, from which he had formcd his study. Finding, howe-\nver, somo compensatiari in his gratified vanity, he wa\u017f aboul to rclinquish his dreams, when the extrclordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility os forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw ather signs of his observation of e xtomal objects, than the tacitassent to their existence, impIied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination ta picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon sormed this object into the heroof a romance, and detormined to ob\u017ferve theoffspring of his fanoy, rather than the person bofore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentioris, arid so fclr advanced upon his riotice, that his pre senco was always recogriised. He gradually 1earnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and \u017foon found, fram the notes of preparationin \u2014 Street, that he was abovt lo trauel. Desirous of gaining some information respectirig this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hirited to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many generotions has been thought necessary to enablo the young to take some rapid sleps ln the career 0f vice towards putti ng thoinselvos upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scanda1ouf intrigues are menlioned os the \u017fubjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying thern 0n. They consented: and Aubrey immodiately mentioning hjs intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him,wbo, apparontly, had nothing in comman with other men, be gladly accepted it, and in afew days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Au6rey had had rio opportunity of studying Lord Ruthveri's charactcr, and now he found, that, though rnany mare of his action\u017f were exposed to his view, the results offered differenl c0nclusioris from lhc apparent motives t0 his ooriduct. His c0mponion was profuse inhis liberality;\u2014the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, received srom his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wanls. But Aubrey cou1d not auoid remarking, that it was not up0n the virluous, redvced to indigence by the rnisfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bostowed his alms;\u2014thefe were sent from thedoor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profligale come to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper iri bis iniquity, hc was serit away wjth ricb charity. This was, however, attributed by hiin to the greater importunjty of the vicious, whicb generally provails 0ver the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thore was one oircumstarice about the charity of his Lordship, whieh was still more impressed upon hismind: aIl those upori whom lt was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffald, or sunk to thc lowest and the most abject misery. AtBrussels and other tawns through whioh they passed, Aubrcy was surpri2ed at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought sor the centres of aIl fashionable vice; there he entered into all tbe spirit of the faro table: he hetted, and always gamblcd with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then helost even more than he gclined; but it was alwayf with the same unchangingface, with which he gerieralIy watchedtbc society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or tbe luckless father of a numer0us family; tben his very wish seemed fortune's lclw\u2014this apparcrit abslractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes spa-\nrkled with more fire than tbat of the cat whilst dallying with the half-deod inouse. In every town, heleft the forrnerly affluent yauth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sato that had drawnhim withiri the reacb of lhis fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking look\u017f of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthirig of his late irnmense weaIth, wherewith to bvy even svfficient to fatisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the rui ner of mariy, the last gilder he had jv\u017ft snatched from tbe convulsive grasp of thc innocent: this mlght but be the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which wcls not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienccd. Avhrey often wished to rcpresent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and plea\u017fure which provedthe ruin of all, and did nol tend to his own profit;\u2014bul he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend wouId give him some opportunity os speaking frankly and openly to him; bawever, this never occurred. Lord Rutbveri in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyc spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratificatjori from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break tbat mystery, which to his exalted imaginalion bcgan to assume the appearance of somelhing supernalural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a tjmo lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily clttendance upon the morriing cirele of an Italian c ountess, whilst he went in search of the memorial\u017f of another almost deserted city. Whilst hewas thus engaged, letters arrived from England, wbich ho opened with eager impatienoe; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were srom his guclrdians, the latter astonished hjm; if it had before entercd into his imagination that there was an euil power resident in hls companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his lmmediately leauing hls friend, and urged, that hif choracter waf dreodfully vjcious, for that the possessioriof irresistible p0wers of seduction, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had beendiscovered, thclt his contempt far the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had requircd, to enhance hjs gratification, that his victim, the par tner of his guilt, should behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of tbeir virtue, hcld, sjnce his departure, thrown evon the mask asjde, and had not scrupled to expase thc whole deformity of their vices to the public gclze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjngle brigbt point on whlch to rest the eye. Ho resolved to invent \u017fome plausiblc pretexl for abandoning hjm altogether, purposirig, in the mean whi le, to watch birn rnore closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daugbter of the Iady whose bouse he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he wa\u017f thorefore obliged to carry on his pIan\u017f in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all bis wjndings, and soon discoucrcd that an clssignation had been appoinlod, which would most likely end in the ruin os an innoccnt, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered tbe apartmont of Lord Ruthven, and clbruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the fame time that he was awore of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered, that his intentions were such as he supp0sed a1l wovld have up0n svoh an occasion; and upon being prcssed whetber he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment be must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of thejr proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and ca1ling upon the mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not orily with regard to her daughter,but also concerning the oharacter of his Lordsbip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rutbven next day merely sent bis servant lo natify hif complete ossent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the PeninsuIa, soon found hlmself at Athens. He then fixod his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himsolf jn tracing the faded recards of ancient glory upon monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only bef ore slaves, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soi1 or many coloured 1ichon. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, fo beautiful and delicate,thclt she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dariced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain'\u017f side, one would have thougbt the gaze1le a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently tbe eye of ariimated naturc, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the laste of an epicure. Tbe light \u017ftep of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his searcb after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kclshrnore butterfly, show the whole beauty os her sorm, f1oating as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had juft dccyphoredupon an almost effaced tablet, in lhe contemplation of her sylph-like figvre. Often would her lresses fal1lng, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray suob delicately brilliant and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse lhe forgetsvlness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the vcry abiect he bad before lhovght of vitol importance ta the proper iriterprelation of a pas\u017fage in Pausonias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wishcd to preserue a memorial for his future hours, she wou1d sland by, and wotch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes os her native place; she would theri describe to him lhe circling dance upon the open plain, would point, to him in all the glowing colovrs of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembcred viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mjnd, would tell him all the supernatural tales os hernvrse. Her earnestness and apparent bellef of what she narrated, excited the interest evenof Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wbo had passed years amidsl his frionds, and dearest ties, f0rced every year, by foeding upon the life of a lavely semale to prolong bls existcnoe for the ensuing months, hi\u017f bload would run cold, whilst he ottempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found markcd witb the stamp of the fiend's clppetlte; and when she sound him so incredulavs, she begged of him to helieve her, for it had been, rcmarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proaf given, which obliged thern, with grief arid heartbreaking, lo corisess il was lrue. She detailed lo him the traditional appearance of these monsters, clnd his harror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate doscription of Lord Ruthven; he, however, stlll persisted in persuading ber, that there covld be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the rnany cojncidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her lnnocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women omong whom he had saught for his vision os romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducclted Greek girl, still he found himse lf more and more attached to the a1most fajry form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a p1an for some antiqvarian re\u017fearch,he would depart, determined not to retvrn until his object was attained; but be always found it jmpos\u017fib1e to fix bis attention upon the ruins around him, whllst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful posfessor of his lboughts. Ianlhe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frarik infantile being he had first knowri. Shc always feemed lo part fr0m him with reluctonce; but it was because she hcld no longer any ono with whom she eovld visit her favourite haunts, whilst her gvardian was occupied in sketching or uncoverjng some fragment whieh had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parerits on tho subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several p resent, affirmod their existence, pale with horror al lhe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determlned to proceed upon ono of his exeursioris, which was to detain hirn for a few hours; whon they heard tbe name of the place, they all at once begged of him nol to return al night, as he must necessarily pa\u017fs thraugh a woo d, where no Greek would ever remairi, after the day had elosed, upon any consideration. Tbey described it as the resort 0f the vampyres in their riocturnal orgies, and denounced the most beavy evils as impending upon hlin who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representotions, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw tbem shudder at his darlng thus to mock a \u017fuperlor, irifernal power, lhe veryname of which apparently inade their blood freeze, he was silont.\nNext m0rning Auhrey sel off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the me1aricholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrib1e fiends, had inspired them with suchterror. When he was abovt to deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night ollowed the power of theso bcings to be put in action;\u2014he prornised.He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he dld not perceivo that day-light would soon end, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gclther into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage vpon the devoted country.\u2014He at lclst, howevcr, mounted his horse, deterinjned to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in those southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, nlght begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014it\u017f echoing thunders had scaroely ari inlerval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his uery feet. Svddenly hishorso took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through lhe enlclngled forost. The animal at last, through fatigve, stopped, and he found, by the glclre os lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardIy lifteditse1f up from lhe masses of dead leaves andbrushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some orie to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he opproached, the thunders, for amoment silcnt, allowed him t0 hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stif1ed, exultant mockery of a laugh, continved in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he wasstartled: but, roused by tbe thunder which again rolled over his head, he, wjth a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknes\u017f: the sound, however, guided him. He was app-\narently unperccived; for, tbough he caIled, still the sourids continued, and no notlce was laken of him. He found himself in eontact with somc one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himfelf grappled hy one who\u017fe strength seemed svperbuman: determined to sell his life as dearly af he could, he struggled; butit was in vain: he was Iifted srom his feet and hurlod with enorrnovs force agaln\u017ft the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, andkneeIing upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare 0f mclny torches penetratlng thr0ugh the hole that gave light jn the day, disturbed hjm;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving hls prey, rvshed through the door, and in a moment the crashirig of the branche\u017f, as he broke through lhe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They onlered; the light of their torches fell upon thc mud walls, and the thatcb loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the defire of Aubrey they searched for her who bad altracted bim by her cries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but what was his horror,when the light 0f tbe torchef once more burst upon him, to peroeive the airy f0rm of his falr conductress brought ln a lifel ess corse. He shut his eyes, hoping tbat it was bvt a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, wheri he unclosed thern, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cbeek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as atlaching as the life that onee dwelt thore:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon hcr throat were tbe marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this tbe men pointed, crying, siinultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf 1aid by the side of her who had lately boeri to him lhe object of so many bright and fairy vlsions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his lhoughts werc\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to \u017fhun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost vnconsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a partieular construction, which had been f0und ln the hut. They were soon met by difforent parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamenlable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the porents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe tbeir grief would be impossible; but wheri they afcertained the cause of their child's dealh, they looked al Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsoIable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violerit feuer, and was often delirious; in these intervals he wouldcall upon Lord Ruthven arid upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg os his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. Al other tirnes he would im precale maledictions upon hi\u017f bead, and curse hiin as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately plaeed himself ln the samc hovse, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified andstarlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with thatof a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words,implyjng a lmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separotiori, and still more by the attention, arixiety, and care which he showed, soon recoriciled him ta his presence.His lordship seemcd qujte changed; ho no longer appcared that apathetic bejng who had so astonished Auhroy; but as soon as hif convalescence began to berapid, he again gradua1ly retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived no differencc from theformer man, except that al times he was surprised to mcet bis gaze fixed inte ntly upon him, with asmile of malici0us exultatjon playirig upon his lips: he knew nat why, but this smile haunlcd him. Durlng the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clpparontIy engaged iri wotching the tideless waves raised by the oooling brecze, or in markingthe progress of those orbs, circling, like our wor1d, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish ta avojd the eyef of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seomed to have fled f0r ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as be wished for folitude, his mind covld not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sougbt it amidst the ruins he bad forme rly frequented, Iclnthe's form stood by his \u017fide\u2014is he sought it iri the woods, her light step would appear wanderingamidsl the underwood, in quest 0f lhe m0dest violet; tben suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a rneek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of whlch created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to wbom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his iIlness, that they should visit tbose partsof Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every diroclion, and sovght every spot to whieh a recolleetjon cov1d be attached: 6ut thovgh they thu\u017f hastened frorn place ta plaoe, yet they seemed notto heed whal lhey gazed upon. They heard muchof robbers, but they grcldually began to slight these reports, whicb they imagined were only the jnvenllon of individuals, whose interesl it was to excite tbe generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequenee of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabilants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, m0re to serve as guides lhan as a defenoe. Uponentering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bedof a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent thelr negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pas\u017f, when they were ftortled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of seueral guns. Iri an instclnt their guards had left them, and, pIclcing themselves behindrocks, had begun to flre in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating th eir exomple, rctired for a mornent behind the sheltering turn of the defjle: but ashamed of 6eing thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shauts bade lhcm advance, and being expased to unresistlng slclvghter, is any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rvsb forward in seareh of the enemy. Hardly had thcy lost the shelter of the r0ck, when Lord Ruthven recolved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to hi\u017f assistance; and, no longer heeding the c0ntest or his own peril, was so0n surpriscd by seeing the robbers' faces around hlm\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, jmmediately thrown up their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey foon induced them to convey hif wounded friend to a neighb0uring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more distur6ed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrancc till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for wbich he had an arder. Lord Ruthven's strength rapldly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain af he had been of the o6jects about him: bul towards lhe close of the last evenirig, his inirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who waf induced to offer his assistance wilh more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heedthe death of my existence as little asthat of lhe passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I ncod bvt little\u2014my Iife ebbs apace\u2014I cannol explain the whole\u2014but jf you would conceal all y0u kriow of me, rny honour were free from stain in the world's moulh\u2014and if my death were unknown for s0me time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" criod the dying mon, raisjng himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul revere\u017f, by all your natvre fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not imparl your knowledgc of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whateuer moy happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014Hjs eyes seemed hursting from their sockets: \"I sweclr!\" said Avbrey; he furik laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to re\u017ft, but did not sleep; the rnany circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose vpon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold \u017fhivering came over him, as if srom the presentimenl of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to enter the hovcl in which he had 1est the corpse, when a robbcr mel him, and insormed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by hirnself and comrades, up0n his retiring, to the pirinacle of a noighbouring mourit, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed lo the first cold ray of the moon thot rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking severcll of the mcn, determined to go and bury it upon tho spot where it lay. But, when he had rnounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clotbes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on whicb lhey had laid lhe body. For a time hls mind was hewildered in conjectures, hut he at last returned, convinced tbatthey had buried the corpse for the sake 0f the clotbes.\nWeary of a oountry in which he bad met with sueh terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all apparently consplred to heighten thot superstitious melancholy that had sei2ed upon his inind, he resolved t0 leave it, and soon arrivcd at Smyrna. While wclitlng for a vessel to convey him lo Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those esfects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst otber things there was a case contairiing seueral weaponf of offence, more or less adapted ta ensuro tbe death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghanf. Whilst tuming them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samestyle as the dagger discouered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain furthor proof, he fovnd the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovercd tbat it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eycs seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gozing to be bound to the dagger; yet still be wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haftand sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also dropf of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inqulries werc concerning the lady he bad attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthveri's scductive arts. Hor parents were in dlstress, lheir fartune ruined, and she had not been heord of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's rnind became almost broken under so many repeated harrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a viclim to thc destroyer 0f Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and bis only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as lf he were going to save the lifc os some one he held dear. He arrivcd at Calais; a breeze, w hicb seemed obedient to his wiIl, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father\u017f, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to 1oso, in the embraoes and caresses of his \u017fister, all memory of the past. If she bef0re, by her infantine caresses, had gained his afsection, now that the woman began ta appear, she was still more attaching cls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thal winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was nono of that light brilliancy whieh onIy exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue oye was never lit up by tbe levity of tbe mind beneath. There was a melancboly charm ahout it which did not scem to arise from mjsfortune, but from some fceling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not thal light footing, wbich strayf wbere'er a butterfIy or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and perisive. When olone, her face was never brjghteried by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014lhat face were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians moro fit that her pre\u017fentation should be deloyed until her brother's return from the cantinent, wheri he might be her protector. It was now, lherefore, resolued thot tbe next drawing-room, wbich was fast approaching, should be lbe epoch of her cntry into tbe \"busy scenc.\" Aubrey would rather havo remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melaricholy wbich overpawered bim. He could not feel interest about the frivalities of fashionable strangers, when his mirid hadbeen sa torn by the evenls he hod witnossed; but he determined to soeriflce his own comfort lo the protecti0n of his sister. They soon arrived in town, arid prepared sor tbe noxt doy, whicb had been announeed as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessiue\u2014a drclwirig-room had not been held for a long tirne, and all who were onxious to bask in the smjIe of royalty, hastened thither. Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himsolf, hoedless of all around him, engclged in the remem brance that the fir\u017ft time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized t0o well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your 0ath.\" He had hardly eourage to tvrn, feclrful of seelng a spectre thclt would blast him, when he perceivod, at a little distance, thc same figure which had attracted his notice on this spol upon his first entry into society. He gazed lill his lirnbs alm0st refusing to bear lbeir weight, hc was obliged to lake the arm of a fricnd, and forcing apassoge throvgh the crowd, he tbrew him\u017felf inlo his carriage, and was driven hame. He paced the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid bis thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circurnstances started up in dreadsul array\u2014the dagger\u2014bis oath.\u2014He roused him-\nself, he cou1d nal believe it p ossible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind wos resting upon. It was impossiblo that it could be real\u2014he determjned, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his ljps, and he could not succeed jn gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near rclation. Leaving her under the proteotion of a matron, he relired into a rece\u017fs, arid there gave himself up to his own dovauring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he raused hirnself, and entering another room, foundhis sister surrovnded by several, apparently in earnest conversalion; he attempted to pass clnd get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most a6horred. Hc sprang forward, seized his sister'\u017f arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he fovnd himself impeded by the crowd as servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying hls sister, soori reached home.\nAubrey becclme almost distracted. If besore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complotely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the mon\u017fter's living again presfed upon his thoughts. Hissister's attentions were riow unheeded, and it wa\u017f in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttercd cl few words, and those terrified ber. The moro he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow thi\u017f morister to raam, bearing rvin upon his breath, amidst all he held deor, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by bim. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose hi\u017f suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of empl0ying his own hand to free lhe world from sueh a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his roam, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sclke, to \u017fvpport nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillnessand solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that imago which haunted him. Hls dress became neglec ted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He was no loriger lo he recognized; at sirst he returned with the evening to the house; but al last he laid him down to rest wherever fcltigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, einployed people to follow him; but they wore soon distaneed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter thcln any\u2014from thovght.His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into s0ciety, and watch him closely, anxiouf to forewarn, ln spite of his oath, all wborn Lord Ruthven approachod with intimacy. But when he entered lnto a room, hls hclggard and suspicious looks were so strikirig, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was al last obliged ta beg of him to abstclin srom seeking, for her sake, a sociely which afsected him fo strongly. When, bowever, remonstrance proved unavailing, tbe guardians thought propcr to interpose, and, fearing lhat his mind was bocomirig alienated, they thought it high tiine to resumc again that truft whjch had been besore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the irijurie\u017f and sufferings he had daily oncovntered ln bi\u017f wanderings, and os preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks os what they considerod folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take oonslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible suhject. His incoherence became at last \u017fo great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wou1d ofton lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had atlained a glassy lustre;\u2014lhe onlysjgn of affcclion arid reoolleclion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that scverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do riot touch him\u2014if your love for me is clught, do not go near bim!\" When, however, she lnquired to whom he referred, his only answor was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a ftatc, whence not evcnshe could rouse bim. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became Iess frequent, and his mlnd threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, tbat severol tlmes in the day he wauld covnt upon his fin-\ngers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly olapsed, when, upon the last day of tbe year, one of his guardians enlering his room, bogari to converse with his physician upon the melancholy oircumstance of Aubrey's beirig in so awful o situation, when hif sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Avbrey's attenlian waf attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they fcared he had been deprlved, they mentioned the nameof the Earl af Marsden. Thinking thjs was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avbrey \u017feemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at lhe nuptials, and desiring to see his sistor. They answcred not, but in a few minules hi\u017f sister was with him. He was apparently again capable os being affected by the influence os her lovoly smi1e; for he pressed hcr to his breast, and ki\u017fsed her cheek, wet witb tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being 0nce more cllive to thc feelings of affection. He began to speak with all hls w0nted warmth, and to eangr atulate her upon her marriage with a perfon so distinguishod for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the inonster who had so long insluonced his life. He feized the porlrait in a paroxysm of rclge, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking himwhy he thus destroyed the resemblance of ber future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for be\u2014 But he could not advarice\u2014it seemed as if thot voice again bade him remember his oalh\u2014he turned sudden1y round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meclntime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thoughl this was but a return af his disordcr, entered, and forcing him fromMisf Aubrey, desired her t0 leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he hegged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they jinagined had laken possesfion of his mind, ondeavoured to pacify him, and retircd.\nLord Ruthven hadcalled the morning after the drawing-room, and hod heen refused with every one el\u017fe. When be heard of Aubrey's i1l health, he readily undcrstood hirnself lo be the cause of it; but when he leclrned that he was deemed insane, his exultalion and pleasure could hclrdly be conoealed srom those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former compclnion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection forthe brother and interest in his fate, he gradvally won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his pawer? His tongue had dangcrs and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himsolf af of an indlvidual having no sympathy with any heirig on the crowded earth, \u017fave with her to whom he addresscd himself;\u2014cauld teIl how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of pre\u017fervation, if it weremerely thot he might listen to her saotbing accents;\u2014jn fine, he knew sa well how to usethe serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, that he gained her asfections. Tbe litle of the elder hranch falling at length tohim, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriag e, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the coritinenl.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted t0 bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was givon him; he wrote a letter to his fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happjness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in thcir arms as their hope and the hope of thelr h ouse, to delay but for a few hours that marriclge, on which he denounced the inost heavy curses. The servants promised they would delivor it; but givlng it to the physician, be thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passod 0n without rest t0 thebusy inmates 0f tho house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily bc conceiued thari described, the notes of busy preparatian. Morriing came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants cll last overeame their uigjlance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tbe custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was ovt of the raoin, and in a moment fouridhimself in lhe apartmerit where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was lhe firsl to percoive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by sorce, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and kn0w, if not my brlde to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pusbed him towards bis attendants, who, roused by the oldwoman, had camo in search of him. Aubrey couId no longer support himself; his rage not findlng vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This waf not mentioned to his sisler, who was not present when he entcred, as lhe physician was afraid of agitating her. The morriage was solemnized, ond the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approacb of deoth. He desired his sisler's guardians might be called, and whcri the midnight hour had struck, he relaled oomposedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Mis\u017f Avbrey; bvt when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven hcld disappeared, and Aubrey's sifter had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to ch0ose his place of rest, andProvidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing tbrough the Grecian Archipelclgo, on board one of bis Majesty's vessels, in tbe year 1812, we put inlo tbe harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that naine. The beauty of thls p1ace, ond the certain supply of cattle and vegetables alwoys to be had there, inducemany Brilish vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war ond merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for shjps bound to Smyrna, ils bounties amply repay for the deviation ofa voyage. Wc landed; as usual, at the b0ttom of the bay, and whilst the meri were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the ncltives, the clergyman and myself took a ram6le t0 thccave called Homer's School, and other plaoes, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a smalI monti-\ncule s0 named) we met with and engaged a yourig Greek as our guide, wbo told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engoged me as a pil0t,\" said the Greek, \"and would havc taken me wlth him; but I djd not choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am 1ikely to get marricd. Hewas an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, faeing the river, belongs to him, and he has left ari old man in charge of il: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for il, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not eonstantly; sor he sails in his felucca very often to the different jslands.\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very mueh, arid we lost no timo in hastenlng to the house where ovr countryman had resided. We werokindly reccived by an old man, who condvcted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance ha1l, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, anda bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-slaincd walls, mclrble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountairi beneath, whioh could be made ta play through the branches by moving cl spring fixed ln the side of asmall bron2e Venus in a leanjng posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall slood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an cmpty book-case:there were n0 mirrorf, rior cl single painting. The hodchamber had merely a large mat tress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton qvllts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greeco. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and paperf, which were then in a large seaman's cbest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think aurselvos justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Sbakspeare'f, B0ileau's, and Rovsseau's w0rkf complele; VoIney's Ruiris os Empires; Ziminerman, in the German language; Klopslock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novel\u017f; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, anItaliari cditlan, prin ted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets froin the Greek press at Constantinople, mucb torn, 6ut no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itallan and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribhled all ouer, and ma rked with slips 0f paper, on which also were remarks.\nTbe old man said: \"Tbe lord had been reading these books the euening before he sailed, arid forgot to place them with tbe others; bvt,\" faid he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that were I to move 0ne thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is olherways very gaod. I once did him a service; ond I have the praduce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty 2echines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the 1ord broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for what rcason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleclsjng. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Greclan architeclure,) were considerably higher than lhe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, boneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, asupon them the Greeks pass their evenings in fmokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma cbristi,\" eating sruit, and enjoying the evening hroeze.\nOn the left band as we enlcred the housc, a fmall stroamlet glided awoy, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle 6ushes, a marble seat with an ornainental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, thc 1ord passed many of his cvenlri gs and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wrltjng, and talking to bimself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very deuout, \"arid always ottended our chvrch twice a week, bcsides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye lo Mount Calcla, covered with oliue and myrlle trecs jn bloom, and on the summit of which ari ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A srnall stream issuing frorn the ruins doseended in broken cascades, until il waslost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, arid an borizon unshadowed by a fingle cloud, tormjnates the view in fronl; and a little on tbe left, throvgh a vifto of lofty chesriut and palin-trees, several small islarids wore distinctly obferved, sludding the light blue wave with spots af emerald green. I soldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the namo of the pcrson whohad resided in this r0mantic solitude: none knew his naine but Domirilck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am fure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tiine to visit lheArmenian, but on 0ur return to the towri we lcornt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He hod portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with thcmat thenuptiol feast. He gclve a cow to one man, harses to others, ond cotton and silk to lhe girls who liveby woaving these artieles. He also bought a new boal for a fisherman who had lost bis own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the p0ar children. In short, he appeoredto us, from all we coIlected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One ciroumstance we leclrnt, which our old friend at the c0ttage tbought proper not to disclose. He had a most beauliful daughter, with whom the lord was oflen seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a plano-forte, and taught her himsclf the use of it.\nSuch was tbe information with whieh we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramhler in Greece could bc. He had money it wcls evident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and all lhose eccentricities which mark peeuliar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovbtswere dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travellirig in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about wbom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; Imet him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visiled him at Mitylene.\" We had never lhen heard of his lordship's fame, as we hod been some years frorn home; hut \"Childe Harolde\" beirig put into our hands wc recogriized tbe recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious iri our researches clt the cottage, but we c0n\u017faled ourfelves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day wiIl nevcr return. I make thjs statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been defcribed as os an unfeoling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributirig in anyway to sooth lts sorrows, or add lo its pleasures. The fact is direetly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered frorn these li tlle anecdotes. All the finer feelingf of the heclrt, so elogantly depicted iri his lordship's poems, seem to have thelr seat in his bosom. Tendorness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide oll hjs actions: and his courting the repase of solitude is an additional reason for rnarking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read tbe preceding plcasing \"traits\" without feeling pro ud of him as a cauntryman. Withrespect to his loves or plcasurcs, I do not assume o right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed ogainst man's moral integrity; and he wbo dares juftify himfelf before that owfvl triburialwhere all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-morlal. Lord Byron's characteris worthy os his genius. To d0 good in secrel, and shun the world's appIau\u017fe, is the furest testimony of a virtuous hoart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGi1let, Printer, Crown-court, Fleot-street.","8":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE fuperstition vpon which this tale is fovnded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to 6e common: it did not, however, oxtend itself to the Greeks until aster the establishment of Christianity; and it has anly assumed its present form since thc diuision of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, lhat a Latin bodycould not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increafod, arid formed tbe subject of many wondersul staries, still extant, of tho dead rjsing from their gravef, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, aIl ovor Hungary, Po1and, Austrla, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, thatvampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of lhe bl ood of their victims, who became cmaciated, lost their strengtb, arid speedily died of oansumptions; whilst these human blood-suckersfclttenod\u2014and their veins becamo distendcd to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to fl0w fr0rn all the passages of their bodies, and even from the vcrypores of thoir skins.\nIri the London Journal, of Mclrch, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account af a particular case af vampyrism, which is ftated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrales af the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of lhe Turki\u017fh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himselfof tho evil, by eating some of tho earth out of the vompyre's grave, and rubbing hjmself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevcnt him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, abovt twenty or thirty days after his death and buricll, many per\u017fons complained af having been tormented by him, arid a depositjon was made, that fovr pcrsons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To provent further inischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is svpposed to be usual iri cafes of vampyrism) sresb, clnd entirely free fromcorruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid bload. Proof having been thus obtained, tbey resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was d riven entire1y through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reportod to have cried out as drccldfully as if he had been alivc. This done, they cut off hishead, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses os those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survivod them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person suckedby a vampyre becomes a vampyre himseIf, and sucks in his tvrn.\nCbies bailiff.\nThis m0nstrous rodomon tade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of thepresent observations than any olher instance whi ch could be adduced. In many parts ofGreoce it is considered as a sort of punifhment after death, for some heinous crime committed whiIst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confjne his infernal visitations solely to those bejngs he lovcd most while upon eartb\u2014those to whom he was bound by tjes of kindred arid affection.\u2014A fupposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut fir\u017ft on oarth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of a1l thy race; There from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yel loathe the hanquet which perforce Must feed thy livid llving corse, Thy viotims, ere they yet expirc, Shall know the demon for lheir sire; As cursing thee, lhou cursing tbem, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The yourigest, best beloved of all, ShaIl bless thee with a father's nclme\u2014 Thal word shclll wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou muft end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tirige\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand sball tear The tres\u017fes of her yellow hair, 0f which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest plcdge was worn\u2014 But now is horne away by thee Memorial of thirie agony! Yel with thine own be\u017ft blood shall drip; Tby gnashing tooth, and hclg-\ngard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrlts ravc, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accur\u017fed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful paein of \"Tbalaba,\" the vclmpyre corse of the Arabian mclid Orieiza, wbo is represented as having roturned from the grave for lhe purp0se of tormenting him she 6est loved whilst in existence. But this oannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulncss of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole 0f the tale as a complete type of purity and inriocence. The veracious Taurnesort gives a 1ong account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in hjsgreat work upan thls subject, besides a variety 0f anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put farth some learnod di\u017fsertations, tending to prove it to be o olassical, as well as barbariari error.\nMany cvrious and interesting natices on thls singularly horrible superstition migbt be added; though thc present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necossorily devoted to explanatian, and which may now be coricluded by merely remarking, that th0ugh the term Vampyre is the one in mosl general acceptation, lhere are feveral others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucol0cha, Vardoulacha, G0ul, BrovcoI0ka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried that in the midst of the dissipations attcndant upon a Loridon winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemon, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attenlion, that he migbt by a look quell it, and throw fear int0 those breasts where thoughtlessncss reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whencc it arose: some attri6ulcd it to the dead grey oye, which, fixing vpon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance lo pierce through ta the inward workings of the heart; bvl feIl upon the cheek with o leaden ray that weigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculia ritles caused hiin to be invited lo every house; cll1 wished to see him, and those who had been aceustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable ofengaging their attention. In spite of the deadly huc of his face, which never gclined a warmer tint, eitber frorn the blufh of modesty, or from the strong emotion ofpassiori, though its form and outline were beautifuI, many of the female huntcrs after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some rnarks of wbat they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had 6een the mockery of every monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marriage, lhrew horself in hif way, and did alI but put on the dress of a mauntebarik, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were appclrently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014everi her unappalled impudencc was baffled, and shc left the fiold. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidarice of his eyc\u017f, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, h0wever, the reputatjon of a winning torigve; and whether il was that it even overcame lhe droad of his singular characler, or thot they wcre moved by his opparent hatred os vice, he was as osten among those females who forin the boast af their sex from their domestic virtues, as among tbose who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a yovng gentleman of the name of Avbrey: he was an orphari left with cln only sister jn the possession of grcatwealth, 6y parenls who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought il tbeir duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the eare of mercenary subalter ns, he cultjvated more his imagination tban his judgmont. He had, herice, thal high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He belicved all to sympathise wilh vlrtue, and thought that vice was lhrowri in by Provjdence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misory of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothe\u017f, whioh were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fino, that the dreams of poets were the realities af life. He was handsomo, frank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striulng which should describe with least truth tbeir languishing or romping favourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenances when he clpproached, and by their sporkling eyes, whcn he opened his lips, soon led him into fal\u017fo notions of his talents and his merit. Atlached as he wcls to the romance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, exoept in tbe tallow and wax candles that flickered, not fromthe presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatlon in real life f0r any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriplions contained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, ho was abovt to relinquisb his dreams, wben tbe extraordinary being we have above described, crossed hiin in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an jdea of thc character of cl man entire1y absorbed iri hiinself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avaidance of lheir c0ntact: allowing his imaginalion to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to exlravaganl ideas, he soon farmod this object into the hero of a romarice, and determined to obferve the offspring of his fancy, rather lhan the per\u017fon before him. He hecame aoquainled with him, paid him attentions, clnd so far advanced upon hif notlce, that his presonce was cllways recognised. He grodually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarra\u017fsed, and so0n found, from the riotes of preparatlon in \u2014 Stroet, that he was about to travel. Desjrous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he binted to hisguardians, that it was tiine for him to persorm the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary t0 enable the young to take some rapid steps iri lhe career of vice towards puttirig themseIves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appeor af if fallen from the \u017fkies, whenever fcandal0us intrigues are mentioned as the \u017fubjects of pleasantry or ofprai\u017fe, accordlng to lhe degree os skill shewn in carrying them 0n. Theyconsented: and Aubroy jmmediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive from him a proposol to join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other mon, he gladly accepted it, and in afew dayf they had passed the circ1ing walers.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportvnity of studying Lord Ruthveri's charocter, and now he fovnd, that, though many more of hif actions were cxposed to his view, lhe results offered different oonclusions from the apparent molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his libera1ity;\u2014the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from bis hand more than enovgh lo relieve their immediate wants. But Au6rey could not avoid remarking, that jt was not upon the virtuous,reduced to iridigence by the misfortunes attendont even upon virlue, lhat he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent srom the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but wben tho profligato came to ask something,not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him slill deoper in bis iniquity, he wcls sentaway with rich charlty. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunily of the vicious, which generally preuails over the retiring bafhsulness of the virtuous indigent. Therc was one circumstance aboul thc charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wbom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the 1owest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and olber towns through which they passed, Au6rey was surprized at the apparent eagerness wilh whjeh his oompanion soughl for lhe centr e\u017f of alI fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging facc, with which he generally walched tbe s0ciety around: itwas not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luokless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractednes\u017f of mind was laid a\u017fide, and his eyes spark1ed with m0rc fire than that 0f the cat wbilst dallying with lhe half-dead mouse. In every town, he left tho formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, tbe fate that hod drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhout a single farthing os his late immonse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satlsfy their present craving. Yet he took no money fr0m the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the rujner of many, tbe last gilder he had justsnatchcd from the convulsive grasp of theinnocent: this might but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capclble os coinbclting thecunning of lhe more experienced. Aubrey often wished to ropresent lhis to his friend, and beg him to re\u017fignthat chority and pleasure wbich proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed jt\u2014for eacb day he hoped bis friend would give him some opportunity os \u017fpeaking fra nkIy and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven iri his carriage, and amidst tbe various wild and rleh scenes of nalure, was always the sclme: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and though Avbrey was near the objoct of his curiosity, be obtained no grealor gratislcation from it than the conftant excitement of vainly wishjng to broak that my\u017ftery, which to his exalled jmagination began to assume tbe appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time la\u017ft sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendclnce upori the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he werit in search of the mernorlals of ariother almost deserted city. Whjlst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Engla nd, wbich he operiedwith eager impatience; the first waf from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if lt had bcfore entered into his imaginotjon that there was an evil power resident in bis companion, thefo seemed to give hlm svfficient reason for the belief. His gvardians inslstcd upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadsully vicious, for that the passe\u017fsion of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangeraus to sociely. Il had been discavered, that his contempt for the adultress had riot originated in hatred of her choracter; 6vt that hc hod required, to enhaneo hif gratlfication, that his victirn, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradotion: in fine, that all those fema1es whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had,finco his deparlure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrup led to expose the whole deformity0f their vices to the public gclze.\nAubrey determined upon leavirig one, whose characler bad not yel shown a single bright poirit on which lo rest the eye. He res0lved lo invent \u017fomc plausible prelext for a6andonlng hjm altogether, purposing, in the meon wbile, to watch him more closc1y, and to let na slight circumstclnces pass by unnoticed. He entered inlo the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeovouring to work upon the inexpcrienee os the daughter of the lady whose house hc chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; be was therefore obliged to earry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignati on had been clppoirited, which would most Iikely end in the ruin of an jnnoccnl, though thoughtless girl. Losing rio time, he entered lhe apartrnent of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions witb respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her thot very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were svch as he supposed all would havc upon such an occasion; and upon 6eing pressed whelher he jntended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a riote, to say, that fr0m that moment he must decline acoompanying his Lordship in the remainder af their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother af the lady, informed hor of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was preverited. Lord Ruthven noxt day meroly sent his servant ta notify his complete assent ta a separation; but dld not hinl ariy suspicion of his plans hclving beeri foiled by Au6rey's interposition.\nHaving lefl Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soori found himself at Athens. Ho tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soan occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slavef, had hidden themfelucs beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same raof as himself, existed a being, so beautifvl and delicate, that fhe might have formed the mode1 sor a painter wishlng to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet'\u017f paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could be1ong to those who had no souls. As shc danced upon the plain, or lripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelIe a poar type of her beauties; for who would have exchonged her eye, opparently the eye of animaled nature, f0r that sleepy luxurious 1ook of the animal suited but to the tasto of an epicuro. The light slep of Ianthc osten aecompanied Aubrey in his search after ontiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere 6utterfly, show the wh0le beauty of her form, floating as it were upon tbe wind, to lhe eager gaze of him, wbo forgot the letters he had just decyphercd uponan almost effaced tclblet, in the contemplatlon of her sylph-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhihit in the sun's ray such delicately brllliant and swiftly fading hues, it might wellexeuse the forgetfulness os the antiquary, who let escape from his inirid the very objecthe had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to descrjbe ehclrms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014Il was innocerice, youth, and beauty, vnaffected hy crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve cl memorial for his future h ours, she wovld stand by, and watch the magic efsects of bis pencil, in tracing the scenes of her nativc place; she would then describe to him tbe circIing danee upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all theglowing coIours of youthful memory, lhe m arriage p0mp sho remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turriing ta subjects that bad ovidently made o groater impression upon her mind, would tell him al1 the supernatural tales of her nurse. Hcr earnestncss and apparcnt bclief of wbat she narrated, excited the interest evenof Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wh0 had passed years amidsl his friendf, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the ljfe of a laveIy female to prolonghis existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attemptcd to laugh her out of sucb idle and horrihle santasies; but Ianthe cited to him tbe names af old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after \u017feveral of their near relalives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the siend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged thein, with griefand heartbreaking, lo confess it was true. Sho detailed to him the traditional appearance af tbese monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, h0wever, stiIl perfifted in persuading her, thclt there covld be no truth in her fears, though ot the \u017fame time he wondered at the many coincidences which had alI tended to excite a belief in the svpernatural power of Lord Rvthvcn.\nAubrey began to attacb himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virt-\nues of the women ainong wbom he had sought f0r his vision of romance, won his heart; and wbile he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an unedvcated Greek gjrI, still he found himself more and more attaohed to the almost fairy sorm before him. He would tear himself at times from her, arid, sorming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return unti1 his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to six his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst iri his mind he retained an image that seemed alono the rightful possefsor of histhoughls. Iclnthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the \u017fame frank infantile bcing he hod first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer ony one with whom she could visit her fauourite haunls, whllst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering \u017fome fragment whieh had yet escaped the destrvctive hand os time. She had appcaled to her parents on the svbjeot of Vampyres, and lhey both, with several present, affirmed their existencc, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey determined to proceed upan one of his excursions, which was to detain hlm for a few h0urs; when thoy heard the nclme os tbe place, thcy all at onee begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily po\u017fs tbrough a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had cIosed, upon any consideralion. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upori him who dclred to cross thejr path. Aubrey inade lighl of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; bul when he sow them shudder at hi\u017f daring thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, tbo very name of whjch apporeritly made their blood freeze, he was silenl.\nNext morning Aubrey set osf upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hls words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had insplred them with such terror. When he wasabout to depart, Ianthe came to the fide of his horse, ond earnestly beggcd of him to returri, ere night alIowed the power of these boings lo be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he dld not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spccks which, in the warrner climates, so rapidly galher into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upori the devotod country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horfe, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fets, night begins: and cre he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the eanopying faliage, whilst the blue forked lightnirig seomed to fall and radiate at his very seet. Suddenlyhls horfo took fright, and he was carried with dreadfuI ropidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the g1are of lightning, that he was in tbe neighbourhood of a hovel tbat hordly liftod itself up from tbe masses of dead leaves clnd brushwood which surrourided it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping ta find \u017fome one to guide him to tbe town, or at loast trusling to obtain she1ter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, allowed him t0hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman minglirig with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in ane almost unbroken sovnd;\u2014he wos start led: but, roused by the thunder which again roIled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the doar of the hut. He found himsels in utter darkne\u017fs: the sovnd, however, guided him. He was apparently unpcrceived; for, though he oalled, still the sounds continued, and no notioe was taken of him. He found himse1f ln conlact with some one, wbom he immedjately sejzed; when a v0ice crled, \"Aga in baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt hjmse1f grappled by one wh0se strength seemed superhvman: determined to sell his lifeas dearlya\u017f he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled wilh enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, had placed hishands upon his throat\u2014when the gloreof many torches penetrclting throvgh the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the bronches, as he brakethrough thc wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; ond Aubrey, incopable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the lighl of their torohes fell upori the mud walls,and the thatchloclded on cvery indivjdual straw wjth heavy flakes of \u017foot. At the desire of Aubrey they seclrched for her who had altract ed him by hor cries; he wcls again left in darkness; bvl whal was his horror, when the light of lhe torohes once more burst upori him, to perceivc the airy form of his fair conductress broughl in a lifeless cor\u017fo. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vifion arising from his disturbed imagiriation; but he agairi saw the same form, wheri he unclosedthem, strelched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, riot even upon her lip; yel there was a stillnes\u017f about ber face that seemed almost as attacbing as the lise that once dwelt there:\u2014upori her neek arid breast was blood, and upon hor throat were the marks of teeth having openod the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously strvek with borror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly sormed, clrid Aubrey was lclid by the slde of her wbo had lately been ta him tbe obieet of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life tbat had died within her. He knew n0t wbat hls thought\u017f werc\u2014his mind was benum6ed and seemed to shun roflection, and take r efuge in vacancy\u2014he held alinost unconsciously iri hjs hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, whicb had been found in the hvt. They were soon met by difserent parties who had been engaged jn the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lainentclblc cries, as they approachedthe city, forewarned the pclrenls of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe thelrgrief wovld 6e impossible; but when thcy ascortainedthe causo of thejr child's death, thoy looked at Aubrey, and pointed to tbe corse. They were inconsolabIe; botb died broken-bearted.\nAubrey being put to bod was seized with a most vlolont fever, and was often delirious; in thcse intervals he wauld call upon Lord Ruthuen and upon Iantbe\u2014by some unaccountable com6ination he seemed to beg of his former companiori to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upan his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthuen, chanced at this tlme to arrive ot Athens, and, from whatevcr motive, upon bearlng of tho state of Aubrey,immediately placcd himself in the same havse, and became his constant atleridant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now oombined with that of a Vainpyre; but Lard Rulhueri, by bls kind words, jmplying almost rcperitance for the favlt that had oaufed thoir separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whieh he showed, soon reconciled him to bis presence. His lordship seemed qulte ohclnged; he no loriger appeared that apathetic bcing who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began lo be rapid, be again gradually retired irito the same state of mind, and Avbrey perceived no difference from the former mcln, except that at times he was surprised to inecl his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he kriew not why, but this smile haunled him. During the last stage of the invalid'\u017f recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparent ly engaged in watchlng the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of lhose orbs, circllng, like our world, the moveless suri;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wifh to avoid the eyes of all.\nAuhrey's mind, by this shoek, was much weakened, arid lhat elasticity of spiril which had once so distingujshed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of soliludc and silence as Lord Ruthven; butmuch as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find lt in lhe neighbourhood of Athens; if he soughtil amidst the ruins ho had formcrly frequented, Ianthc's forin stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quesl of the modest violet; tben suddenly turning round, would s how, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bilter assaciations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbven, to whom he held himself bound by lhe tender care he had taken of him durlng his illriess, tbot they should visit lhose parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollecti0n couldbo atlached: but though they thus hastened fr0m place to place, yet they seemed not to hoed what they gazed upon. They heard rnuch of r0bbers, but they gradually began to sIight these rep0rts, which they imagined were onIy the inveriti0n of lndividuals, who\u017fe interest it was to excite the generosity of those wh0m they defended frorn pretendeddangers. In consequence of thus negIecting the advice of the inhabltants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, inore to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon cntering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a tarrent, with large masses of rock brought d0wn from the neigbbouring precipices, they had reafon to repent thejr negIigence; for scaroely were the whole of tbe party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to tbeir heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an inslant tbeir guards had left them, and, placingtbemselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report camc. Lord Ruthvon and Aubrey, imitating thoir example, relired for cl momenl behind the sheltering turn of lhe defile: but afhamed of being thus detainod by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unrosisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and toke them in the rear, they determined at 0nce to rush forward in search of tho cnomy. Hardly had they lost tbe shelter ofthe rock, wben Lord Ruthven recoived a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grovnd. Aubrey hastened to his assiftance; and, no longer heeding lhe contcstor his own poril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards havlrig, upon Lord Ruthven's being waunded, immediately throwri up thejr arms and furrendered.\nBy promises of grcat reward, Avbrey soan induced them to canvey his wounded friend to a neighbovring cabin; and having clgreed upon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their pre\u017fence\u2014they being content merely la guard the entrance till their comrade should return with tbe promised sum, far which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strerigth rapidly decreased; in two days mortificcllion ensued, arid death seemed advancirig with hasty steps. His oonduct and appoaranco had not changed; he seerned as unconsciaus of pain as he had been of the objocts about him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mind became apparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer his assistance wilh more lhan usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more thari that\u2014I mean not iny lise, I heed the death of my existence as little as thclt of tbe passing day; but yov may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do ariy thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I noed but little\u2014iny life ebbs apclce\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you wou1d conceal all you know os me, myhonour were frec from stain iri the world'\u017f mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown far some time in Englclnd\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"Il shall n0t be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying mcln, raising hlmse1f with exvltant vioIence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by oll your nature feclrs, fwear that, for a year arid a day you will not impart your knowledgo of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatover may hclppen, or whateuer you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed burstirig from their sockcts: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with thjs man rose upon hif mjnd, and be knew not why; when be remcmbered his oalh a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment os something horrible awaiting him. Rising e arly in tbe mornlng, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had lefl the corpse, when a robber met him,and informod him that it was no longer thero, hovirig been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mounl, according to a promise lhey had givcn his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first c0ld ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury il upon tbe spot where it lay. But, when he had movnted to the summit hc found na trace of either the corpse ortho clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identiccll rock on which they bad laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurried, convinced that they had buried the corpse for lbe sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country ln which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighteri that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he res0lved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting f0r a vessel to coriuey hiin to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those efsects be had with him belonging t0 Lord Ruthven. Amongst 0ther things thore was a case containing feveral weapons of offence, more or lcss adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, ond exclmining thelr curious forms, what was his surprisc at sinding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the sarne sty1e as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and hls horror may be imagined when he discovered tbat it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, tho sheath hc he1d iri his hond. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to bc bound to the dagger; yel still he wished lo disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on hls wcly homo, at Rome, bis first inquiries were concerning tbe lady he had attcrnpted to snatch from Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, thejr f0rlune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beeame almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that tbis Iady hadsallen a victim to the de\u017ftr0ycr of Ianthe.He became inorose and silent; and his only occupation consifted in urging the speed af the postllions, as if he were going to save the lise of some one he held deor. He arrivcd al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient lo his will, soori wafted him to the Eng1ish shores; and he hastened to lhe mansion os his fathers, arid there, for a momenl, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was stjll more attaching cls a oompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gainf thegaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was nono of that light hrilliancy which only exists ln the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye wasnever lit up by the leuity of the mind beneath. Tbere was a melancholy charm about it whjch did not seem to arise from misfortune, but srom some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfIy ora oolour may attrclct\u2014it wa\u017f sedate and pensive. Wheri alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forgel those griefs shc kncw deslroyed his rest, who would hclve exchanged hor smile for tbat of tbeuoluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014thot face were then playing in the llght of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat bcen presented to the world, it having bcen thought by her guardians more flt that her presentation should be delayed until her brather's returnfrom tbe contlnent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was sa\u017ft approaching, should be the epoch of ber e ntry into the \"busy fcene.\" Aub rey would ratherhave remained iri the mansion of his fathers, ond sed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not foel interest about the frivalitie\u017f of fashionable strangers, when hls mind had been so torn by the everits he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comsort to the protectiori of his sister. Tbey soon arrived iri town, and prepared for the noxt day, whlch had been announced as a drawing-room.\nTho crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been beld for a long time, and all wbo were onxious to bask in the smi1e os royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was flanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in thc remembrance that tbe first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly \u017feizcd by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, \u017founded iri his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a \u017fpectre thal would blast him, when he perceived, at o 1ittle distance, the same figure which had attracted his natice on this spot upon his first entry into society. Ho gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bcar their weight, he was obliged to take tbe arm of a friend, and forcing a pclssage lhrough the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paccd the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his bands upon his head, as if he were asrajd his tboughts were burstlng from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances s tarted up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He rouscd himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise agajn!\u2014He thought his iinaginatiori bad conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it eould be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though ho altempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the nome hung upori his lips, and hc couId not svcceed in gaining insormation. He went a few nights after with his sister lo tbc assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired jnto a recess, and there gave himself up to bis own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found hjs sister surrounded by seueral, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, wben one, whom he reque\u017fted to moue, turned round, and reveoled to him thofc features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifler's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the slreet: at tbe door he found himself impeded by the crowd af servants who were waiting for their lord\u017f; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard tbat voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reaehed home.\nAubrey bccaine almost distracted. Is before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much m0re c0mplctely was it engrossed, now that the certainly af the monster's living again presscd upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions wcre n0w unheeded, and it was in vain that \u017fhe intreatod him to explcliri to her what had caused his abrupt conduct.He only uttcred a few words, arid those tcrrified her. The inore he tboughl, the inore be was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this morister to roam, 6earirig ruin upon his b roalh, amidst all he heId dear, and not avert it\u017f progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath,and di\u017fclose his suspicjons, who would believe him? He thought of einploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been alreody mocked. For days he remairied in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one,and ate only when his fister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature.At last, no longer capable of bearing sti1lness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious lo fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wanderod, as often exposed to the no0n-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; bvt at last he laid him dawn la rc\u017ft wherever fatigueovertook him. His sjster, anxious for his fafety, empIoyed pe0ple to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from o pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thoughl. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his obsence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend omongst them, of whose presence they were unoonscious, he determined to enter again irito society, and watch him clos ely, anxious to forewarn, in spite os his ooth, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookf were so striking, hls inward shudderings so visible, thal his sister wos at last obIiged to beg of him to abstain from seekjng, for her fako, a socjety which affected him so strongly.When, however, remoristranee pr0ved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpo\u017fe, and, fearing thclt his mind was becoming alieriated, they thought it high tiine to resume again that trust wbich had been before imposed upon themby Aubrey'f parents.\nDesirous os faving him from the injuries clnd sufferings he had daily oncountered in his wandorings, and of preventing birn from exposing t0the general eye those marks of what they considered foIly, they engoged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of hlm. Hc hclrdly appeared to notice it, so comp1etely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that ho was confined to his chamber. Thcre he w0uld oftenlie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emacioted, his eyes had attained a glossy 1ustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself vpon the entry of hif sister; then he would sometimes start, and, selzing her hands, with looks that severely affIicted her, he w ould dcsire ber not lo toucb him. \"Ob, do not touch him\u2014if your 1ove for me is aught, do nol go riear him!\" When, howover, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answcrwas, \"True! true!\" and clgain he sank into a state, whence not even fhe could roufe him. Tbis lasted many monthf: gradualIy, however, a\u017f the year wos passing, his incoherences beoamc less frequent, and his mind threw osf a portionof ils glooin, whjlst his guardlansobserved, thal several times iri the day he would count upon his fingers a definite num6er, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians cntering his raom, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circuinstance of Aubrey's being ln so awfvl a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to be married.Instantly Aubrey's attention was atlracted; hc asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name af the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thjs wos a young Earl whom be had met with in society, Aubrey seeined pleased, and astonished lhem still more by his expressing hjs intention to he prefent at the nuplials, arid desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was witb him. He was apparcnt1y again capable of being affected by the influence of her lavely smile; for he pressed her to hjs breast, and kissed her cheek, wet witb toars, flowing at the thought of her brother's being orice more alive ta the feelings of affection. He began to speak wilh aIl his wonted warmlh, ond to congratulate hor upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rankand every a eoompljshrnent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what wos his surprjse al beholding the features os the monster who bad solong influenced his 1ife. He \u017feized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplod it under fool. Upon her asklng him why he thus destroyed tbercsemblance of her future hushand, he looked as is he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, clnd gazing on ber with a frantic exprcssion of countenance, he bade her swear thclt she would never wed this monstor, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the mearitime the guardiaris and physician,who had hoard the whole, and thought this was but o return os his disorder, entered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, de\u017fired her to leave him. He fell uponhis knees to them, he imp1ored,he begged of them to delay but forone day. They, attributlng this lo the insanity they imagined had taken possessiori of his mind, endeavovred to pacisy him, clnd retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-ro0m, and had been refused with every one else. Wben he heard of Aubrey's ill hoalth, he readily understood himself to be tbe cause of il; but when he lea-\nrned that he was deemed lnsane, his exultatiori and pIeosure could hardly be conceoled fram those am0ng whom he had gajried this information. He hasteried to tho housc of his former companion, and, by constanl attendance, and tbe pretcnce of great affeclion for tbe brother and interest in hisfate, hc gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to rocount\u2014could speak of himself as of on individual having no sympathy with any being on the crawded earth, save with her towhom he add ressed himself;\u2014oould tell how, since he knew her, his existence, hadbeguri to seem worthy of prcservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accenls;\u2014in flne, he knew sowell how to vse the ferpent's art, orsuch was the will af sate, that he gained her affections. The title of the eldor branch falling at length to hjm, he oblained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marrjage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continenl.\nAubrcy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, eonjuring her, as she valued herown happiness, herown honour, and the honour of those now in lhe grove, who onco held her in their arms as thelr hope arid tbe hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced thc most heavy curses. The servclnts promised thoy would deliver it; bul giving it lo the physician, he thought it bctter not to harass any more lhe mind of Miss Aubrey by, whot he consldered, tbe ravjngs os o maniac. Night passedon without resl to the busy jnmates of the hou\u017fe; and Aubreyheard, with o horror that mcly more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparotion. Morning came, and the sound of carriages br0ko vpon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantjc. The curiosity of the servants at last overoame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving himin the custady of an belpless old woman. Hc \u017feized the opporlunity, with one baund was oul of the room, and in a rnomcnt found himself in the aportment where all were riearIy assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, ond, taklng hls arm by force, hurried bim from the room, speechless wilh rage. Wheri on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered iri his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, arid knaw, if not my bride to day, your si\u017fter is dishonoured. Worneri arc frail!\" Sa saying, he pvshed him towards hjs attendants, who, roused by the old womon, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; hisrage riot finding venl, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed.This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not prescnt when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The mclrriage was salemnized, ond the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvbrey's weakriess increased; the effusionof blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desirod his sister's guardiaris might he calIed, and when the inidnight hour had strvck, herelated composedly what the reador has perused\u2014he died immediately afler.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too 1ate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared,and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEX TRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before hirn, where to choosc bis place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the G recian Archipclago, on board 0ne of hisMajesty's vessels, in the year 181z, we put into the harhour of Milylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, ond the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vefsels to visit it\u2014both rnen of war and merchantmen; arid though jt lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; af usual, at the bottom 0s the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walering, and the purser bargaining for cattle wllh the ncllives, the cIergymclnarid myself took a ramble to the cave called H0mer's School, arid other plaoes, where we had 6een before. On thc brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greek as our guide, who t0ld us he had come from Scio witb an Engllsh lord, who left lhe island four days prevlous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"clnd would bave taken me with him; bvt I did riol choose ta quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good rnan. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, andhe has left an old man incharge of it: he gaue Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided thero obout fourteen months, though not constantly; f0r he sails in his felvcca very often to the djfferent is1ands.\"\nThis aceount excited our ouriosity very much, and we lo\u017ft no tjme in hastenirig to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly rece ived by an oId man, wh0 conducted us over the monsion. It consjsted of sour apartments on the grourid-fIoor\u2014ari entrance hall, a drawing-roorn, o sitting parlour, and cl bed-room, with a spocious clofet annexed. They were aIl sirnply decorated: plairi green-stained waIls, marble tab1es ori either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fouritain beneath, which cauld be made to p1ay through the branchef by moving a spring fixed in the side of a sinaIl hronze Venus in a leaning poftvre; a large couch or sofa completed lhe furniture. In the hal1 stood hals cl dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The 6edchamber bad merely a large mattress spreod on thc fl oor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014lhe common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble reccss, sorinerly, the old man told us, filled with books and popers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the cl0sel: it was open, but we did not think oursclves justified in examinjng the contentf. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltclire's, Shakspeare's, BoiIeau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins os Empires; Zimmerman, in the Gcrman language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's nouels; Schjller's plcly os thc Robhers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editlon, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphletf from lhe Greek press at Conslantinople, much lorn, but no Eng1ish book of any doscription. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itallan and Latiri. The Mefslah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of pclper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The l0rd had been reading tbese books the evening before he sailed, clnd forgot to place them with thc others; bvt,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie until his retvrn; for he is so particular,that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; be isotherways very good. I once did him a service; and I bave the produce of this farm for the troubIe of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a smclll cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought hcre from Adrianople; I don't know for what roas0n.\"\nThc appearance of the house externcllly was pleasing. The partico in frorit wasfifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrourided by a lig ht \u017ftorie bcllustrade, was covered by a flne Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houso-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wlries, such cls \"laohryma christi,\" eoting fruit, and enjoying thc evening breeze.\nOn the lefl hand as we entered tho house, a small strcamlet gIided away, grapes, oranges and limef were clusteririg together on its borders, and vnder thc shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari arnamenta1 wooderi back was p1aced, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and night\u017f till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"Isuppose,\" said lhe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twiee a woek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seal was what maybe termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A lirie of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrt le trees in bloom, clnd on the summit of whioh ari ancienl Greek temple appoared iri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended ln broken ca\u017fcades, until jt was lost in lhe woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and ari horizon urishadowed by a slngle cloud, termincltes the view in frorit; and a little on tho left, through cl vista of lofty chesnut and polm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding tbe light blue wave with spot\u017f of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more thanI did thi\u017f; butour enquiries were fr uitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantlc solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wbo hod gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our c0nductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will nal,\"\u2014\"And canriot yov tell, old frie-\nnd?\" sclid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we leomt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when ho was last vpon lhe island, and evcn danccd with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to orie man, hor\u017fes to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who Iive byweaving thefe articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gaue Greek Testamcnts to the poor children. In \u017fhort, he appeared to us, from alI wo collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent cbaracter. One circuinstance we leamt, which 0ur old friend at the cottage lhoughl proper not to disclose. He hod a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was aften seen walking on the sea-fhore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inf0rmation with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; 0ur imaginationsall on the rac k, guessing who this rambler in Greece oould be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of di\u017fposition, and all those eccentricitie\u017f which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, clll aur doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FDSTER, the architect, a pupiI of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individua1,\" said he, \"about whom you are sa anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travcls ontho is1and of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never thon heard of his lordship's fame, as wo had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childe Harolde\" beirig put into our hands we rocognized the reeluse af Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been inore curious in our re\u017fearches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with tho idea of returning to Mitylenc ori some future day; but to ine that day will never return. I make this statement, believirig lt not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his 1ordshjp's good nclmc, which has been grassly slandored. He has been described as ofan vnfeeling disposltion, averse lo associating witb human nature, or eontributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plclinly gathcred from these litlle anecdotes. All the siner feelirigs of tbe heart, so elegclntly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo hclve their seat in his bosom. Tende-\nrnoss, sympathy, and cbarity appear to guide all bisactjons: and his courting lhe rcpose of solitude i\u017f an additional reason for marking bim as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose heod Benevolence hath thro wn her inant-\nle. No man can read the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of bim as a countryman. Wilb respect to hls loves or p1easures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be recei ved with coutiori, partjcularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsels before that awfuI tribunaI where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's choracler is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the wo rld's applause, is tbe surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-opproving conscience.\nTHE END\nGi1Iet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-strcet.","9":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale ls founded is very goneral in the Eost. Amang the Arabians it appears ta be comrnon: il did not, however, extend itself lo the Greeks vntil after tho establishment of Christianity; and it has only clssumed its pre\u017fenl form since the divlsion of the Latin arid Greck churches; at which time, the idca becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of mariy wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the bIood of lhe young and beautjful. In tho West it spread, with some slight variati0n, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, clnd Lorraine, where the bellef existed, that vampyre\u017f nightly imbibed a certain portiori of the blood of their viclims, who became emaciated, lost their strongth, and speediIy died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-sucker\u017f fattened\u2014and their veins became disterided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodles, and euen from the very porc\u017f of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is o curious, and,of covrse, credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an exarnination 0f the commander-in-chief and magiftratos of the plaee, they positively and unanimousIy affirmed, that, about five years bef-\nore, a cerlain Heyduke, named Amold Paul, had been hcard lo say, that, at Cassovia, on lhe froriticrs of the Turkjsh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himsclf with his bl0od. Thif precaution, however, did not prevent hirn from becoming a vclmpyre himseIf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial,many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four pcrsons had beeri deprived of life by his attacks. To provent furthcr mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is suppased to be usual in case\u017f of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and ernitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they ros0rted to lhe accustomcd remedy. A slake was driven eritirely tbrough thc heart and body of Arnold Paul, al which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. Thif done, lhey cut off his head, burned his body, andthrew the ashes into bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of thoseperfans who had previously died from vampyrisin, lest they shouId, in their turn, become agenls vpon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person \u017fucked by a vampyre bec0mes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hi\u017f turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis inonstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better odapted to jllustrate the subject of the present ohservatjons than any 0thcr instance which cauld be adduced. In many parts of Grecce it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, f0r some heinous crime committcd whilst in existence, that lhe dececlsed is not only doomed to vampyrise, bvt compelled to confirie hls infernal visitations solely lo those bcings he loved most while upon earth\u2014thofe to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and afsection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly baunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain lhe streom of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victimf, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must faIl, The youngest, best beloved of alI, Shall bless lhee with a father's name\u2014 That word sball wrap thy heart in flamo! Yet thov must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye'\u017f last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw Which free2es o'er its lifeless bluo; Then with unhallowed hand \u017fhall tear The tre\u017fses of her yellow hair, Of whlch, in life a lock when shom Asfection's fondost plcdge was worn\u2014 But now is horno away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing t0oth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afritf rave, TlIl the se in horror shrink awcly From spectre inore accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hos also iritroduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returncd froin the grave for tbe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilsl in existence. But this cannol be supposod lo have resultcd from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourlrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a cornplete type 0f purity and innocencc. The veraciou\u017f Tournefort gives a long aceount in his travels of several astonishing cases of uampyrisin, to which he pretends to have been an cyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upori this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustralive oflts esfects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending t0 prove it to be a c lassical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and intorefting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mighl be added; thoughthe present may suffice for the limits of a nate, necessorily devo-\nted to explanati0n, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that thougb the term Vampyre i\u017f the one in most general aooeptation, there are several 0thers \u017fynonymous with it, made use of in various parts of lhe worId: as Vroucolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happcried that in the midst of the dissipcllions attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of lhe lon a nobleman, more remarkablo for hi\u017f singvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around hiin, as if he could not participotothereiri. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his altention, that he might by a look quell it, and lhrowfear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those wha felt this sensatian of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deadgrey eye, which, fixing upon the object's faoe, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance to pierce through to the inword workings of the heclrt; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it cauld not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited lo every house; all wished to see him, and tbose who had been aecustomed to violerit excitement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having \u017fomething in tbeir presence capable of engaging their altention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, eithor from the blvsh of modesty, or srom the strong emotiori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mariy of the femalo hunters aftcr notoriety atlempted ta win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affectian: Lady Mercer, who had heen the mockery of every monster shewn in drawjng-roams sirice her morriage, threw herself in his way, and djd all bvt put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she st0od before him, though his eyes wcre apparently fixed upon hor's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her uriappalled impudence wa\u017f baffled, and she left the field. But tbough the comman ad ultress could riol influence even lhe guidclnce af his eyes, il was not that the female sex was indifferent to hirn: yet such was the apparent caution witb whioh he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few kriew he ever addre\u017fsed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wirining t0ngue; and whethcr it waf that it even overcame the dread of his singular characler, or that lhey were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be was as often among those females who form lhe boclst of their sex from thcir domestic virtues, as among those who sul1y it by tbeir vices.\nAboul the samctimc, th ere came to L0ndon a yourig gentleman os the name ofAvbrey: he was an orphan left with an only sisler in tho possession of great wea1th, by parents who died while he was yel in chiIdhood. Left also to bimself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they relinquisbed the more important chargeof his mind to the care of mercenclry subalterns, he cultivated inore his imaglnatlon lhan his judgment. He had, hence, that high r0mantjc feeling of honour clnd candour, which daily ruins so mony milliners' apprcntices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vioe was thrown in by Pr0vidonce merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thaught that the misery of o cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the pairiter's eye by th eir irregular folds and various co1oured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreclms of poets were the rea1ities of life. Hc was handsomo, frank, arid rich: for these reclsons, upon hi\u017f entering into the gay circles, many mothers furrovnded hjm, slriving whichshould descrjbe with least truth thoir lariguishing or romping favourjtes: the doughters at tbe same time, by their brightenirig countenances wheri be approacbcd, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into fcllse notions of his talents and bis merit. Attached as he was t0 the romance of hif solitary hours, he wasstartled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wox caridles that flickered, not from tbe presence of a ghost, but from want of sriuffing, there was rio foundation in real life for clny of that congeries of pleasing pjctures and descriptions contained jn those volumes, from which he had f0rmcd his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above described, crossed him in bis career.\nHe watcbed him; and the very impo\u017fsibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in bimself, who gave few other signs of his observation of oxternal abiects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hif imaginatian to pictvre every thing tbat slattered its propensity to extrovagant ideas, he soon formed thisobject into the hero of a romance, and dctermined to observe tho offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted wlth him, paid him attentlons, and s0 far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs wcre embarrassed, and soon faund, from the notes of preparation iri \u2014 Streot, tbat he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, hod only whetted his euriosjty, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for birn t0 perform the tour, which for inany generations has been thoughl necessary to enable the young to take some rclpid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to clppear as if fallen from thc skies, whcnever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degreo of skill shewn in carryjrig lhem on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his lntentions to Lord Ruthven, waf surprised to rcceive from hlm a proposal lo jainhim. Flatterod by such a mark of estecm srom him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the cjrcling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity of study ing Lord Ruthven'\u017f character, and now he found, that, though many moro of his act-\ni0ns were exposed to his view, the results offcred different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compclnion was profuse in his lib erality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than onough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubreycauld not avojd remarkirig, that it was not upon the uirtuous, reduced t0 indigence by the misfortunos altendarit even up0n virtue, that be bestowed hjs alms;\u2014these were sent from the doar with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk something, not to relieve hi\u017f wants, 6ut to allow him towallow in his lust,or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charjty. This was, howover, attributed by him to the greoter imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity af his Lordship, whicb was still more impressed upori his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, jnevitably found tbat there was a curse upon it, for they were al1 eith er Ied to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his campanion soughl for the centres of all fashionable vice; tberc hc entered into a1l the spiril of thc faro tclble: he betted, and alwa ys gamb1ed with success, except where lhe known sharper was his clntag0nist, and then be lost even more thcln he gained; but it was always with the same uncbanging face, with wbich ho generally watched the society around: it was not, however, \u017fo wben he encountered the rash youthful navice, or the luckless father of a numcrous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstraotedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more firo than thot of the cat whilsl dallying with the half-deod mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent yauth, torn srom the circle he adorned, cursing, in the \u017f0litude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single fartbing of his lateimmense wealth, wherowith to buy even \u017fufficierit to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immedicltely lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder hc had just snatched from the convulfive grasp of the innocent:this might but be thc result of a certain degree of knowledge, which wa\u017f not, however, capable of combating thecvnning of the more experienced. Avbrey 0ften wished lo represent this to bis friend, and bcghim to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014far each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of spcaking frclnkly and opo nly to hirn; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven jn his carriage, and amidst the uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwaysthe same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification froin it than the constanl excitement os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exa1ted imagination begari to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a tiine lost sight of his compclnion; he left him jn daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Itallan countess, whilst he went in scarch of the rnemorials 0f ari0ther almost deserted city. Whi1st he wcls thus engagod, letters arrived from England,which be opened with eager impatierice; the first was from his si\u017fter, breathing riothing but asfection; the others were from his guardians,the latter astonished him; if it had bofore entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these \u017feemcd to give him sufficient rcason for lhe helief. His guardians insifted upon hls immediately leavlng his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrosi\u017ftible p0wers of soduction, reridered bjs 1icentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been disoovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatrod of her choracter; but thathe had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, tbe partncr of his guilt, shovId be hurled from the pinnacle of unsul1ied virtv e, down to the lowest abyss of infamy clnd degrcldation: iri fine, that all thase female\u017f whom he hcld \u017fought, appareritly on account of their vjrtue, had, since his departure, tbrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of tbeir vices to the pubIic gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leavjng one, whose choracter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolued to invent some p1ausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposjng, ln the mean while, lo watcb him more closely, and to let no slighl cjrcuinstances pass by unnoticed. He entored into the same circle, and so0n perceived, that bis Lordship was endeavouririg to work upon the inexperionce of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequeriled. In Italy, it is seldom thot an unmarricd female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on bis plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered lhat an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innooent, though th0ughtless g irl. Losing rio time, he entercd the apartmerit of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly a\u017fked him his intentions with rcspect to the lady, iriforming him at the same time that he was aware of hls being about to mect her that verynight. Lord Ruthven answerod, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have vpori such an occasion; and upon being presscd whe-\nther he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing o note, to say, thal from that moment he must decline accompanying hls Lordship in the remajnder of their pr0posed tovr, he 0rdered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her 0f all be knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of hls Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day mercly sent his servarit to riotify his complete assent to a separation; hut did not hjnt any suspiclon of his plans havirig been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dirocted bis steps towards Greece, and oros\u017fing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Alhcns. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon ocoupied himsclf in traeing the faded records of ancient g lory upon monuments lhat apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling lhe deeds of sreemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and de1icate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope ofthe faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plclin, or tripped along the mou ntain's side, orie would have thought the gclzelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated natvre, sar thot sleopy luxuriovs look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search aftor antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole heauty of her form, floating as it were upon tbe wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upori an almost offacod tahIet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofteri would her tresses falllng, as she flitled around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it migbt wol1 excuse the forgetfulness af the antlquary, who let escclpe from his mind the very objecthe had before thougbt of vital imporlance to the pr opor intcrpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but norie con appreciate?\u2014It was innoccnce, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-ro0ms and stif1ing baIls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to pre\u017ferve a meinorial sor his fvture hours, she would stand by, and wotch the rnagic esfects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her notive place; she would theri describe to him the circling dance up0n thc open ploin, w0uld paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greatcr impression vpon her mind, w0uld tell him all the supernatural talcs of ber nurse. Her earnestriess and apparent bolief of what shenarrated, excited lhe interest even of Aubrey; and aften as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frjendf, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upori the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, hi\u017f blood would run cold, whilst be attempled to laugh her ovt of \u017fuch idle and horrihle fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him tbe names of old men, who hadat last detected one living among themselves, after several of lheir near relatives and childr en had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; clnd when shefound him so incredulous, shebegged af him to bolieve her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had darcd to question their existence, olways had somo proof given, which obliged them, with grief and hearlbreaking, to confess it was trvo. She detailed to him tbe troditiorial appoaronce of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate dcscription 0f Lord Ruthven; he, bowever, slill persisted in persuclding her, thal there could be no truth in ber fears, though at thc sametimc he wondered at themany coincidences which bad all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey hogan to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; hcr innocence, so contrasled with all the affectod virtues of the women among whom hc had sought for his vision of romance, won hls heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englishhabits, ina rrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more ond more attached lo the almost fairy form befare him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, f0rming a plan for some anliquarian research, he would depart, detormined not to return vntil his object wcls attained; but he always found it imposfible to fix hif attention upon tbe ruins araund him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the righ tful possessor of his thaughls. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was eucr the same frarik infantile being he had first kriown. She always seemed to part from him withreluctance; but it was because she hod no 1onger any one with whom sbe could visit hcr favourite hauntf, whilst her guardian was occupiodin sketching or uncovering some fragmentwhioh had yet escaped tbe destructive harid of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several presenl, affirmed their existence,pale with horror at the very name. Soon aster, Aubrey determined t0 proceod upon one of his exoursions, which was to detain him f0r a few hours; when they heard the name of tho place, they all at once begged of him riot to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would evcr reinain, after thc day had closed, upon any c0nsiderat ion. They described it as the resorl of the vampyres iri their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils af impending upori him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey inade light of their representatians, and tried to lough tbem out of the idea; but whenbe saw thein shudder at his daririg thus to mock a superior, infemal pawer, thc very name of which apparently made tbeir bIood freeze, he waf silent.\nNext morning Auhrey set off upon his excursion uriattended; he wossurprised to o6serve the melancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those h0rrible fiends, had inspjred them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Iantbe came to the sidc of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he prornised. Hc was,however, so occupied in his research, that be did nol perceive that day-light wauld soon end, and that in the borizon there was one os those specks which, jn tho warmer climales, so rapidly gather into a trernendous mass, ond pour aIl thoir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, m0unted hif horse, dotermined to rnake up by speed for his delay: but it was too lote. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the svn \u017fets, riight begins:and ero he bad advanced far, the power of tbe storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick beavy rcliri forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst tbe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took sright, and he was carrled witb drecldful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, slopped, and he found, by the glare of lightnlng, that he waf in tbe neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrovnded it. Dismovnting, he approached, hoping to find some one to gujde him to the l own, or clt least trusting to obtain \u017fhelter from the pelting of tbc storm. Af he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed bim to hear the dreadful shrieks of a wornan mingljng with the \u017ftifled, exultant mockeryof a lavgh, continued jn one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with o svdden effort, forced open the daor of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, tbough he called, still the sounds eoritinued, and no notice waf taken of him. He found himself in contacl with some one, whom he immediately soi2ed; when a uoice crled, \"Again baffIed!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; ond he felt himself grappled by onc whose strength seemed superhumari: determined lo sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from bis feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself vpon him, and kneelirig upon his breast, hadplaced his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave Iight in the day, disturbed hiin;\u2014he instanlly rose, and, leaving his prey, rvshed thr ough the door, and iri a momeril the crashing of the branches, as be broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; arid Auhrey, incapabIe of movin g, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the light of their torches fell vpon tbe mvd walls, and the tbatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flclkes of saot. At the dcsire of Aubrey they seorched for her who had attracted hiin by her ories; ho wos again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more hurst upon hlm, to perceive the airyform of his foir oonductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori ari\u017fing from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same farm, when ho unclosed them, strctched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness a bout her foce that seemed almost as attaching as the life thclt once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat wore thernclrks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to thi\u017f the men pointod, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickIy formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side os her who had lately been to him the object os so many brighl and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise that had died wilhin her. He knew not what his tboughls were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and takc refuge in vacaricy\u2014he hold almost unconsclously in his hand a riaked dagger of a pclrticular construction, which hod heen found in the hut. They were soon met by differenl parties who bad becri engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the cily, forewarned lhe parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To de\u017fcribe their gricf would be impos sible; but when they ascertained the cause of their c hild's dcath, they looked al Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were jnconsolable; both died brokeri-hearted.\nAubrey boing put to bed wa\u017f seized with a most violent fever, and wa\u017f often delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon LordRuthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combinotlon he seerned to beg of his former companion to \u017fpare the heirig he loved. At other times he would imprecate malediclions up0n hls bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time ta arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately ploced bimself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Wheri the latter recovered from hi\u017f dclirium, he was horrisied and startled at the sigbt of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying aImast repcntance for the fault that had cau\u017fed their separation, and still more by the ottention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled bim to his presence. His lordship seeinedquite changed; he n0 longer appeared that apathetie belrig who bad so asloriishod Aubrey; but of saon as his convale\u017fcence began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into tbe same statc of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difserence from the former man, except thclt at times he was surprised lo meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of maIici0us cxultati0n playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smi1e hauntod him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven waf appar ently engaged in watching the tidele\u017fs waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking lhe progress of those or6s, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, be appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of aIl.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, wa\u017f much weakened, and lhat elasticlty of spirit which had 0nce so distingui\u017fhed him now seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as muoh a louer of solitude and silencc as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neigh6ourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stoad by his side\u2014if hc sought il in the woods, her light step wovld appear wandering amidsl the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; theri suddenly turning round, would sbow, to hjs wild imagination, her palc face and woundod throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined t0 fly scenes, every seclture of which created such bitter associatioris in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the lender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit thosc parts of Greece neither had yet seeri. Thcy travelled in every direction, and sought every spot lo wbich a reoolIection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yct they seemed not lo heed what tbey gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they irnagined were only thc invention of individuals, whose interest it wcls to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from protcnded darigers.In consequence of thus neglecting the advlce of the irihabitants, on one occasion they travelled witb only a fow guards, more ta scrvc cls guides than as a de fence. Upon entering, bowever, a riarrowdefile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses 0f rock brought down from the neighbouring precipice\u017f, tbey had reason to repent thelr negligenco; for scarcely were the whole of lhe party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of 6ullets cIose to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, plaoing themselves hehjnd rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, rctired for a moment bchind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, jf any of the robbcrs shou1d climb ahoue and take thom in the reor, they determined at onco to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had lhey lost theshelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest 0r his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately throwri up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promjse\u017f of greclt rew-\nard, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wourided friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having ogreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thoir presence\u2014they beingcontent mcrely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pramised sum, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthven's \u017ftrength rapidly dccroased; in two days mortification ensued,arid deatb seemed advancing with hasty stepf. His conduct and appcarance had notchanged; be seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his rnind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixod upon Aubrey, who wa\u017f induced lo offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more lhan that\u2014I mean riot my life, I heed the death of my existence as little af that of thc passing day; but you may save my hariaur, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Avbrey.\u2014\"I need but littlc\u2014my 1ife ebbs apace\u2014I cclnnol explain the whole\u2014but if you would oonceal all y0u know of me, my hanour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall nol bo known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" crjed the dyirig man, raising himself with exullant vi0lence, \"Swear hy all your sou1 reveres, by all y0ur nature feors, sweclr that, for a yeor ond a day you will not iinpart your knowled ge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His cye\u017f seemed bur\u017fting fr0m their \u017fockels: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no rnore.\nAubrey rctlred lo rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstanccs attending his aoquaintance with this man r0se upon his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a c0ld shiverlng came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment 0f somethirig horrible awaiting him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to eriter thc hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met birn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having beeri conveyed by hirnself and comrades, upon his retiring, to tho pinnacle of a rieighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lor dship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon thatrose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined lo go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, wherihe had mounted to the summit he found n0 lrace ofeitber the corpse or the clothes, thaugh tho robbers swore they pointed out the identical r0ck on whioh they had 1aid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convincod tbat they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a counlry in which he had met wjth such terriblc misf0rtunes, and in wbich allclpparently conspired to heighten that superslitious rnelancholy that had seized upon his mind, he rcsolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to oonuey him to Otranto, or ta Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging ta Lord Ruthven.Amongst other lhjngs there wcls a cafe containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the deatb of the victim. Thero were several dagger\u017f and ataghan\u017f. Whilst turning them over, and examining thcir curious sorms, what was his svrprise at finding a sheatb opparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastoning to gain further pro0f, he fourid the weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly sbaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyes seerned to need no furthor certainly\u2014they feemed gazlng to be bound to the dclgger;yet still he wished to disbelievc; but the particular form, tho same varying tints upon the haft and sbeatb were alike in splcridour on both, and left no room for doubl; there were also drops of bIood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hisway home, at Rome, hjs fjrst inquiries were coricerning the lady he had attempled to snatch fr0m Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their fortune rujned, and fhe had not boen heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he wos afraid that this lady had fallen a vietim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morafe and sllent; and his only occupationconsisted iri urging the speed of the postill0ns, as if he were going to save tbe life 0f some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; o breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of bjs fathers, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and oaresses of his sister, olI memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantjne oaresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a eompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thclt winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that ljght brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never Iit up by the levity of tbe mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it whichdid not seem to arise from mlsfortune, hut from some feeling within, tbat appearedto indicate cl soul conscious of a brighter realm. Hcr step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a 6utterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was fedate and pensive. When olone, her face was never 6rightened by the smile of joy; but when her hrother breathed to her his affectjon, and wouId in her presence sorget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would bclve exchariged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were theri playing in lhe ligbt of their own natiue sphere. Shewas yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been tbought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayod vntil her brother's return from tbe continent, when he mjght be her protector. It was now, thoresore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fasl approachirig, fhould be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mclnslon of his fathers, and fed upon lhc melancholy which averpowered him. He could nol feel interest about the frivolities of fashiona ble strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; 6ut he determined to sacrifice his own comf0rt to the protection of his sister. They \u017foon arrived in town, and prepared for the nexl day, which had been announced as a drawing-r oom.\nThe cr0wd was exce\u017fsive\u2014a drawlng-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smi1e of roycllty, haslened thither. Aubrey wcls there with his sister. Whjle he was standing in a corner by him\u017felf, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time ho had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that vory placc\u2014he felthimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sovnded in bis ear\u2014\"Remem6er your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, searsul of feeing a spectre tbat would blast him, when he perceivod, at a litlle distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice 0n thif spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost resusjrig to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm 0f a friend, and forcing a passage through the crawd, he threw himsels into his carriage, and was drlven home. He poced tho room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, a\u017f if he were afraid his thoughts were bvrsting from his brain. L0rd Ruthven again bes ore him\u2014circumstances starled up in dreadful arrcly\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himsels, he couldnot beliove it possible\u2014thc dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossihle that it could be real\u2014be determinod, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his ljps, and he could not sueceed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his slstor to the assembly of a ncor relation. Leavlng her undor the protection of a matr0n, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thougbts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anothcr room, fourid his \u017fister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest converscltion; he attempted to pas\u017f and get near her, whcn one, whom he requested to movc, turned round, ond revealed to him lh0se features hc most a6horred. He sprang forward, seized hls sister's arm, and, with hurriod step, forced her towards the street: at the door he f0und bimself impeded by the crowd of \u017fervarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he wa\u017f engaged iri passing them, he agaln heclrd that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He didnot darc lo turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost diftracted. If bes0re hismind had been absorbed by onc subject, how rnuch more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster'f living again pro\u017fsed upon his thovgbts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was ln voin that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He on1y uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more he thought, the more be was bewildcred. His oath startledhim;\u2014was he then to a1low lhls monster lo raam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by hiin. But even if he were to break his oath, and disc1ose his suspicions, wbo would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretoh; bvt death, he remembered, had been already m0cked. For days he rernained in tbis state; shut up in hifroom, be saw ri0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sclke, to support natvre. At lasl, no longer capable af bearing stillness and solitvde, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly thclt iinage which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, cls oflen oxposed to the noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed peaple to follow him; but thcy were soon distanoed hy bim wh0 fled from apursuer swifter than any\u2014frorn thought. Hi\u017f conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of bis friends, with a fiend amongst them, os whosc presence they were unconscious, he determined t0 enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxi0us to farewam, in spite of his oath, aIlwhom Lord Ruthven appraached with jntimacy. But wheri he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookf were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visib1e, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strangly. Wheri,however, romanstrance proved unavailirig, the guardions thought properto interpo\u017fe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they th0ught it high tiine to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parenls.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountcred in hjs wanderlngs, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those inclrks of what they consjdercd folly, lhey engoged a physician to reside in the h0use, and take coristant care of him. He hardly appeclred to notice it, sa cornpletely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at 1ast so greclt, that he was confined to hls chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He bad became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and reoollection remainirig displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then ho would sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflieted her, he would desire hcr not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch bim\u2014if your lovefor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reserred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into cl state, w herice not even she could rouse him. Thls lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pas\u017fing, hjs incohorences became less srequent, and his mind threw off a portion ofitf gloom, whilst his guardians observed, thot several times in the day he would covnt upon hisfingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, w hen, upon the last day of the year, ono of his guardians erilering his room, began to converse with hjs physician upori the me1aricholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to he married. InstantIy Aubrey's atlention was attraeted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark ofreturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with ln society,Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be prosent at the nuptials, and desiring lo see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. Hc was apparentIy again capable os being asfected by lhe inf1uence of her lovely smile; for he pressed hor to his breast, and kissed her cheek,wet with tears, flowing at the lhought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with allhis wonted warmth, and to congrotulate her upon her marriage wlth o person so distinguifhed forrank clnd every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a looket upon her breast; opening it, whal was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who bad so lorig inflvencedhis life. He seized the portrait in a par0xysm of rage, and trclmpled it under soot. Upon her askirig hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblclnce of her future hufband, he looked as if he didnot understand her\u2014then seizing ber hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she wov1d never wed thif monster, for he\u2014 But he covld not advarice\u2014it seemed as if that voice agclin bade him rcmernber his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lard Rulhven was near him but saw no one. In the meantimethe guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought tbis waf but cl relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. Ho fell upon his knees to them, he irnplored, he begged of them to do1ay but for one day. They, attrjbuting this to the insanity tbey imagined had takeri possessi0n of his mind, cndeavoured to pacisy hirn, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had eaIled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refuscd with every one elfe. Wberi he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cavse of it; but when he learned that he was deerned in\u017fane, his exultatjon and pleasure could hardly bo concealed from those among whom he hcld gained this information. He hastened lo the house of his former eompanion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affectiori for tbe brother and intereft in his fate, he gradually wan the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist his power? His ton guohad dangers and toils to recounl\u2014could speak of himself as of an indivldual having no sympathy wlth any being on the crowded earth, \u017favc with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014couId tell how, since he knew her, hif existence, had begun to seem worthy of proservation, if jt were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knewso well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the wiIl of fate, that he gained her asfections. The title of the elder branoh falling at lerigth to him, be obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hofteriing lhe marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged \u017flate,) which was to take place the uery day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrcy, when he wa\u017f left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to hribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it waf given him; he wrote a 1otter to his sisler, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the hon0vr af those now ln the graue, who once held her in their arms af lheir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few haurs that marriage, on which he denounced lho most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it bettor not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to tho busy inmatef of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they grcldually stole away, leavirig him in the cvstody of an helplesf old woman. He seized thc opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in cl mornent found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the fir\u017ft to percejve hirn: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him srom the room, speechless with r age. When on tho stoircase, Lord Ruthven whjspered in his ear\u2014\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is disbonoured. Women are frail!\" So \u017faying, he pushed him towards his ottendants, wha, raused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey covld no langcr support bimfe1f; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, andhe was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicjan was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness jncreased; the effusion 0s blaod produced symptoms of the near approach ofdeath. He desircd his sister's guardians might be called, and when lhe midnight hour had struck, he rel ated coinposedly whot the reader has pervsed\u2014he dicd immediately after.\nThe guardionshastened to protecl Mlss Aubrey; but when thcyarrived, it wcls too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's fister had glutted thc thirsl of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all hefore him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providerico his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board one of bif Majesty's vessels, iri tbe year 1812, we put into the harbour af Mityl-\nene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pIace, and tho certain supply of cattle and vegetables olways to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies ralher out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for lhe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as vsual, at the boltom of the bay, clnd whilst the men were employed jn watering, and the purser hargaining for cattIe with the natives, the clergymari and myself took a rainble to the cave called Homer's Scbool, arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we mel with and engaged a young Greek as our guido, wbo lold us he had come from Scio with an Engljsh lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sajd the Groek, \"and would have taken mc with him; bul I did not choose to quit Mitylene, whero I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very goodman. The cottage over the hi1l, facing theriver, belongs to him, and he has left an old man iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zcchines for lt, (about L250 Englisb currency,) and has resided there about f ourteen m0nths, lhough not constantly; for he sails in his felucca uery often to tbe disferent islands.\"\nThisaccounl exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in hastening tothe house where our couritryman had resided.We wero klndly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on lhe gr0und-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitling parlour, anda 6ed-room, with o spoci0us closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain groeri-stained walls, marble tablef on either side, a large myrtlo in tbe centre, and a small founlain beneatb, which could be made lo play through the branches by m0ving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch ar sofa completedthe furniture. In the hall stood hals a dozen Englisb cane chairs, and an empty book-case: therc were no mir rors, nor a single painting. The bedchclmber had merely cl large mattres\u017f spread on the fIoor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillaw\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the \u017fitting-room we observed a marble recess, f0rmerly, the old man told us, filled with bookf and papers, whlch were then in a large seaman's chest iri the eloset: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justi-\nfied in examining tho contents. On the tablot of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; V0Iney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German languagc; Klopstock's Messlah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton's Paradife Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 18I0; several small pamphlets from the Greek pres\u017f at Conslantinople, much torn, but no English book of any descriptian. Most os tbese books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itolian clnd Latin. The Mes siah was literally scribbIed all ove r, and marked with slips 0f paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The 1ord had been reading these books the evening before he sai1ed, and forgot to place them with the athers; but,\" sald he, \"there they must lie until his return; for heis fo particu1ar, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frawn up0n me far a week t0gether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; arid I have the produce of this fclrm for the troub1e of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I poy to an aged Armenian whorcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought hore from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house extcrnally was pleasirig. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were con\u017fjderably higher than the roof. The ro0f, surr ounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey oarpet, beneath an awning of strongcoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furriished, as upon them thc Greeks pass their euenings in smoking, drinking ljght wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjoying the cvening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered lhehouse, a small stream1et glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusteririg together on it\u017f borders, arid undor lhe shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe seat with an 0rnamenlal wooden baek was placed, on which wc were told, the lord passed many 0f his evenings ond njghts till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man, \"praying\" for be was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a wee k, besidef Sundays.\"\nThc view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bjrd's-eyc view.\" A line of rlch vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins de\u017fcended in broken cascadef, until it was l0st in the woods near the mountain's basc. The sea smoath as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a IittIe on the left, lhrough a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islonds were distinclly observed, studdirig the light blue waue with spot\u017f of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did tbis; bvt ovr enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but D0minick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeriian,\" said our conduct0r, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannat you lell, old friend?\" \u017faid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not lime to visit the Armeniari, but on our return to the town welearnt several particvlars of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when be wos last upan the lsland, and even daneed with them at the nuptial feast. He gave acow to ane mcln, hor\u017fes to otbers, and cotton and silk to the glrls who live by weaving lhese articles. He aIso bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lo\u017ft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor children. Iri short, he appeared to u\u017f, from all we eollected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One ciroumstance welearnt, whioh our old friend at the coltage thought proper nat to disclose. He had o mosl beautifvl davghter, with whom the lord wa\u017foften seeri walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had b0ught her a plano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the informcltion with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing wha tbis ramblcr in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he hod philanthropy of dispositiori, and all those ecce nlrlcities which mark peculiar g enju\u017f. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupll of WYATT'S, who bad been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the lsland of Tenedos, arid I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never lhen heard os his lordship's fame, as we had been same yearf from home; but \"Childo Harolde\"heing put into our hands we rccognized the recluse of CaIcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having 6een more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we oonsoled ourselves with the ldea of returning to Mitylene ori somo future day; but to me that doywill never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite vninteresting, and in justice to bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with humon nature, or contri6utlng ln any way to sooth its so rrows, or add to its plea\u017fures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from lhcse little anecdotes. Al1 the siner feelings of the h eart, so elegaritly depicted in hi\u017f lordship's poems, seem to bave thcir seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his aotions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reosonfor mclrking him as a beirig 0n whoseheart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose hcad Benevolence hath thrown her rnont1e. No man can read the precedirig pleasing \"traits\" without feeling pr0ud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. R eports are ever to bereceived wilh caution, particularly when dlrected against mon's moral integrity; arid ho who dares justify himself before that awful triburial where all must appear, alone may censure lhe errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy 0f his genius. To do good in secret, and shun lhe world'f applouse, is the suresltestimoriy of a virtuous heart and self-clpprovjng consclence.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eovrt, Fleet-\u017ftreet.","10":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Willjam P0lidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is fourided is very general in tbe East. Among tbe Arabians it appears to be commori: it did not, bowever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the estoblishment of Christianlty; and it has 0nly assumed lts present form since tho division of the Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt is buried in thejr territory, it gradually increased, and sormedthe subjeot af many wonderful stories, still extant, of thc dcad rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautifu1. In the West it spread, with some sligbt variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief cxisled, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of theblood of their victims, wh0 became emaciated, lost tbeir strength, and speedily died of consuinptions; whilsl these human blood-svckers fattened\u2014and lheir veins became dislended to such a slate of repletion, as to couse the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from tbe very pores of thelr skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, isa ourious, and, of course, credible acoount of a particulor ca\u017fo of vampyrism, which is stated to havo occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upari an examinatlon af tbe commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pos itively and unariimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a cerlain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the frontiers of the Turki\u017fhServia, he had been tormented by a vclmpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of tbe vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his hlood. This precclution, however, did nat prevent bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death and burial, inany persons complained of bavingbeen lormented by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by hi\u017f attocks. To preventfurther rnischics, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, arid found it (as is \u017fupposed to be ufual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emjttirig at the mouth, nose, and ears, purc and florld blood. Proof hauirig been thvs 0btained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, thcy cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashe\u017f inlo his grave. The same measures were adopted with the c0rses of those persons wh0 had previously died from vampyrism, lost they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who svrvived them.\nThe universal belief is, tbat a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and suckf in his turn.\nChlef bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is bere related, be oause it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than clny other instance which could be adduced. In many parts 0f Greece it is considered cls o sort of punishmcrit afler death, for some heinous crirne committed whilst in exlstence, that the doceased js not onIy doomed to vampyrise, but compelled lo consine his infernal visitations solelyto those beings he l0ved most while upon eartb\u2014tbose to whom he was bound by ties of kjndred and afseotion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in tbe \"Giaour.\"\nBul first on eartb, as Vampyre sent, Tby corso \u017fhall from its tomh be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native pIclce, And suck the blood of all thy race; Tbere sromthy daughter, slster, wife, At midnight droin the stream of life; Yet loathe the bariqvet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Sha1l know the domon for their sire; As cursing thee, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers aro withered on thc stem. But one lhclt far thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 Thal word shall wrop thy heart iri flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014ber eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freczes o'er its lifeless 6lue; Then witb unhallowcd hand fhall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of wbich, in llfe a lock whon shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by lhee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggord lip; Then slalking to thy sullen graue, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till theso in horror fhrink awoy Froin spectre more aceursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in hif wild bul beauliful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represcnted as havlng returncd from lho grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whiIst in existenee. But this cann0t be supposed to have resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a completo type of purity and innacence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account jn hif travels os several astonishing cases of vampyrism, towhieb he pretends to haue boen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratiuesillvstratjue af its effects, has pvt forth s0me learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian err0r.\nMany ourious and intcrestirig notjces on this si ngularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limits of a n0te, riecessarily devoted to explanati0n, and whi ch may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one jn most general acceptation, there are sevcral others synonyinous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a Londan winter, there appeared at the uarious parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, rnore remarkable for his singvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate thcrein. Apporently, tbe light laughter of the fair only attraeted bis attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breclsts where thovghtlossness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awo, c ould not explain whence it arofe: soine attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flxing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce througb to lhe inward worklngs of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a Ieaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. Hi\u017f pecullarities caused him t0 be invited to every house; all wished to see him, clnd those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, arid now felt the weight of enriui, were pleasod at havlng fometbing in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of bis face, which never gainod a warmer tjnt, eilher from the hlush of modesty, 0rfrom the strong emotion of passion, tbough its sorm and outline were beavtifvl, many of the female huriters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some morks of wbat they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the moekery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, t0 attract his noljce:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as is they were unperceiued;\u2014evcri her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eye\u017f, it was not lhat the female sex was indiffererit to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife clnd innocent davghter, that sew knew he ever addressed himself to scmales. He had, however, the repvtation of a wirining longue; ond whether it was that it even ouercome the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by hjs apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those semales who form tho boast 0f their sex from their domestic virlue\u017f, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAboutthe sarne time, there came to London a young genlleman of thc name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sifter in lhe posscssion of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they relinqui\u017fbed the morc jmportant charge of his mind to the care of inerccnary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination tban his judgment. He had, hence, tbat high romantic feeling 0f honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprcntices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thoughl that vice was thrown in 6y Providenoe merely for lhe picturesque effect ofthe scene, as we see in romances: he thoughl that the misery of a coltage mcrely consisted in lhe vesting 0f clothe\u017f, whi ch were as worm, but which worc better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the reo-\nlilies of life. He was hand\u017fome, frank, and ric h: forthese reasons, upon his entering into the gay clrcles, many mothers surrounded him, slriving which shovld desorlbe with least truth their languishing or romping fav0urites: the daughters at the sclme time, by their brighlening countenances whon he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his Iips, soon led him into false notions of his talcrits and his merit. Atlached as hc wos to the romance of his solitary hours, he was start1ed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thal flickered, not fram the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was rio foundation in real life forany of that corigeries of pleosing pictures and descriptions contained in tho\u017fe volumes, from which he had formed hjs study. Firiding, however, some compenscltion in his gratified vanity, he was abovt to relinqvish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crosscd him in hjs career.\nHe wcltehed him; ond the uery impossibilily of forming an idea of the chclracter os a mon entjrely absorbed in himself, who gave few other \u017figns of his obfervation of external objects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidancc of their contact: all0wing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered itf propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romancc, arid delermined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before bim. He became acquainted with him, paid him clttentions, and so far advanced upon his notjce, that his presonce waf always recognised. He gradually learntthat Lord Ruthven's offairs wereembarrassed, arid soon found, srom the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous os gaining some informcltion respecting this singular charactcr, who, till now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardian\u017f, that it wcls time for him to perform the tour, which for many gerieralions has beon thought necessory to enable the young to take some rapid steps in tho carcerof vice towards putting themselve\u017f upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing lhem t0 appear as if fallen from the skjes, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioncd as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrylng them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive srom him a proposalto join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, bad notbing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, orid in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitberto, Au6rey had had no opportunily of studylng Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposod to his vlew, the results offered different conclvsions from tbc apparent motiues to his conduct. His companion was profvse in his libercllity;\u2014the idle, thc vagabond, ond thobeggar, received srom his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not avoid rernarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunef attendclnt euen upon virtue, that he be\u017ftowed hjs olrns;\u2014these were sent froin the door with hardly \u017fuppresfed \u017fneers; but when the profllgate came to cl\u017fk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow bim to wallow in his lusl, or to sink hiin still deeper in his iniquity, ho was sent away with rieh charity. Thif was, however, attributed by him to the greoter importunity 0f the vicious, which generolly prevails over the retlring bash fulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance obout the charity of his Lordship, which was still inore impressed upon bis mind: all those upon whoin it wcls hestowed, inevitab1y found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lowost and the most abject mifery. At Brussels and other towns thraugb which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at lbe apparent eagerness with which bis companion sought for lbe centres of all fasbionable vice; there he enlered into all the spirit of lhe faro tclble: ho betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lo\u017ft even more than be gclined; bvt it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he gencrally watched the society ar0und: it was n0t, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful riovice, or the lucklessfother of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed sortune's law\u2014this apparont abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyef sparkled with more flre thari that of the cat whilst dallylng wilh tho half-dead rnovse. In every town, he left theformerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, iri the solitude of a dungeon, the satc that had drawn him within the reaeh 0f thi\u017f fiend; whilst many a father sat srantic, amidft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wea1th, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satissy thelr present craving. Yet he took no money fram the gambling table; but immedialely lost, to tbe ruirior of mony, thelast gilder he had just snatcbed from the convuIsive grasp of the irinoeerit: this might hut be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, howevcr, capable of combating the cunnirig of the inore expcrienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend,and beg hiin to resign that eharity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not teridlo bis own prafit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speclking frankly and openly to him; however, this neuer occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the variovs wild and rich scenes of nature, was cllways the same: his eye spoke less than hif lip; and though Aubrey was near thoobject of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant exciteinent of vainly wjshlng to broak tbat mystery, which lo hjf exalted imagination begari to assume thc appearance of something supernatural.\nThey so0n arrivcd at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he lefthim in daily attendance vpon the mornjng circle ofan Italian counle\u017ff, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almoft descrted city. Whilst he was thus ongaged, letters arrived from Englarid, which he opened with eager impalience; the first was from his sister, breathing n0thing but affcction; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonifhed him; if it had before entered irito his jmagination that there was an evil power resident in his comporii0n, these seemed to give hiin sufficient reason for the belief. Hls guardians insisted upon bis iminediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his charclcter was dreadfully vicious, sor that tbe possos\u017fion os irresistible powers of seduo-\ntian, rendered his licontiouf habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his coritempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had requirod, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, lhat all thosc females whom he bad soughl, apparently on account of thejr virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had n0t scrupled to expose the whole deformity of thejr vices to the publlc gazc.\nAubrey determined upori leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright p0int on which to rcst the eye. He resolvcd to invent some plavsible protext for abandoninghim altogelher, purposing, in the mean while, lo watch hlm more cl0sely, ond to let no slight circumstances pass by unnotioed. He entered into the same circIe, and soon perceived, lhat his Lordship was endeav0uring to work upon the inexperienee of the daughter os the lady whose house he chiefly frequenled. In Italy, il is scldom that an unmarrjed female is met with in society; he was therefore obIiged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all hif windings, and saon discovered that an assignation had bcen appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thovghlless girl. Losing no timc, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly clsked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same tiine that be was aware of bis being about to moet her tbat very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thclt his intentions were such as he supposed all wovld have upon such an occasion; and upon bejng pressed whether he intended to marry hor, merely laughed. Avbrey retlred; and, irnmediately writing a note, to say, that from that momcnt he must decline accompanying hls Lordsbip in theremairider of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, inf0rmed her os all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthvcn next day inerely sent hisservant to notjfy his eomplete assent to a separation; but did riot hint any suspici0n of his plaris having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Romc, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece,and crossing tbe Peninsula, soori found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the hause of a Greek; and soon accupied himself in tracing the fadod recordf of clricient glory upon mariuments that apparently, asborned of chronicling tbe deeds os freemen only befare slaves, bad hidden themselves beneath the shelterjng soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as bjmself, exisled a being, so beautisul and delicate, that sho mlghl have formed lhe model for a pajnter wishing to pourtray on canvas\u017f the pr0mised hope of the fajthful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too mveh mind far any one to thjnk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pIain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor lype of her beauties; for who wouId have exchanged ber eye, apparently the eye of clnimated riature, for that slcepy luxurious look of tbe animal suited but to the laste of an epicure. The lighl step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his search after antiquities, and often would thc uncansoiou\u017f girl, engaged in the pursvil os a Kashmere hutterf1y, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon thc wind, to lhe eager gaze ofhim, who forgot the 1etters be had just decyphered up0n an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Dften wovldher tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhjbit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swjftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thaught of vital importance to lhe proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wh ieh all feel,but norie can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence,youtb, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawing-rooms and stif1ing balls. Whilsl he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a rnemorial for his future hours, she wovld starid by, and watch the magjc effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native plclce; she would then describc to him tbe eircling dance upori the open pIain, w0uld paint, to him in all the gl0wing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently inade a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all tbe supernatural tales of her nvrse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narraled, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed yoars amid st his friends, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong hls existence for the onsving months, his blood would rvn cold, whil\u017ft bo attempted to laugh her out of such idle ond horrible fanta sies; but Ianthe citcd to hiin the names of old meri, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives clndchildron had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she sourid him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that thase who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obligcd them, with grief and heartbreoking, to confess it was true. She detcliled to him the traditional appearanceof these moristers, arid his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate descriptian of Lord Ruthven; he, howcver, still porsisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth inber fears, though at tbe same time he wondered at tbe many coincidcnces which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthucn.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and moro to Ianthe; her innoconce, so contrasted with all the affected virtucs of the women among whom he had sought far his vision of romance, won his heart; and whilehe ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying on uneducated Groek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to tho almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarlan research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mjnd he retained an image that secmed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe wa\u017f unconscious of his love, and wasever the same frank jnfaritile being he hcld first kriown.She always secmed to part from him with reluctance; but it was becavse she had rio longer any ane with wbom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in fketching or uricovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appeclled to her parents on the subject 0f Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pole with horror al the very narne. Soori clfter, Aubrey determiried lo proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged af him nol to return at nighl, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever rcmain, after the day had closed, upon any consideratjon. They described il as the resort of the vampyres in thejr nocturnal orgies, and deriounced the most heavy euils as impending upon him who dared to cross tbeir palh. Auhrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh tbem oul of lhe idea; but when be saw them shudder at his daring tbus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very namo of which apparently made lheir blood freeze, he was silerit.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surpriscd to observe the melaricholy face of hi\u017f host, and waf concemed ta find that bjs words, mocking the belief of those harrible fiends, had inspired them wltb such terror. When he was about to deparl, Iantho cameto the side of his horse, arid eamestly begged of him t0 relurn, ore nig ht allowed the powor os theso bejngs to be put in actiori;\u2014he promised. Hewas, however, so occupied iri his research, that he did riot perceive that day-ligbl wouldsoon end, and that in lhe horizon lhere was one of lhosespecks which, in tbe warmer c1imate\u017f, so rapjdly gather into o tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoled country.\u2014He at last, however, movnted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: bvt it was too late. Twilight, in these southern c1lmotes, isalmost unknown; immediately the sun scts, night begins: and ere he had advanced for, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders bad scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue f0rked lightning seemed lo fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled sarest. The animal at lost, through fcltigue, stoppod, and he found, by tbe glare of llghtning, thathe was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushw-\nood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to findsome one to gulde him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain sheIter from the pe1ting of thc storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a rnomenl silent, allowcd him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman iningling with the stiflod, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokon sound;\u2014he was startled: hut, roused by the thunder which again rolled over hif bead, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was appareri-\ntly unperceived; for, thoughhe called, sti1l lhe sounds oontinued, and no notioe was takcn of him. He found himself in contact with some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh suceeeded; and he felt himfelf grappled by one whose strength \u017feemed superhuman: detormined to sell his life as dearly as he cauld, he \u017ftrvggled; but it was in vain: he was lifled from hisfeet arid hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his encmy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hls breast, had placed his handf upon his throat\u2014when the glare of rnany torches penetrating through lhe hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him;-\n\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, a\u017f he bro ke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now s till; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, wa\u017f so0n heard by those without. They ontered;the light of thelr t orches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the de\u017fire of Aubrey they searehed sor her who had attracted him by her cries; be was again lefl in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tbe to rches 0nce more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of hjs fair conductress brought in a lifeless corsc. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arisjng froin his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his sjde. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her ljp; yet there was a stillness abo ut her faee that seemed almost as attaching as the llfe that ance dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was bl0ad, and upon her throat were the marks of toeth havlng opened thc vein:\u2014to this the men poirited, crying, simultancously struck witb horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qvickly sormed, and Aubrey was lajd by the sjde of her who had lcltely been to hjm lhe o6ject of so rnany bright and fajry visloris, now fallen with the flower of life thot bad died within ber. He knew not whal his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and s eemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almoft unc0nsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a partioular construction, which had been found in the hut. They werc soon met by different parties who bad beon engoged in the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents os some dreadful catastraphe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; hut when they afcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and poirited to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubroy being put to bed was seized with a most violent fcver, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he would oall upon Lord Ruthven and up0n Iantho\u2014by somc unaccounta6le combination he seemed to beg of his former c0mpanion to spare the heing he loved. At other times he would irnprecate moledictions upon his hcad, and curso him as her destroycr. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrivo at Athens, and, from whateuer motiue, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, irnmediately placed himself in tbe \u017fame house, and becaine his confta nt allendant. When the latter recoverod from hisdelirium, he was horrified arid ftartled at tho sight of bim who\u017fe image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; 6ut Lord Ruthvcn, by his kind words, irnplying almo\u017ft repentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and stiIl more by the attontjon, anxiety, and carewhich he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic bcing who bad so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalesoence began to be rapid, he again gradual1y retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrcy perceived n0 differerice from the former man, except that at times he was \u017furprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: be knew not why, but this smlle baunted him. During the lclst stage of tbe involid's recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waues raiscd by the cooling br eeze, or in marking the progress os those orbs, circling, like our world, the rnoveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weak eried, and that elasticity of spirit whjch had arice so dlstinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He wos now as mvch a lover of solit ude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much cls he wished for soIitude, his mind eould not find it jn the neighbourhood 0f Athens; jf he sovght it amidst the ruins be had formerly frcquented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would clppear wandering amidst the underwood, in q uest of the modest violet; then svddenly turning round, would sbow, to his wild imaginali0n, her pale face and wounded thr0at, with a meek smile upon her 1ips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associati0ns in hismind. Heproposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom ho held himsclf bound hy the terider care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit lhose ports of Greece noither had yet seen. They travelled in every directjon, and sought every spot to which a recolleclion could be atlached: but though they thus hastened from ploce to place, yet tbey seemed n0t to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they graduolly began to slight these reports, which they imagiried were only the invention of individvals, whose interest it was to excitc the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangcrs. In consequencc of lbus negleoting the advice of the inhabitants, ori one occasian they travelled with only a few guards, more to sorve as guidcs tban as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, at lbe bottom of which was lhe bed of a torrent, wilh large masses os rock brovght down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reoson to repent their negligence; f0r scarcely wero the whale of the party engaged in lhe narrow pa ss, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed reporl of several guns. In an instant thoir guards had loft them, and, placing themfelvos behind rocks, had begun to fjre in the dlrection whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilati ng their example, retired for a moment behlnd the shelteririg turn of the defile: hut ashamed of being thv\u017f detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade tbem advance, and being exposed to unresisting sIaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they deterrnined at once to rusb forward in search 0f the enemy. Hardly had lhey losl tbe shelter os the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot ln the shoulder, which 6rought him l0 the grourid. Aubrey hasteried to his assistance; and, no longerheeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around hlm\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up thejr arms and furrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouringcabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was n0 more disturbed by their prcsence\u2014they being content meroly to guard the entrance till their coinrade should return with the promised sum, f0r which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidlydecreased; in two days mortification erisued, and deatb seemed advancing withhasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changod; be seemed as unconsciou\u017f of pain cls hc had been of the objocts about him: but towards the c1ose ofthe last evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eye oftcn fixed upon Aubrey, who was iriduced to offer his assistclnce with more than u\u017fucll earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! yov may savo me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean n0t iny life, I heed the death 0f my existence af liltle as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell ine how? I would do any thing,\" replied Avbrey.\u2014\"I need bvt little\u2014my ljfeehbs apaoe\u2014I cannot exploin the wbole\u2014bvt if you wou1d conceal all you know of me, my h0naur were free from stain in the wor ld's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" oried the dying mari, raislng himself with exultant violence, \"Sweclr by al1 your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a yoar and a day you will not lmpart yovr knowledge of my orimes or death to any living being in ariy way, whatever may happen, or whateueryou inay see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey relirod to rcst, but did not sleep; the many eircvmslances clttendjng bis acqualntanee wilh this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; whcn he remembered his oath a cold shivering came ouer him, as if from lhe presentiment of somcthing horrible awaiting him. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to eriter the hovel in which he bad left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no loriger therc, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, vpon hif reliring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had giveri his lordship, that it sh0uld be expofed to the first oold ray of the inoon that rose aster his death. Aubrey astanlshed, and taking scveral of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he bad mounted to the summit he found no trace of eilher the corp\u017fc or the clolhe\u017f, thougb the robbers swore they pointed 0ut the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For cl time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried tbe corpse for the soke of tbe clotbes.\nWeary of a couritry in wbich he had mct with such terriblc misfortunes, and in whieh all apparently con\u017fpired to heigbten that \u017fuperstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to loave it, and soon arrivod at Smyr ria. WhiIe waiting for a vcssel to conveyhim to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arrariging thase effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongsl other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, inore or less adapted to ensvre the dealh of the vi ctim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whjlst turning them ouer, clnd oxamining their curious forms, what was hi\u017f furprise at finding o sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastenirig to gain furthcr proof, he fovnd the weapon, and his borror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing lo be bound ta the dagger; yet stjll he wished to disbelieve; but the particular forin, the fame vorying tlnts upan the haft and sheath were a1ike in splendour 0ri both, and left no room for doubt; there were alfa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, al Rome, his first inquiries were coricerriing the lady he had attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents wore in distress, their fortune ruined, ond she had not beeri heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almast broken under so mariy repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen o victim to the deftroyer of Iarithe. He became moro\u017fe and silent; and his only occu pation consisted ln urgjng the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to sclve the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a brceze, which seerned abedient t0 his will, soon wafled him to the English shares; and he hastened to the marisionof his fathers, and there, for o moment, appeared to lose, in the ombraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of tbc past. If she before, by her infanline caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, shc was stlll more attachirig as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not lhat winning grace which gains the gaze and applav\u017fe of the drawing-room assemb1ie\u017f. There was none of that light hrilliancy which only exists ln the heatcd atm0sphere of a cr0wded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seein to arise from misfortune, bul from some feeling within, that appearcd to indicale a soul conscious of a brighter roalm. Her step was not that light foating, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. Wherialone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affectjon, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have oxchanged her fmile sor that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playlng iri the light of their own natiuc sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been prcsenled to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deloyed unti1 her brother's return from the continent, when he might beher protector. It was now, therefore, resolved tbat lhe next drawing-roorn, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rathor have remained inthe mansion of his fathers, arid fed vpon the meIaricholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangcrs, when his mind hcld been so torn by tho e vents he had witnessed; but he determined to facrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived iri town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd waf exces\u017five\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all wbo were anxio us to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his si\u017fter. Whi1e he was slanding jn a oorner by himself, beedless af all around bim, engaged in the rememhronce that the first tlme he had seen Lord Ruthven was in lhat very place\u2014he fe1t himself svddenly sei2od by the arm, and a voice he recognized too we1l, sounded in bis ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" Ho hod bardly courage to turn, fearful os seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, tbe sarne figure which had attracted his notice on this spol upori his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm os a friend, arid forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burstirig from his brain. Lord Rutbven ogain before him\u2014circumstances started vp in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014hi\u017f oath.\u2014He roused bimself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagjnatiori had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; sor lhough he attempted lo ask ooncerning Lord Rulhven, the name hung upon hls lips, and he could not succeed in goining information. He went a few nights afl er with his \u017fister to the assembly of a near relati0n. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recoss, and there gaue himself up to his own devouring thaughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leauing, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get riear her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, ond revealed to him those features he most abborred. He sprang forwclrd, seized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced hcr towards the street: at the door he f0und hlmself impeded by the crowd of servanls who wcre waitingfor tbeir lords; and while he was engaged in pclssing them, he again heard that uoicewhifper c1ose to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He djd not dare lo turn, but, hurryirig his sister, soori reached home.\nAvbrey became a1moft djstractod. If before bis mind had beenabsorbed by one subject, how much more complctely was it cngrossed, now that the certainty of the m0nfter's livjng again pressed upon his thoughts. His slster'\u017f attentioris were now unheoded, and it was jn vain that she intreclted him to explain to her whathad caused his abrupt conducl. He only uttered cl few words, and those terrified her. Thc more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath stclrtled hirn;\u2014was he then to allow this monster ta roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst allhe held dear, and nat avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But evcn jf be wcre to break his oalh, and disclose hjs svspicions, who would beliove hjm? He thought of employing his own band to free thc world from such a wretch; but declth,he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; fhut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate on1y wben his sister c ame, wh0, with eyes streaming with tears, bc\u017foughl him, for her sake, lo support nature. At last, no longer cclpable of bearing stillnes\u017f arid solilude, he left his houso, roamed from \u017ftreet to street, anxious to fly that lmage which haunted him. His dres\u017f becaine negleeted, and he wandered, as oftonexp0sed to the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at la\u017ft he laid him dowri to rest wherever fatigue overtook hiin. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced 6y him who fled from a pursucr fwiftcr than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea thclt he left by his absence the whole of his frjends, with a fiend amongst them, os whose presence lhey were unconsclous, ho determined to enter again into society, and walch him closcly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his 0ath, all wb0m Lord Ruthven approacbed with intimacy. But when he cntered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks wcre so \u017ftriking, his inwclrd sbudderings so visible, that hif sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongIy. When, howeve r, remonstrance proved unavailirig, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that hls mind was becoming alien ated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whicb had been before imposed upon them by Auhrcy's parents.\nDesirovs of saving him srom the injuries clnd fuffcrings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of proventing him from exposing to the general eye tbose marks of what they considered foIly, lhey engaged a phy\u017ficiari to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so comp1etely was his mind abforbed by one terrible svbject. His inc0berencc became at last so great, that he was confined to hischamber. There he would often lie f0r days, incapable of being roused. He hcld become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affeclion and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho entry os his \u017fister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is ought, da not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only onswer was, \"True! true!\" and agclin ho sank into aslate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: graduolly, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences beeome less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a porlion of its gl0om, whilst his gvardians observed, that several times in lhe day he would counl upon his fingers a definite number, and thon smile.\nThe tjme had riearly clapsed, when, uponthe last day of the ycar, one of his guardians entering his room, began to conver\u017fe with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was goirig nexl day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiausly to whom. Glad of this mark of returning jntellect, of wbich they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of lhe Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was cl young Earl whom he had met with jn socjety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intentlon to be present at the nuptial\u017f, and desiring to see his sistor. They answered riot, but in a few minutes his sistor was with him. He was opparently again copable of being affectcd by the influerice of her lo vely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at tbe thought of her brother's being once more aliue to the feelings of asfection. He began lo speak with oll his wonted warmth, and to eongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished sor rank and every accomplishment; wheri he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholdirig the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a parox-\nysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the re\u017femblonce of her future bvsband, he loo ked as if he djd not understarid her\u2014then sejzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that sho wouId never wed this morister, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed cls if that voiee again bade him remcmber his aath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rutbven was riear hirn but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knces to them, he implored, he bogged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributirig this to the insanity thcy imagined had taken possession of hismind, endeavoured to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called tbe morning aster the drawing-room, and had boeri refu\u017fed with evory one else. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he readily understood himsclf to be the couso of it; bvt when ho learned that he wcls deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardIy be concealed from tho\u017fe among whom he had gained this informatian. He hastened to tbe house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great offection for the brother and interesl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mif\u017f Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had darigers and l oils to recount\u2014could speak af himself as 0f an individua1 having no sympathy witb any being on thc crowded earlh, save withher to whom he addressed himsels;\u2014could tell how, since he knew ber, his existencc, had begun to seem worthy of preservatiori, if it were merely lhat be might listeri to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such wa\u017f the will of sate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtclined ari important embassy, which served as an excu\u017fe for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her 6rother's deranged state,) which was to lake place the very day before his departure forthe continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen clnd paper; it was given him; he wrote o letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happine-\ns\u017f, her own honour, and the hanour of those now in the gravo, who onoe held her in thejr arms as their hope and thehope of thcir house, to delay but for a few hours that mclrriage, on which hc denounced thc most heavy curses. The servants promised lbey would deIiver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought il better not to harass any more the mirid of Miss Aubrcy by, what heeonsidered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without restto the busy inmates of the house; clnd Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceiued than des cribed, the notes of busy preparatlon. Morning came, and the sound os carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcaine their vigilance, tbey gradually stolc away, leaving bim in thecustody of an helpless old woinan. He seized the opporlunlty, wjtb one bound was ovt of the room, and in a momenl found himself in the aparlmcnt where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first lo perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from tho room, speechless with rage. Wheri on the stcllrcaso, Lord Rulhven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, yaur sister is dishonovred. Women arefrail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his altendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come ln search of him. Aubrey could no longer support hlmself; his rage not finding vent, had braken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present wbcn he entered, as the physjcian was afraid of agitating her. The rnarriage was solemnized, ond the bride clnd bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increa\u017fed; lhe effusi0n of blood produced sympt0ms of the near approach of doath. He dcsired his sister's guardians m ight be called, and wben the midnight haur had struck, he relaled composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immedialely after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Misf Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was tao late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, arid Aubrey's sister had glutted tbe thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tbe world was all bofore him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on boord one of his Majesty's vessels, iri the year 1812, we put into the harbour af Mitylene, in the is1and of that name. The bcauly of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, jnduce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though jt Iies rather out os the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wo landed; as ufuaI, at the bottom of thebay, and whilst the men werc employed iri watering, and the purser bargainingfor cattle wilh the natlves, the clergyman and mysels took a ra mble to tho cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been bef0re. Dn the brow os Mount Ida (a smoll monticvle so named) we mct with and engaged a young Greekas 0ur guide, who told uf he had eome from Scio with an English lord, who left the island fourdays previous to our arrival jn his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said lheGreek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, wbero I am likely lo get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hlll, facing the river, belongs to him, arid he has Ieft an old man in charge of it: he gaue Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currericy,) ond has resided there ahout fourteen months, thaugh not eonstantly; for he sails inhis felucca very often to the differenl islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost n0 time in hastening to the housowhere our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by cln old man, who conducted us ouer the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor\u2014an entrance haIl, a drawing-room, a sitting parl0ur, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were al1 sirnply decorated: plain green-slained walls, mclrble tables on ejther side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountairi berieath, which could be made to p1ay through the brancbes by moving a spring fixod in the side os a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a largc eouch or sofa coinplcted the furnilure. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there werc no mirrors, nor a slngle pclinling. The bedchclmber had merely a large mattress spread on the sloor, with two stufsod cotton quiltf anda pillow\u2014the cammon bed lhroughout Greece. In the sitting-room we obferved a rnarblo recess, formerly, the old man told us, fillod with books and papers, which were then in a Iarge seaman's ohestin the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contenls. Dn the tob lel of the recess lay Voltairo's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rous\u017feau's works completc; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmcrman, in the German language; Klop\u017ftock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English bo0k of ariy description. Most of these books were fil1ed with marginal riotes, wrjtten with a pencil, in Italian and Lcltin. The Messiab was literally scribbled all over, arid marked wjth slips of paper, on which alsowere remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Iord had been reading these books the evening besore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said ho, \"there they must lie untjl his roturri; for he is so particular, that were I to mave ane lhirig without orders, he would frown upori me for a week together; he is otberways very good. I once did him aservice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of takjng caro af il, except twenty zech ines which I pay to an agcd Armenian who resides in a srnall cottclge in the wood, and whom the lord broughl here froin Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanceof thcbouse externally was pleasing. The portic0 in front was fifty pacef long and fourteen broad, and the f1uted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work comioes, (as it is now customary iri Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath cln owning of ftrong coarse linen. M0st of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, dririking ligbt winos, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying tbe euening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we eritered tbe house, a small streamlot glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenirigs and nights till twelve o'clack, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" soid the aId man, \"praying\" for he was very dovout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from thls seat was what may 6c termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye lo Mo urit Calcla, covered with olive arid myrtle trees in bIoom, and on tho summit of which an anciont Greek temple oppeclred iri majestic de cay. A sma ll stream issujng from the ruins descended in broken ca\u017fcades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sca smootbas glafs, arid an harizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates tbe view in frorit; and a little on the lest, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, seueral small islonds were diftinctly obscrved, studding the light blue wave wilh spots of emerald green. I seIdom enjoyed a uiew moro than I did this; but our enqu-\niries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in thi\u017f romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wha had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" soid our conduotor, \"could tell, 6ut I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And canriot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had nol time to uisit the Armenion, but on our return to lhe town we learnt several partioulors of the isolated lord. He had portioned oight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even daneed with them at the nuptial feast. He gclve a cow to one man, horfes to others, and colton and silk to the girls who 1ive by weauing these articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the paor ohildren. In short, he appeared to u\u017f, srom all we collocted, to have beeri cl very ecoentric clnd benevolent character. One circumstance we leamt, which our old friend at the cottoge lhought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had 6ought her a piario-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with whlch we departed from the peaceful isle of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, gues\u017fing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy 0f disposition, and oll those eccentricities whleh rnark peculiar genius. Arrivod at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling jn company witb Mr. FOSTER, thc architect, o pupil of WYATT'S, wha had been trovelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said be, \"clbout whom you are fo anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him cll Milylene.\" We hcld never tben heard of his lordship's fclme, as we had 6ecn some yoars from hoine; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put int0 our hands we recognized the recluse of Ca1cla in every page. Deeply did we regrel not havirig been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning t0 Mitylene ori some future day; but to me that day will novcr rcturn. I makc thls statement, believlng it not quite unjnteresting, and in justioe to hjs lordship's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associalingwith humari nature, or contribuling in any way to sooth its sorrowf, or add to its pleasures. Tbe fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdolef. All the finer feelings of the hoart, so elegantly dcpieted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose af solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a bei ng ori whose hoarl Religion hatb set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inantle. N0 man can read thepreceding pleasing \"traits\" withovt feeling proud of him as a countrymon. With respect to his l0vcs or pleasures, I do not assume a right to giuo an apinion. Reports are ever to 6e received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral iritegrity; and he who dares juslify himself before that awful tri6unal where all must appear, alone may consvre the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun thcworld's applause, is tbe surest testimony of a virtuous heart and sels-approving confcience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printcr, Crown-court, Floet-street.","11":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori\nTHE super\u017ftition upon which thi\u017f tale is fourided is very general in the East. Among the Arabians il appears to be common: it did nat, however, extend itseIf to the Greeks uritil after the estclbli\u017fhment of Christianity; and il has only assumed its present farm since the division of the Latin and Greek ohurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondorful stories, still extont, of lho dead rising from tbeir graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight voriat ion, all over Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorroine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightIy imbibed a certain portion of the blood of thoir victim\u017f, who became emaclaled, lost their strength, and spcedily died of consumptions; whilst thefe buman blood-suckers fattened\u2014and thcir veins became dislended to such astate af repletion, as to cause the blood ta flow from all the passagos of lheir bodies, and cven from the very pares of their skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, oredible account os a porticular case os vampyrism, which is stated to bave occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appeors, tbat upon an exomination of the commander-in-ehief and magistrotes of the place, they positively and unclnimously asfirrned, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, namcd Arnold Paul, had beeri heclrd to say, that, at Cassouia, on the froriticrs of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormentod by a vompyrc, but had found a way to rid himself os the evil, by eating soine of the earth ovt of the vampyre's grave, ond rub6ing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, dld not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hirnself; sar, about twenty 0r thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of having been lormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been depriuedof 1ifc by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitonts hauing consulted their Hadogni, took up tbe body, and found it (as is supposed t0 be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptiori, and emitting at thc moulh, nose, and ears, pure and florid 6lood. Pr oof having been thus obtclined, they resorted to the accustomed rem edy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported t0 have cried out as dreadfu1ly as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his hody, and threw the ashes inta his grave. Tbe same moosures were adoptod with the corses of those porsons who had previovsly died from vampyrism, Iest they should, in their turn, become agentf upori others who survived lhem.\nThe universal belief is, lhat a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hls turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because lt seoms hetter adapted to illustrate the subicct of tbe prescnt observations than any ot her instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Groece il is considered as a sort of pvnjshment after dealh, for some hein0us crime committed whilst in exislence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his inserncll visitatlons solely to those beings he loved most whilc upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties af kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to iri the \"Giaour.\"\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from jts tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And \u017fuck the b1ood of all thy race; Thcre srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streclm of life; Yel loatbe the banquet which persorce Must feed thy livid living corse, Tby victiins, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing lhem, Thy flowers are withered on the stem.

But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout tho whole of thetale as a coinplete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long aooount in his travolf of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to bave been ari eyewitness; ond Calmet, in his greal work vpon this subject, besides a variety 0f aneodotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a cIassical, af we1l as barbarian error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mlght be added; though the pre\u017fent rnay suffice for the limits of a noto, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, lhat though the term Vampyre is the one in most genercll acceptcllion, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in varlous parts of lhe wor1d: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the rnidst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, lhere appea-\nred ot the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sirigularities, thcln hjs rank. Ho gazed upon the mirlh around him, as if he could n0t parlicipate thercin. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair 0nly attracted his attention, thal he might by o look quell it, and throw foar into tbose breasts where thoughtlcsfness reigned. Thoso who felt this sonsation of awe, could not explain whence it clrose: sorne altributed it to the dead grey eye, wh ich, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to piorce through to the iriward workings of the heart;bul fell upon the cheek witb a leaden ray that weighcd upori the skin it could not pass. His peouliarities caused him lo be invited to every house; all wished to soe him, and those who had beeri accustomed to violent excltement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagirig their attenlion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint,cithcr from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outllne were beavtiful, mclny ofthe female hunters after n otoriety attempted lo win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of whal they might term affection: Lady Morcer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marrlage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mounte6ank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in voin:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyef were apparently fixed upan her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014evenher unappalled impudonce was bafflod, and sho left the field. But lhough the common adultress could not influence even the guidanee of his eyes, jt was not that the female sex was indifserent to him: yet such was thc apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He bad, however, lhe reputationof a winning tonguo; and whelher it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among tbose females who form the boast of their fex from their domestio virtues, as among lhose who sully it by their vices.\nA6out the same time, there came to Lo ndon cl young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sister in the possessi0n of great wealtb, by parents who died whlle ho was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinqui\u017fhed the more lmportant charge os his mind to the care of rnercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feelirig of honour and candour, whicb dally ruin\u017f so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all tosympathise with virtue, and tbought that vice was thrown in by Provldenoe merely for the pjcturesque effecl of tbe soene, as we see in romances: he thought that tbe misery of a cottagc merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but whi ch were betteradapted t0 the pairiter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the reolities os life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasonf, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which sbould describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightenjng countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into salse notians of his ta1ents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tollow arid wax candlcs that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation ln real life sor any of that congeries af pleasing pictures and descriptions conlained in those volumes, from which be had formed his study. Finding, however, some compcnsation in his gratified vanity, he was aboul to relinquish his dreamf, when the extrclordinary being we have abovc described, crossed him in his career.\nHe walched hiin; and the very impossihility of forming on idea of the charactor af a man eritirely absorhed in himself, who gaue few other signs of hi\u017f 0bservation of extornal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: a1lowing his imagination to picture eucry thirig lhat flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soon formed this object into tbe hero of a romance, and determincd to 0 bserve the 0ff\u017fpring of his faney, rather than the person before him. He became acqvainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far clduanced vpon his notice, thot his presence was aIways recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthueri's affoirs were embclrrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, lhat he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular charaeter, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiaris, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necefsary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the caroer of vicc towards putting themselves upon cln equality with lhe aged, and not allowing thern to appear as if fallen frorn the skies, whcriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of prajse, occording to the degree of skill shewri in carrying lbem ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such o mark of esteem from hirn, who, apparently, had nothing in co mmon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they hcld passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunily of stvdying Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found, th at, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the resvlts offered different ooriclusions srom the apparent motives to his conduct. His companjon was profusc in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond,and the bcggar, received from his hclnd more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey cauld not avo id remarking, that lt was nol upon thc virtuous, reduced lo indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beftowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door wilh hardly svppres\u017fcd sneer\u017f; but when the prafligatc came to ask something, not to rclieve his wants, but to aIlow him to wa1low in his luft, or to sink him \u017ftill deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the grealer importunity ofthe vicious, which generalIy prevai ls over the retiring bashfulness of the virtu0usindigent. There was ane circumstance about the cbarity of his Lordship, which was still more impre\u017fsed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found tbat there was a curse upon jt, for they were all either led to the scaffold, 0r sunk to the loweft and the most abject misery. At Br ussels clnd other towns through wbich they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought for lhe centres of all fashjonab1e vice; lhere he entered into all tho spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled wilh svccess, except where the kriown sharper was his anlagonist, ond then he lost euen more than he goiried; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watched the sociely around: it was not, however, so whon he encounlered the rafh youthful novico, or the lu ckless father of a numerous family; then his very wi\u017fh seemed fortune's law\u2014tbis apparent abstractedness os mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with morc fire thcln that of the cat whilst dallying with lhe balf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the sormerly asfluent yo uth, torn from the cjrcle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dvngeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fjend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst tho speaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single sarthing of hi\u017f late immenfe wealth, wherewith to buy overi sufficient to salisfy their present cravirig. Yct he took rio money fr0m the garnbling table; but immedlately losl, to theruinor of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the irinocent: this might but be lhc result ofa certain degree of knowledge, which waf not, howev er, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to repreferit tbif to his friend, and bog him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend lo his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him soine opportunity 0f speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his oarriagc, and amidst thc various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; ond though Aubrey was near the object of his curiofity, be obtained no groater gratification srom it than the constant exoitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hif exalted lmaginationbegan to asfume the appeararice of something supernotural.\nThcy soon arrived at Rome, arid Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he lest him in daily attendarice upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the mernorials of another a1most deserted city. Whilsl he was thvs engaged, letters arrived from England, whicb he openedwitb eager impaticnce; the first was from his sister, breathing nolhing but afsection; lhe others wcre from his guardians, the latter ast0riished him; if it had before entored irito his imaginatlon thatlhere was an eullpower resjdent in his companlon, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately lcaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vioious, for that the pofses\u017fion of irresistibIe powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to sociely. It had boen discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enbancehis gralificatiori, that his victim, the partner of hi\u017f guilt, \u017fhould be hurled from tho pirinacle of unsullied uirtve, down to thc lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom hc had sougbt, apparently on accourit of their virtue, had, since hjs departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expofe the whole deformity of tbelr vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon Ieaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on wbich to rest tbe eye. He resolvod to invcnt fome plausible pretext for abandoning him altogelher, purposing, in the rnean wbile, to watch him moro closely, and to let no slightcircumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered int0 the same circle, and \u017foon perceived, lhat his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperierice of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seIdom that an unmarried female is mel with in soclety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fol10wed him in all his windings, clnd soon djscovered that clri assignation had been appointed, whlch would most likely end in lhe ruin of an irinocent, though th0ughtless girl. L0sing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, inf0rming him at the same time thal he was aware 0f his being ahaut to meet her that very nlght. Lord Ruthven answered, lhat his jntontions wero sueh as he svpposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed wbether be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writingo note, lo say, thot fr0m that momerit he must decllne accompanyirig his Lordship in tho remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seck other apclrtments, and calling upon tbe motber of the lady, informed her of alI he knew, not only with regard to hcr daughter, but also concerning the characler of his Lordsbjp. The a\u017fsignation was prevented. Lard Ruthuen next day mere ly sent hif servant to notlfy his complete assent to a scparation; but did nol hint any suspicion of his plans having boen foiled by Aubrey's iriterposltion.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and cros\u017fing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek;and soon occvpied himself in lracing the faded recards of ancientgIory upori monuments lhat apparently, ashamed of cbronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Undcr the same roos as himself, exislcd a beirig, so beauliful and delicate, that she migbt have formed the model for a painter wlshing to povrtray on canvass the promifed hope of the failhful in Mclhomet's paradjse, saue thot hcr eyes spoke too mvch mind f0r any one t0 think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along tbe mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typc 0f hor beavtics; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparenlly tbe eye of animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious loak 0f the animal suited but t0 the taste of cln epicure. The light \u017ftep of Ianthe often accomponied Au6rey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged jri the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the wholebeauly of her forin, floating as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gaze of him, who s0rgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an aImost effaced tablet, in the c0ntemplati0ri of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted araund, exhibit in the sun's ray svch delicately brilliant and swif tly fad ing hves, it might wellexcuso the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the vory object he had before thaught of vital importance to the proper inlerprelalion of a passagein Pausclnias. Bul why attempt to describecharms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected hy erowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of whioh he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and walch the magic effects of his peneil, in tracing the scenes of her natiue ploce; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open pla in, would pclint, to him in all tbe glowing colours of youthfvl memory, the marriage pomp \u017fhe remembered viewlng in hor infaricy; and then, turning to subjects lhat had evidently madea greater impression upan her mind, would tell him al1 the supernatura1 tales os her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she to1d him the tale of the llving vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearcst ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fema1e to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, his bl0od would run cold, whilst he atternpted ta laugh ber out of such id1e ond horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the riames os old men, who had clt last detected onc living ainong themselves, after soveral of their near relatives arid chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend'f appetito; and when she found him so incredulouf, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked,that those who had dared to queslion their exjstence, always had some proof glvcn, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She dotailed ta him the traditioncll appeorance of these monsters, and his horrar was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descripti0n 0f Lord Ruthven;hc, however, still persisted in persuading her, lhat there cou1d be no truth in her fears, though at tho same time he wonderod at the many coiricidonces whichhad all terided to exci to a belief inthe \u017fupernatural power of Lord Rulhuen.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and inore lo Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all thc affected virtues of tho women clmong whom he had sought for hjs vision of romance, won his heart; arid while he ridiculed the idea of a young man os English habits, marrying an unedueated Greek girl, still he found himfelf more and more attaehed to the alm ost fairy form besore him. He would tear himsolf at tirnes fr0m hor, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return unlil his object was atlained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentian upon the ruins oround him, whiIst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possess0r of his thoughts. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile heing he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was beccluseshe had n0 longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite hounts, whilst her guardian waf occupied ln \u017fketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and tbey b0th,with several present, affirmed their existerice, pale with harror at tbe very name. Saon after, Aubrey determined toproceed upon one of bif excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; whon they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as hemust necessarily pclss through a wood, whcre no Greek would ever remajn, after tbo day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as tbe resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgjes, and donounced the most heavy evj1s as impending upon him who dorod to cross thcjr path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them sbudder at his daring thus to mock o superior, infernal power, the very name of wh ich apparently made their blood frecze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatt ended; he was surprised lo observe tbe meIancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hls words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired thern with such terror. When he was a6out to depart, Ianthe caine t0 the fide of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to returri, ere night allowed tho power of these beingsto be pvt in actiori;\u2014he promisod. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot perceive that dcly-lighl would foon end, and that ln the h0rizon there was one of those speck\u017f which, ln the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a trernendous inass, and pavr all lheir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, howeuer, mounled his horse, detcrrnined to make up by speed for hjs delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these soulhern climates, is almost unknown; immediatcly the sun scts, night begins: and ere he had advariced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an jnlerval of rest\u2014its thick hcavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilft the blue forked lightning seemed to fal1 arid radiate al his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entarigled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, lhat he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel lhat hardly lifted itself up frorn the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approa-\nched, boping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain she1ter from the peltirig of the storm. As he approachod, the tbunde rs, for a moment silent, allowed him to hoar the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifIed, exultant m0ckery of cl laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: bul, roused by the thunder whjch agairi rolled over his bead, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found hjmself ln utter darkness: the s ound, however, guided him. He was appclrently unperceived; for, though be called,still the sourids cantinued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, wham he immediately seized; when a voicc eried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh fucceeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whase strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force againstthe ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon hiin, and knceling upon hjs breclst, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the gIare of mclny torches penctrating through thc hole lhat gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rosc, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heord. The storm was riow still; and Aubrey, jncapable of mouing, was soon heard by those without. Tbey entered; the lighl of their torche\u017f fell upon the mud walls, and the thalcb loaded0n every individual strawwith heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had altracted bim by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what wcls his horror, whcn the ljght of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive lhe cliry form af his fair conductress brought in a ljfelefs corse. He shut bis eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori arisjng fromhis dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, strelched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess abovt her sace that seemed almosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throal were the marks 0f teeth hauing opened thc vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultclneousIy struck wilh borror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyrc!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the flower of Iifo that had died withiri her. He knew not what hls thougbts were\u2014hif mind was benumbed and seemed to \u017fhun refloction, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconscioufly in his harid a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. Thcy were soon met by different parties wbo had been engaged ln the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they appraached the eity, forewamed the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To dcscribe thoir grief wou ld bc impossible; but when they ascerlajned tho cause of their child's doath, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed tothe corse. They were incons0lablo; both died broken-heclrted.\nAubrey being put to bed wcls seized wlth a inost violent fever, and was osten delirious; in the so intervals he wouId call upon Lord Rulhven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountoble combinalion he \u017feemed to beg of his former c0rnpanion to spare the being he lovcd. At othor times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at thif time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive,upon hearirig of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his const ant atteridant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he wcls borrjfjed and starlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined witb that of a Vclmpyre; bvl Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implyjng a1most repentance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and fti1l rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showcd, soon reconciled him tohis presence. His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; bul as soon as his convalescence 6egan to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference srom the former man, except tbat at tjmeshe was svrprised to meet his gaze fixcd intently upon bim, with a smile of malicious exuItatjon playing vpon his lips: he knew n0t why, but tbjs smi1e haunted him. Durlng the last \u017ftage os the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engagcd in walching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking tbe progress os tho\u017fe orbs, circIing, like our world, thc movele\u017fs sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared lo wisb to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's inirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastjcily as spirit which had once so distinguished him now feemed to have fled for ever. Ho was now as much a lover of solitude and silenco as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in thc neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formcrly frequented, Iarithe's form stood 6y bis side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, bcr light step would appear wanderirig amidst tbe underwood, in queft of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, would show, to his wiId imagination, her pale face and wounded tbroat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of whjcb crealed such bitter associotions in his mjnd. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom heheld himself baund by the tender care he hcld taken of hjm during his lllness, that they \u017fhould visit those part\u017f of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but tbough they thus bastened from place t0 pIace, yet they seemed not lo heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight tbese reports, which they lmagined were ori1y the inventjon of individuals, whofe interest it was to excite tbe gcnerosily of those whom they defended from pretended dariger\u017f. In consequerice of lhus neglecting the advice of the inhabitarits, on one occasion they travelled witb onlya few guards, more to serve as guidcs than as a defence. Upon entering, howover, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whicb was tho bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from thc neighb0uring precipices, they had reafon to repent their riegligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in tbe narrow pclss, when thcy were startled by tho whistling of bvllets close lo their heads, and by the echoed report af several guns. In an instant their gvards had left them, and, plclcirig themselve\u017f behind rocks, had begun to fire in tbe direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their exomple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn 0f the defile: but ashamed of being thus detairied by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and beirig exp0sed to unresisting slaughter, if any of lhe robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at 0nee to rush forward in search of the cncmy. Hordly had they lost the shelter of the rock, wben Lord Rulhuen receivod a shot in the shoulder, which broughl hlm to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was s0on surprised by seeing the robhers' foces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up thelr arms and furr endered.\nBy promises of greclt reward, Aubrey soon induced them ta convey his wounded friend to a neigbbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their prcsencc\u2014they being content merely to guard the ontrance lill their comrade should retum with the promised surn, sor which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and declth seemed aduaricing with ha\u017fty stcps. His conduct and appeararice had not changed; he seemed as unconsciouf of pain as he had been os the objects abaut him: but towards the close of the last evcning, bis mirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofteri flxed upori Aubrey, wbo was induced to offor his assistarice with more thcln usual earnestness\u2014\"Asslst me! you may save me\u2014yov inay do more than tbat\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existcnce as little as that of the passing day; 6ut you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my lifeebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if yov wovld concecll all y0u know of me, my honour were free from stainin the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall nat be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying mari, raising himself with exultarit violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fears, swear that, sor a year and a day you will riot impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to ony living being in ony way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014Hjs eyes seemed bursting from their fockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his piIlow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retircd to rest, but did not sleep;the many clrcumslances alteriding his acquairitance with this man ro\u017fe upon his mind, and be knew not why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering came over bim, as if from the preseritiment of samething horrible awailing him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to enter the hovel in wbich he had left thc c orpse, when a r0bber met hirn, and informed him that it wos no longer there, having been conveyed byhim\u017felf and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinac1e af a neighbouring movnt, according to o promise they had given his lordshlp, that it should be exposcd to the first cold ray of tbe moon tbat rose after his deatb. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it 1ay. But, when he bad mounted to the summit he found no trace ofeitber the corpse or the clothes, though the rob6ers fwore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered ln conjectures, but be at last returned, convinced that they had buried lhe corpse f0r the fake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terribIe misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heigbten lhat superstitious melaricholy that had seizedupon his mlnd, he rcsolved to leove it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wailing for a vessel to corivey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging tbose effects hehad with bjm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among\u017ft olher things tbere was cl case containing several weapons of offence, more or lefs adapted to erisure the deatb of the victim. There wero scveral daggers clnd atoghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining lheir curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently omamented in lhe same style as the dagger discovered in the fatcll hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discavered tbat it fitted, though peculiorly shaped, the sheath he held in his band. His eycs seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bovnd to the d agger; yet still he wifhed to disbelleve; but tho particular form, the saine varyingtints upon the hoft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left rio room for doubt; there were also dropf of blood on each.\nHo loft Srnyrna, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to sriatch from Lord Ruthven's \u017feductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortunc ruined, and she had not been heard of sincc the depclrture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had sclllen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He becamo morose and silent; and his orily accupation con\u017fisted in urging the speod of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived clt Calclis; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his wi1l, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his falhers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraccs and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine care\u017fses, had gained his afsection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still morc attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of thot light brilliancy which only exists in tbe heated almosphere of a crowded apartrnenl. Her blue eye was ncver lit vp by the levlty os the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it wbich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from \u017fome feeling within, that appeclred to indicate a soul consoiousof a brighter re alm. Her step wa\u017f not that light footing, which stray\u017f where'er a butterfly or a co1our may attract\u2014it was \u017fedate and pensive. When alone, her sacc was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed lo her his affection, and would in her presencc forget those griefs she knew deslroyed hjs rcst, who wauld have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed a\u017f if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was yet anly cighteen, arid hod not been presented to tho world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he rnjght be her prolector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which wasfast approacbing, should be the epoch of hcr eritry into the \"busy scerie.\" Aubrey wovId rather havc remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the meloncholy which overpowered him. He could not feel intercst abo ut the frivolities os foshionablc strangers, when his mind bcld been so lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he determi ned to sacrifioe his own comfort to lhe proteclion of his sislor. They soon arrived in tawn, and prepared for the next day, which had been onnounced as a drawing-room.\nTho crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had nol been held for a long time, and all who wero anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, haslened thither. Aubrey wasthere with his sister. Wbile hc was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all arou nd him, engaged jn the romembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that uery place\u2014he felt himself suddenly sei2ed by the arm, arid a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember yaur oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blost him, when be perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notjce on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed tlll his lirnbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was ob1iged to take the arm os a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced lhe room with hvrried steps, and fixod his handf upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bur\u017fting froin his brain. Lord Ruthven again befare him\u2014circumstancef startod up iri dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014bis aath.\u2014He roused himse1f, he couId not bolieve it possible\u2014the dead ri\u017fe again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjvred up lho imclge his mind was resting upon. It was imp0s\u017fible that it eould be rea-\nl\u2014he determined, therefore, to ga again into society; for though he altemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his llps, and he cauld n0t sucoeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leavjng her under the prolection 0f a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to hi\u017f own dev0uring thoughts. Pcrceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another r0om, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest eonversation; he attempted to pas\u017f and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turried round, and revea1ed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arin, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: al the door he foundhimself impeded by the crowd os servants who wcre waitirig for their lords; clnd while he was engaged iri passing them, he again heard that voice whifper olose to him\u2014\"Remcmber your oath!\"\u2014He did not daro to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey beeclme alinost diftracled. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more c0inpletely was it engrossed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again pres\u017fed upon his thoughtf. His fister's alteritions were now unheedod, and it was in vajn that she intreated him lo explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildercd. His aath slartled him;\u2014wa\u017f he tberi to a1low this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon hls broath, amidst allhe held dcar, and nol avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his ooth, arid disclosehis suspicionf, who would believc him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister cclme, who, with eyes streaming wilh tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street tostreet, anxiovs to fly that image wbich haunted him. His dress became rieglected, and he wandered, as often exposed lo the noon-day sun as to tbe midnjght damps. He was no longer lo he recognized; at first he returned with the evoning to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whercver fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him wbo fled from a pursuerswlfter than any\u2014from lhought. His conduct, however, suddenly changcd. Struck with the idea that he left by bis abserice the whole af his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they werc unoonscious, ho determined to enter again into society, and watch himcloscly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oatb, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with iritimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were \u017fo striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sisler was at last obliged to beg of him to abslairi from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strorigly. Wheri, however, remonstrance proved unavailjng, the guardians thought proper to interpase, arid, foarjng thot bis mind was hecoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume agoin that trvst wblch had been hefore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirouf os saving him fromthe injvries arid susferings he hcld daily encountered in his wclnderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged cl physician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to riotice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so greot, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incclpable of belng roused. He had beeome emaciated, hjs eyes had attained a glassy luslre;\u2014the only sign of clffection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tbe cnlry of his sister; then he would somotimes start, and, scizing her hands, with looks thal \u017feverely afflicted her, he wauld desiro her not lo touch him. \"Oh, do nat touch him\u2014if yourlove for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answcr was, \"True! true!\" ond again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. Thjs lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohorences became less frequent, and hif mind tbrew off a portion of its glooin, wbil\u017ft his guardiaris observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fjrigers a definite numhor, and then fmile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upori the last day of tho year, oneof his guardians eritering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubrey's being in so clwful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the namc of the Earl of Marsden. Tbinking this was a young Earl wbom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonlshed them stjll mare by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to seo his sjster. They answered not, bul in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capoble of being affected by the irifluence of ber lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kifsed her cheek, wet with tears, flowingat the thougbt of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her vpon hor marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and overy accomplishmerit; whenhe \u017fudderily perceived a locket upon her brea\u017ft; opening it, whclt was hls surprise at beholding the featuros of the monster who had so long jnfluenced his life. He seized tbe portrait in aparoxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upan her asking him wby ho thuf dcstroyed the resemblance ofher future husband, he looked as is he did not vnderstand her\u2014then seizing hor hands, arid gazing on her wjth a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that sbe would never wed this monster, far he\u2014 But he could not aduance\u2014it seerned as if that voice again bade him rernember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthvon wos near him 6ut saw no one. Iri lhe meantime the guardiaris and pbysician, wbo had beard the whole, and thought lhis was but a return of hi\u017f disorder, entered, and forcing him srom Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leavc hirn. He fell vpon his knoes to them, he iinplared, he begged of them ta delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken p0sse\u017fsion of his mind, endoavouredto pacify him,and retired.\nLord Ruthven hcld ccllled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refufedwith every one else. Whcn hc heard of Aubrey 's ill hea1th, be rcadi1y understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultatiari and pleasure could hardly be coriceaIed from those among wham he had gained this inforination. He basteried to the house of his former companion, and, by coristant attendarice, and the pretence 0f great affection for the brother arid inlerost in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mis\u017f Aubrey. Who could resift his power? His tongue had dangers and toils t0 rocount\u2014could speak of himself a\u017f of an individuol hclving no sympatby witb any being on the crowded earlh, sove with her to whoin he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had beguri to seem worlhy of preservation, if lt wore merely that he might lifton to ber soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's orl, or such was lhe wllI of fate, that he gained hor affoctions. The litle of the elder branch falling at length to him, he 0btained an important embassy, which served as anexcuse for ha\u017ftening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's dorariged state,) which was to take plaoe the very day bef0re hif departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the pbysician and hif guardians, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter lo his fister, corijuring her, as she valued her own hoppiness, her own h0nour, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held ber in lhelr arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hour\u017f thot marriage, on which he denounced the m0st heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it;but giving it to lhe physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Avbrey by, what he considered, the ravingf of a maniac. Night passod on without rest ta the busy inmates of the h0uso; and Aubrey heord, with a horrar thal may more easily be concelved than described, the notes 0f busy preparation. Morning carne, ond the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew cllmost frantic. Tbe curiosity of lhe servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helploss ald woman. He seized the opporturiity, with one b0und was out of the room, and jn a moment found him\u017felf ln the apartment where all were near ly assembled. Lord Rutbven was thefirst to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurrled him from the room, speeohless with rage. When an the staircase, Lard Rulbven wbispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember yaur oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister js dishonovred. Women are frajl!\" So saying, he pushed him tawards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vont, had broken a blood-vossel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the pbysician wcls afraid of clgilating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroorn lest Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms os the near approach of death. He deslred his sister's guordians mighl be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Mjss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glullcd tho tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXT RACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESID ENCE, &c.\n\"The world wos all before bim, whcre to choose his place of rest, and Providcnce bis guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago,on board one of his Majesty's vesscls, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of thclt name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo ond vegctablcs aIwclys to be had therc, induce many Britishvessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and mercharitrnen; and thovgh it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Srnyrna, its bourities amply repay for the devialion of a voyage. We landcd; as usual, at the bollom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and mysels took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, wbere we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so namod) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told vs he hod come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival ln hls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; butI did not choose to qujt Mitylene, where I am likely to gct married. He was an odd, 6ut a very good man. The cottago over the hiIl, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old inan in charge of it: he gclve Dominick, lbe wine-trador, six hundred zechines for it,(a6out L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to tbe different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house where ourc0untryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, wh0 conductod us ouer tbe mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all fimply decoratcd: p1ain green-stairied walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrlle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the branche\u017f by moving a spring fixed ln the side of a smalI bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In tho hall stood balf cl dozen English cane chclirs, and an empty boak-case: there wero no mirrors, nor a single painling. The bedchamber had merely a large mattross spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common hed throughout Grcece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble rec ess, formerly, the 0ld man told vs, filled with hooks and papers, which were then in a lorgeseaman's chest in the closel: it was open, but we did not think ovrselves justified in oxaminlng the contonts. Ori the toblet of thc recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roussoav's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiclh; Kot2cbue's novels; Schiller's play of the R0bbers; Mi1ton's Paradise Losl, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from thc Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled wilh mclrginal riotes, written witb o pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was lilerally seribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, ori which also were remarks.\nTbe old man said: \"The lord bad bcen reading these books the evening beforo he sailed,ond forgot to place lhom with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until hls return; for he is so parlicular, that were I to move onething withaul orders, he would frown up0n me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a servicc; and I have the produce os this farm for tbe trouble of taklrig care of it, exccpt twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arinenian who resides iri a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brougbt here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the h ouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paces long and fourteen broad, ond the fluted marblepillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is riow customary in Greciari clrchitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof,surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was couered by a fine Turkey corpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse Iinen. Most of tbc house-tops are thus furnished, as upori them the Greeks pass their evenings in smokirig, drinking light wines, \u017fuch as \"Iachryma christi,\" eclting fruil, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the hau\u017fe, a small streamlet gIided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clvslering together on its borders, and under the shade 0f two large myrtle bushes, a rnarble seot with an ornamenlal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many ofhis evenings clnd nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking ta himself. \"I suppose,\" said the oId man, \"p raying\" for he was very devout, \"and always ottended our church twice a week, bcsides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line 0f rich vineyards led lbe eye to Mount Ca1cla, covered with 0live and myrtle trees in 6loom, arid on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek tompIe appear od in majestie decoy. A small stream issuing fram the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was losl in the woods near the rnountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termlnates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands werc distinctly observed, studding the light bluewave with spots of emerald green. I seldomonjoyed a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless os ta the name os thc person who had resided in tbis romanlic solitude: none knew his riame but Dominick, hif banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I clm suro he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" faid I\u2014\"If I can,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We hod not timc to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we leclrnt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioned elght young girls when he was last upon lhe island, and evcri danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving t hese articles. He also bought o new boot for a fisherman who had lost his awn in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments ta the poor children. In short, he appeared tous, from all we collected, to hove 6een a very ecceritrjc and bonevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper nol to di\u017fclose. He hada most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen wolking on the sea-shore, and he had 6ought her a piano-forle, and taught her himself lhe use of it.\nSuch was the informatjon with which we departed from the peaceful islo os Mitylene; ovrimaginations all on tbe rack, guessing who thl\u017f rambler iri Greeoecould be. He had money it wcls evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities whieh mark pecu liar goniu s. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archltect, a pupil os WYATT'S, who bad been trauelling in Egypt and Greece, \"Theindividual,\" faid he, \"ob0ut whom you are so clnxiouf, if Lord Byron; I mel him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I cllso visiled him al Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had becn some years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every pagc. Decply did we regret n0t having been inore curious in our researches at lhe cottage, but we consoled ourselves witb tho idea of rcturning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believlng it not quite uninteresting, and in justiceto his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse lo associating with human nature, or contri6uting in any way to sooth its sorr0ws, or add to lts pleasures. The fact is directly the reverso, as moy be plainly gathered fromthose Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of tbe heclrt, so eleganlly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bo\u017fom. Tendemess, syinpathy, and charity appear to gulde all his acljons: arid his courting the repose of \u017folitude ls ari additional r eason for markirig him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, arid over whose head Bencvolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a covntryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not afsume a right to give an opinion. Reports are cver to bc reeeived wilh caution, particularly when direoted against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsels before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censurelhe errors of o fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genlus.

In the West it sprecld, with some slight variation, ol1 over Hungary, Poland, Austrla, and Larraine, where the belies existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain porlion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of con\u017fumptions; whllst these human blood-sucker\u017f fattened\u2014arid their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodles, and even from the very pores of tbeir skjnf.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular oase of vampyrifm, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, jn Hungary. It appears, that upon an examinatlon of the c0mmander-in-chief and mclgistrates of lhe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, ahout five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, hod been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiersof the Turkish Servia, he had heen tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. Thjs precauti0n, however, did not prcvent him from becomjrig a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days afler his death and burial,many persons complained of having been lormented by him, arid a deposition was made, that faur person\u017f had been deprived af life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, tho inhabjtants having consulted tbeir Hadclgni, took up the b0dy,and found it (cls is svpp0sed to be usual incases of vampyrjsm) sresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emjtting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having becn thus oblained, tbey resorted to the accustomed reinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to haue cried out as dreadfully as if he had been aljve. This done, they cul offhis head, burned his body, and threw lhe clshes inta his groue. The same measures wore adopted with the corscs 0f those persons who had previously djed from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turri, become agents upon othcrs wh0 survivod thein.\nThe universal belief is, that a pcrson suckedhy a vampyre bocomes a vampyre himsels, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bclilisf.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is bere related, bccause it soems better adapted t0 illustrate the subject of the prosent o6servations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greecc it is consldered cls a sort of punjshment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed lo vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties 0f kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alIuded to in the\"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse s hall fr0m its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the notive place, Andsuck the blood of alI thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet locltbe the bclnqvet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet oxpirc, Shall know the demori for their sire; As eursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flawer\u017f arc wjthered on the stem. But one lhat for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shaIl wrap lhy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her oheek's 1ast tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Wbich freczos o'er lts ljfeles\u017f blue; Then with unhallowed hand shaIl tear The tresses of her yellow hair, 0f which, in lifo a lock when shom Affection's fondesl pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by theo Memorial of thine ogony! Yet with thine own best blood shalI drip; Thy gnashing toolh, clnd haggard lip; Then stalking to lhy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrit\u017f rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed thcln they.\nMr. Southey has also iritroduced in his wild but beautiful p0em of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse os the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represerited as having returned froin thc grave for lhc purp0se of tormenting hlm she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have refulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale cls a complete type of purlty and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long acoount ln his travels of several astonishing cases 0f vampyrism, lo which he pretc-\nnds to hclve 6een an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great wark upon thls subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put fortb some learried djssertations, tcnding to prove it to be a classical, aswell as barbarian error.\nMany curlous arid interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may susfice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to cxplanatiori, and which may riow be concluded by merely remarking, that lhough the term Vampyre is the one in most generol acceptation, there are several athers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happencd that in the midst of the dissipations attcndant upon a London winter, there appeared at tbe voriou\u017f parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, m0re remarkable for his singularities, than hjs rank. He gazed upan the mirth arovnd him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of tbe fair only attracted hif attention, that he might by a look quelI it, and throw fear into th0se breasts where thoughtlessriess reigned. Those who felt lhis sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it aroso: some attributed it t0 the dead grey eye, wbicb, fixing upon lhe object's face, did not \u017feem to penetrate, and at one glarice to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His pecu1iaritief caused himto be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and tbose who hod been accustomed to violent excitemcnt, and now felt tbe welght of ennui, were pleased at hav ing something in their presence capoble of engaging lheir attention. In spite of tho deadly hue of his fac e, which nevor gclined a warmer tint, eitber from the blush of modesty, or from the strong omotion of passion, though its form arid ovtline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attomptedto win his attentions, and gain, at leclst, some morks of what they mlght lerm affection: Lady Morcer, who had beon thc mockery of every monster \u017fhewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, lo attracl bis notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood bef0ro him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still jt fcemed as if they were vnperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudenco was baffled, and she left the field. But tbough the common adultross could nol influonce even theguidance of his eyes, it was not that the female \u017fex wasindifferent to him: yet such was theapparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and inn0cent daughter, that few know he ever addressed hiinself to females. He had, however,the repulation of a winning tongue; arid whether it was that it evori overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he wasas often among those females who form the boost of their sox from tbeir domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, therecame to London a young gontleman of tbe name of Aubrey: he was an orphanleft with an only \u017fister in the pofsession of g reat wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thovght it their duty merely to take care os his forturie, while theyrelinquished the more important charge of his mirid to the care ofmercenclry subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of banour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He beljeved all to sympat-\nhise with virtue, and thovght that uice was thrown in by Providence inerely for the picluresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vestlng as elotbes, which were as warm, but which were botter adapted to the painter's eye by their irrcgular fo1ds and uariovs coloured patches. He lhought, in fine, thclt the dreams of poets were the reclIities af ljfe. He was handsome, srank, and rich: for lbese roasons, upon hi\u017f entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the \u017fame time, by their brighteriing countenance\u017f when he approclched, and by tbeir sparkling eyes, wben he apened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romance of his so1itary hours, he waf stortled at finding, tbat, except in the tallow and wax candle\u017f that flickered, nol srom lhe presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, lherc was no foundation iri real life for clny of that congeries os ple asing pictures and descriptions contained in those volurnes, from whioh he had formed his study. Findirig, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being wc havc above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossjbility of forming an ideo of the characler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observatiori of external objects, than the lacit assent to their exislence, implied by the avoidarice of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this ob jecl into the hero of a romance, arid determined to obsorve lhe offspring of his fancy,rather than lhe person before him. He became acquainted with him, poid him attentions, and so for advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually lcarnt tbat Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon fourid, from the notes of preparatlan in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this fingu1ar character, who, till naw, had only wbetted his eurjosity, he hinted to his guardions, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the yaung to take some rapid steps in tbe career of vice towards putting themselues upon an equality with the aged, and not a11owing them to appear af jf fallen srom the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues ore menlioned as the subjeots of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying thcm on. They oon\u017fented: ond Aubrey immediately mentioning hi\u017f intentions lo Lord Rvthven, was svrprised to receive from him a proposal lo join him. Flattered by such a mork of osteem fromhjm, wha, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepled it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity of sludying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, tbat, though many more os his actions were expased to bis view, the resultsoffered diffcrent conclusions fram the a pparent motives to his conduct.His companiori was prosuse in bis liberallty;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, receivcd from his hand more than enough to rolieve their jmmediale warits. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virluous, reduccd to indigence by the misfortunes ottendant even upon virtue, thal he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sncer\u017f; but when tbe profligato came to ask something, not to reljeve his wants, but to allow him to wallow iri his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was scnt away with rich charily. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importvnity of the vicjous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulnefs os the virtuous indi gerit. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, whicb was slilI more impressed upon his mind: all those vpon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon il, for they were clll either led to the fcaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the rn0st abjecl misery. At Brussels and other towns tbrough wbi ch they passed, Aubreywas surprized ot the apparent eagerness wlth which his companion \u017fought for the cenlres of all fashjonable vice; there be enlered into aIl the spirit os the fara table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagoni\u017ft, arid then hc lost everi more than he gained; but lt was always with the same unchanging face, wilh whjch he gerierally wcltchedthe fociety around: it waf not, however, so when he encovritered the rash youthful nouico, or thc lucklcss falher of a nvmerous family; theri his very wish scemed fortune's law\u2014this oppareril abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled witb more fire than that of the cat whilst dclllying with lhe holf-dead mouse. In every town, ho left the former1y afflucnt youth, torn srom the circle be adorned, cursing, in the solitudc of a dungeon, the fate that hcld drawn him within thereach of lhis fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speoking looks of mute hungry childron, without a single farthjng of hif late lmmense weaIth, wberewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling toble; but immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just sriatchedfrom the convulsive grasp of thc innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capoble os combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity clnd pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day ho boped his friend wauld give him fome opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amldst the varl0us wild and rich scenes 0f nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his ouriosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the c0nstarit excitement of vairily wishing lobreak that mystery, which to his oxalted jmagination 6egan to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey far a time lostsight of his companion; he left him in daily attendanoe upon the morriing circle af ari Italian countess, whilst he went in searcb of the memorials of anothor alrnost desc rted city. Whilsl he was thus engaged, letters orrived from EngIand, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from bis sister, breathing nothing but affection; the other\u017f were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into hls imagination that thore was an evil power residont in his compariion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfuIly vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, roridered his licentious habits m0re dangerous to society. It had been dlscovcred, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, thathis victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pjnnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had n0t scrvpled to cxpose the whole deformity 0f their vicef to the public gaze.\nAubrey det-\ncrmined upon leaving one, whose character had not yel shown a single bright poinl on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposirig, in the mean while, lo walch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstanoes pass by unnotjced. He enter ed into the sarno circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperiencc ofthe daughter of lhe lady whose hovse he chiefly freqvonted. In Itoly, it is seldom thclt an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obligcd to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all bis windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thovgh thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered tho apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions withrespect to lhe lady, informing him cll the same tlme that be was clware of hif being aboutto meet her thclt very night. Lord Ruthven an\u017fwered, that his intentions were sucb as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to mclrry her, mcrely laughed. Aubrey retircd; and, immediately writing a note, to say, thot from that moment he must decline accompanylng his Lordship in the remclinder of their proposed l0ur, he ordered hjs seruant to seek other apartmerits, arid calling upon the m0ther of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard lo her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. Tho assignation was prevcrited. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete as\u017fent to a separation; bul did not hint any fuspicion af his pIans having 6een foiled hy Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greecc, arid crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in tho house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself iri tracing the faded records of ancient glory up0n monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltcring soil or many col0ured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself,exi\u017fted a being,so 6eautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvafs the promised hopeof the saithfvl in Mahomct's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much inind for any one to lhink she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountairi's side, one would have thought the gazeIle a poor type af her beauties; for who would haue exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animalcd nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the onimal suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his searoh after antiquities, and often would the uncorisclous girl, engaged iri the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the wbole beauty 0f hcr form, floating as it were upon the wind, ta the eager gaze of bim, who forgot the letters he had just decyphcrcd upon an almost effaccd tablet, in the contempIation os her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as \u017fbe flitted around, exhibit iri the \u017fun'\u017f ray such delicately brilliant and swjftly fading bues,it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who letescape from his mind thc very object he had before thought of vital importclnce to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why ottempt lo describe charrnswhich all foel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffeeted by crowded drawing-roams and stifling balls. Whilst he drew tbose remains of whicb he wished to preserve a mcmorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects os his pencil, in tracjng the scenes of her native placo; she would then describe to him the circlirig dance uponthe open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, wou1d tell him all the supernaturaI tales of her nurse. Her carnestness and apparent belief af what she narrated, excited the iriterest even os Aubrcy; and often as she lold him the tale of the living vainpyre, who had passed years amidst his frjends, and dearest ties, forcedcvery year, by f eodjng upon the life af a Iovely female to pr0long his exl\u017ftence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attcmpted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasics; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had clt last detected one living among themselves, after several of thejr near relatives and children had heen found marked with lhe slamp of thc fiend's appetitc; and when \u017fhe found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believo her, for lthad been, remarked, that those who had dared to qucstion their exi\u017ftence, always bad \u017fomo proof given, whieh obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detaiIed to him thc troditional oppearance of these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descriptian of Lord Ruthuen; he, however, still persisted in persuading ber, that there could be no truth in hor fears, though at lhe same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all lended to excite a belief in the fupernatvral power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach hiinself more and more to Ianthe; her lnnocence, so conlrasted with all tho affected virtuos af the women amang whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed lhe idea of ayoung man of English habits, marrylng an vneducated Greok girl, still he found hlmself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hjm. He would lear himse1f at timos from her, and, forming a plan for s0meantiquarian research, he would depart, deterrnined not to return untll his object was attoined; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilsl in his mind he retained an iinage thot seemed alone the rightfvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unoonscious of his love, and wa\u017f ever the same frank infclnti1e being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; hut it was beeause \u017fhe had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourjto havnts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragmcnt which had yet escaped the destruetive band of time. She had appealed to ber parents an the suhject of Vampyres, and they both, wilh several present, affirmed their existence, pale wjth horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey dotermined to proeeed upon orie of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when thoy heard the name of the p1aco, theyall at once begged of him not to returri at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler the day had closed, vpon any consideration. They described il cls the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnaI orgies, and denounced the most hoclvy evils as lmpending upori hjm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring tbus to mock a superior, inserrial power, the veryname of which apparerit1y madc their blood freeze, he was si1ent.\nNext inorning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he wof surprised to observe the melancholy face of his hosl, and was concerned to firid that biswords, mocking lhe belies of lhose harrjble fiends, had inspired them with such terror. Whenhe was about to doparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eornestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power os these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. Hewas, howevcr, so occupied in bis research, that he did not peroeive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer c1imatcs, so rapidly gather into a lremeridous mass, and pour alI their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted bis horse, determined to make up by speed for bis delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in t hese southern climates, is almost unknown; jmmediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had odvanced far, the power of the storm was ab0ve\u2014its echoing thundors had scarcely an interval of rcst\u2014its thick heavy rclin forced its way through lhe conopying foliage, whilst the6lue forked lightning seeinod to fall and radjate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was jn the neighbourhaod of a hovel that bardly listed itself up from the rna\u017fses 0f dead leclves arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guido him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the starm. Af he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadsul shriek\u017f of a woman mingling with the \u017ftifled,exultanl mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost vnbroken sound;\u2014he wasstartled: but, roused by the thunder which agoin rolled over hlf head, he, with a sudden effort, forccd opon the door of the hut. He found hiinself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparcntly unperceived; sor, though ho called, still tbe sounds continued, and no notice was tclken of him. He sovnd himself in contact with some one, whom he imme diately seized; when a voice cried,\"Again baffled!\" ta whicb a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: detormined lo seIl hif life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was ljfted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the grourid:\u2014bis enemy thrcw himself upon him, and knecling upon his breast, hcld placed hi\u017f hands up0n his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole lhat gave light in thc day, disturbed him;\u2014he in\u017ftantly rose, arid, loaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in amoment the crashing of the brariches, as ho broke thr0ugh the wood, was rio lon ger heard. Tbe storm was now stil1; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by tho\u017fe without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon thc mud walls, and the thatch loadcd on every individuaI straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they search ed far her who had attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his harror, when the light of the torches oneemore burst upon bim, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought jn a lifeIess corse. He shut hif eyes, hoping thatit wafbut a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the samc form, when he unclosed lbem, stretchod by his side. There was no colour upori her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stllIness about her foce thal seemed almost as attaohing as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon ber neck and breast was b lood, and upan her throat were the marks of teelh having opened the vein:\u2014to this the inen pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter waf quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid bythe side of her who had lately been to him lhe object of so mclny bright and fairy visions, now falleri with the flower os life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts wore\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he heId almost unconsciou\u017fly in his hand a naked dagger os a particvlar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had beeri erigaged in the search of her whom a mother bod mis\u017fed. Their lomentable crie s, as they approachod the city, forewarned the paront\u017f of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe lheir grief wou ld bc impossible; but wben they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Avbrey, and pojnt ed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-bcarted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wilh a most violont fever, and was often de1iriou\u017f; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable eombjnation he soemed to beg of his former companion to spare thebeing he loved. At othcr timos he wauld imprecato maledictions up0n hls head, and curse him a\u017f her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time t0 arrive at Athens, ond, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediatelyplaced himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis delirium, he wos horrisied and startled at the sight of him wh0se image he had now c0mbinedwith that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rutbven, by bis kind w0rds, implying almost repenlclnce sor the fault thot had caused their separation, and still more by lhe attentian, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to hls presence. His lordship seemed quile changed; he no longer appeclred that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again grodually retired into the same ftate of mind, and Aubrey pereeived no differe nce from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of rnalicious exultalion playing upon his lip\u017f: he knew not why, but tbis srnile hclunted him. During the lclst stage of tbe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently ongaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breezc, or in inarking theprogress of tho\u017fe orbs,circljng, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he a ppeared to wish to clvoid the eyos of all.\nAubrey's mind, by lhis sh0ck, was much weakeried, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have sled for ever.He was now as mucb a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul much as he wished for solilude, his mind c0uld not find it in thc neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruiris he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if hc sought it in the woods, her llght ftep would appear waridering arnidft the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; thon suddenly turning raund, wovld show, ta his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assaciations in his mind. He pro posed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himfelf bound by the lender cclre he had taken of hiin during his illness, that they should vislt those parts of Greeee neitber had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a reeollection covld be attached: bul though they thus hastened from plaee to place, yet they seemed not to hoed what lhey gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, 6ut they gradually began to \u017flight these reports, whichthey imagined were only tbo inuentiori of individuals, whose interest it was to oxcite the generosity of thase whom they defended fr0m pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one accasion they travelled with anly a few guclrds, more to serve as guides than as a defenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at tbe bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouririg precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; sor scarcely were the wh0le of the party engaged inthe narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets closo to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had lest them, and, placing tbemselves bohind rocks, hod begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating lheir exainple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: hut ashamed of being tbus detairied by a foe, who with insvlting shouts bade them advonce,clnd being exposed to unresisting s1aughter, is any of the robbers fhould climb abovc and take thom in tbe rear, they determined at once lo rvsh forward in search of tbe eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, whicb brought him to theground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, rio longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robhers' faces around him\u2014hi\u017f guards having, up0n Lord Ru tbven's being wounded, iminediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey saon induced them to convey his wounded friend lo cl neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon cl ran\u017fom, ho was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being conlent merely to guard the entranee till their comrade should return with the promlsed sum, for whlcb he had an order. Lord Rutbven'f strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortifjcatiori ensued, and death seemed cldvclncing with hasty steps. Hls conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mind became opparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer hi\u017f assistance with more than usual earneslness\u2014\"Assist ine! you moy savo me\u2014y0u may do more than that\u2014I mean not my lise, I heed tbe death of my existenco as litlle as lhat of the passing day; but you may savo my honour, your sriend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell mehow? I wauld do ony thlng,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but littlc\u2014my life ebbs apaee\u2014I canriot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal a1l you know of me, my horiour were freo from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for s0me time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himse1f with exullant vlolence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by oll your nature fears, swear that, for a year anda day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatcver may happen, or whatever you may soe. \"\u2014Hls eyes seemed bursting from tholr soeket\u017f: \"I swear!\" said Avbrey; he sunk laughing upon his pi1low, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retircd to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering came over him, as if from the pre sentiment of somethirig horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left tbe corpse, when a robber met him, and informed hiin tbat it was n0 longer there, having been conveyed 6y him\u017felf andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neigbbouring mount, aceording to a promise thcy had given bis lardship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rase after his death. Avbrey astonished, and taking severa1 of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace af eitbcr the eorpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed oul tho ideritical rock on whieh they had laid the hody. For a time his mind was bewildered in c0njectures, but he at laft returned, convinced that they had buried tbe corpse for the sakc of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in whjch he had rnet with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to heighten lhal superstitious rnelanch0Iy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved lo leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him lo Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himselsiri arranging those effeets he had with himbelonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other thing\u017f there was a case conlaining several weapons of ofsence, more or less ada pted to ensure the declth of tho victjm. There were s everal daggers ond ataghans. Whilst tvrning tbern over, and examining their curiaus forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamenled in the same style as the daggor discovered in the fcltal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he fovnd the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when hediscovered that it filted, thavgh peculiarly shaped, the sheath he he1d in his hand. His eyef seemed to need no further certolnty\u2014they seemod gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet \u017flill he w ished to disbelieve; but the particular form, thc same uaryjng tints upon the haftand sheath werc alike in splendour on both,clnd left no roorn far doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and an his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were coriceming lhe lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their forlune ruiried, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey'smind becarne almost broken under so mclny repeated horrors; he was afraid tbat this lady had fallen a victim lo the destroyer of Ianthe.He becclme morose arid silent; and his only occupation consisted in vrging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save tbe life of some one he hold dear. He arrived at Ca1ais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hasteried to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momenl, appeared to lose, in the ombraces and coresses of his sister, all memory of the paft. If she before, by her infanline earesses, bad gained hi\u017f affection, now thal the woman began to appear, she was still more attaohing as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gajns the gaze and opplause os the drawing-room assemblies. There was nonc of that light brilliancy whlch only exists in the heated atmosphere os a cr owded apartmcnt. Her 6lue eye was riever lit up by the levity os the mind beneath. There was a melancho1y charm about it which did not seem to orise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul consciovs of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, whlch strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014il was sedalo and pensjve. Wben alone, her face was never brightenod by the smile of joy; but whon her brather breatbed to her his asfectlon, and would iri ber presence forget those griefs she know destroyed his rest, who w0uld bave exchclrigod her smile for that of lhe voluptuary? It seemed as if those oyes,\u2014lhat face were then playing in the lightof their ownnative sphere. She was yet only eighleen, and had n0t been pres-\nented to the world, it having been thovght by her gvardlans more fit that her presentation should bc delayed until her brolher'\u017f return from lhe co ntinent, when he might be ber pralector. It was naw, therefore, resolved that the riext drawing-room, whjch was fast clpproaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would ralhcr bave remained ln the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowcred him. He eould not fcel intorost about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when hls mind had been so torn by the events hc had witnessed; but be determined lo sacrisice his own comfort to tbe protection of his flster. They soon arriued in town, and pro-\npared for the ncxt day, which had boen announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawjng-r0om had riot been held for a long tlme, and all who wero anxiaus to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened th ither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he waf standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that tho first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddonly seized by the arm, and a voice he recogn ized too well, sounded iri hls ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast hiin, wheri he perceived, at a little distonce, tbe same flgure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his firsl ontry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear lheir wei ght, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw bimself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried \u017fteps, and fixed his harids up0n his head, as is he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstclnces started up in dreadful array\u2014thc dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not bel ieve it possible\u2014tbe dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagincltion had eonjured up lhe imagc bis mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be reol\u2014he determinod, therefore, to go again inta society; for tbough he attempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon hif lips, and he couId not fucceed in gairiing insormation. He went a few nights after wilh his sistcr to lhe assembly of a near relatiori. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gaue himself up to his awn devovring tbougbts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roufed himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrovnded by severa1, apparently in earnest conversalion; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested to move, turned round, arid revealed to him tho\u017fc features he m0st abhorred. He sprang forward, seizcd bis sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the slreet: al the door he found himfelf impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while be was engaged in passing them, he again heard tbat voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, saon reached home.\nAu6rcy became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subiect, how much more completely was it ongrossed, now that thc certainty of tho monster'sliving again pressod upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had cavsed his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hisoath startled hiin;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst oll he held dear, and not avert itsprogress? His very sistermight havc been touchedby bim. But even if he were to break his oath, and discl0se his susplcions, who would believe him? He thougbt of employing his own hond to free the world from such a wrelch; but deoth, be remcmbered, had beon already mocked. For days he remained ln thjs state; shut vp iri his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her soke, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stilIness and folitude, he lefl hjs house, roamed fr0m street to slreet, anxious to fly that irnage which haunted hirn. His dress becclme ncglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to thc midnighl damps. He was no longer to he recognized;at first he retvrned with the everiing to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever faligve overtook him. His sister, anxious forhis s afety, employed people lo follow him; but they were s0on distanced by hiin who fIed from a pursuer swlftcr than any\u2014from thought. His conduot, however, suddenly changed. Struck with lhe ideo that he left by his absence the whoIe of his friends, with a fiend amongst thein, of whose preserice thcy were unconscious, he determined t0 enter again into saciety, clnd watch him closely, anxlous to forewarri, in spite of his oath, all wham Lord Ruthven approached witb intimaey. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookswcre so striking, his i nward shudderings so visible, that his sister was al lclst obliged to beg of him to ab\u017ftain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remaristrclnce provod uriavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearlng tbat hls mind was becomirig alieriated, they thougbt it high time to resuine agairi that truft which had been before irnposed vpon thein by Aubrey's parentf.\nDefirous of saving hirn from the lnjuries and sufferings he had d aily encountered in his wanderings, andos preventing him from exposing to tbe gerieral eye those marks of what they oonsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in thc bouse, and take ooristant care of him. He hardly appeared to riotlce it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incohcrence became at last so great, that be was confiried to his chambor. Tbere he would oflen lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emociated, hls eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the anly sign os affoction and recol1ection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of hif sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizirig her hands, with looks tbat scverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch hirn. \"Oh, do nat toucbhim\u2014is your love for me is aught, do not go near blm!\" When, however, fho inquired to whoin he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whenceriot even she could rouse him. This lastod rnany inonths: graduaIly, however, as the yeor was pas\u017fing, hif incaherences hecame lefs frequent, and bis mirid threw osf a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardiorisobserved, thclt several ti mes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then sinile.\nThe time had riearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the y ear, ane of his gvardians entering his room, began t0 conv erso with his physician upon the meIancholy circumstanceof Aubrey's being in s0 awful a situation, when hi\u017f sis ter was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of thjs mark of retuming iritellect, of whicb they feared he bad hoen deprived, they mentioned lhe name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl wham he hadmet with in sociely, Aubrey seemedpleased, and astonished them still more by his cxpressing his intentiori to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to sec bis sister. Tbey answered not, hut in a few minutes his sister was with him. He wos apparently agoin capa6le of beirig affected by the influence of her 1ovely \u017fmile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the seelings af affeclion. He b egan t0 speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her vpon hermarriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evory accomplishment; wheri he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; 0pening it, what was his surprise at behalding the features of the monster wha had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, ond trampled it under f0ot. Upon her asking hjm why he thus destroyed the resem6lance of hor future husband, he looked as if he djd not understarid her\u2014then seizing her honds, and gazing on her wilh a frantic expression of countonance, he bade her swear thot she would never wed this m0nster, for he\u2014 Bvt he cauld not advance\u2014it seeined af if lhat voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lhe moanlime tbe guardians and physiclan, who had heard the whole, and thovght this was but o return of his disorder, entered, and forclrig him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave hirn. He fell upon his kneos to them, he imp1ored, be bcgged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity lhcy imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and rotired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had beori refused with every one else. Wheri he heard af Aubrey's ill heclllh, he readily underftood himself to be the cause of it; 6ut when hc learned that he was dcemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this lnformation. He hastened to the hovfe of his former companiori, arid, by constant atteridarice, and the pretence af great affection for the brother and interest in hls fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dangcrf and toils to reeount\u2014could fpeak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy wjth any boing on the crowded eartb, save with her to whom be addressed himself;\u2014could te1l how, since he know her, his existence,hcld begun to seemworthy of preseruation, jf it were merely that he might li\u017ften to her soothing acoents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, thclt he gained her affectjons. The title of the elderbronoh fallirig at length to him, he obtoined an important embassy, which served as an excvse for bastening the marriage, (in spite af her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place thevery day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain.He askod for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjvring her, as she valued her own happiness, ber own honour, and the hanour os tho\u017fe now in tbe grave, wha orice held her in their arms as their hope and tbe hope of their hause, to delay but for o few hours that marriage, on which he denaunced lhe mast heavy cvrse\u017f. The seruants promised they would deliver it; but giving lt to the physician, he thought lt bettcr not to harass any more the mind of Miss A ubroy by, what he considered, the ravings af a maniac. Nigbt passed ori without resl to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easilybe conccived than described, the notesof busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke vpon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the cuslody os an helpless o1d woman. Ho seized the opportunity, wlth one bound was out of the rooin, and in a momont favnd himself in the aparlinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediotelyapprooched, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechlesf with ragc. When on tbe staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if nol my bride t0 day, your sister is dishonoured. Women aro frai1!\" So saying, he pushcd hlm t owards his attendants, wbo, roused by the old womon, had come in \u017fearch of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding uerit, had broken a blaod-vesseI, and he was conveyed to 6ed. Tbis wa\u017f not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The mclrriage was solemriized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the esfusion of blood produced symploms of the near approach of death. He desired his fister'f guclrdians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be reIated composedly what tbe reader hos pcrused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Mifs Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, clnd Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of cl VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT DF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &o.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence hisguide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greoian Archipelago, on boord one 0f his Majesty's vesse1s, in the year 18l2, we put into tho harbour of Mitylene, in tbe island of that name. The beauty of this plclce, arid lhe certain supp1y of cattle and vegetahles always to be had there, induce manyBriti\u017fh vefsels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmon; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, jts bountles amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, ot the b0ttom of the bay, and whilst tho mcn werc employed in watering, and thc purser bargaining for cattle with thc natives, the clergyinan and myself took arclmble to lbe cove called Homer's Scbool, and other pIaces, where we had been besore. On the brow af Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greekas our guido, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who lest the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me af a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I dld not ehoose t0 quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. Tbo cottageover the hill, facing the river, belongs lo him, and he has left an old mari in oharge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zecbines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not coristanlly; for he salls in his felucca very often t0 the difforent islands.\"\nThis acoount excited ourcurio\u017fity uery much, and we lost no tiine in hastening lo the hovse where our c0untryinan had resided. We wore kjndly receivod by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on thc grovnd-floor\u2014ari entrance hall, a drawirig-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, wjth clspacious o1oset annexed. They were all sjmply decorated: plain green-\u017ftained walls, marble lables on either side, a largo myrtle in the ccnlre, and a small sountajn heneath, wbich could be made to play tbrough the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small br0nze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood hals a dozen English cane chclirs, arid an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. Tbe bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pjllow\u2014thc common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fllled wilh books and papers, whicb were then in a large seaman's chest in the closct: ll was open, but we did not tbink ourselues ju\u017ftified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recesf lay Voltaire's, Shakfpeare'f, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins 0f Empjres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Kl0pstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's n0vels; Schi1ler's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italjan edition, printed at Parina in 1810; \u017feveral small pamphlets from lhe Greek press at Constantjnople, mucb tom, but no English book of any descriplion. Most os these books were filled wilh marginol notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. Tbe Mefsiah was literally scribbled all ouer, and marked with slips of paper, on which alsowere remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening bcfore he sailed, and sorgot lo place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his relurn; for he is so parlicular, that were I to move one thlng without orders, be would frown upon mo for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did hjin a \u017fervice; clnd I have the produce of this sarm for the trouble of laking care of it, except twenty zechjnes whioh I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the waod, and wh0m the lord brought here from Adrionople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearanee of the house externolly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the flvted marble pilIars with black plinths and fret-work corniccs, (as it is now customary in Grecian architectvre,) were considerably higher than the roof. The raof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath ari awning of strong coarse linen. Most 0f the hovse-tops are tbus furnishcd, as upan them thcGreeks pass their evenings in smokjng,drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, ond enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered tho houso, asmall streamlet glided away, grapef, oranges and limes wero clustering together on its borders, and under the shade 0ftwo lorgc myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whioh we were told, tho lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from tbis seat was whclt may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek tempIo appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam issuirig from the ruins descendcd in broken casc-\nades, until it was lost in lhe woods near thc mountain's 6a\u017fe. The sea smoolh as glass, and an horlzon unshodowed by a single cloud, terminates the uiew in front; and a little an the left, thr0vgh a vista of loftychesnut and palm-trees, sevcralsmall islarids were distinctly observed, ftudding the light blue wave wlth spots os emerald grecn. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirios wero fruitless as to the name of tbc person who hcld resided in this romantic soljtude: none knew his name but Domi nick, hjs banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our corid uetor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And carinot yov tell, old frjend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We bad not time to vifit tbe Armenian, 6uton our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eighl young girls whcn hc was last upon the island, and everi danced with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses lo others, and cotton and silk to the girls wha live by weaving these orticles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherrnan who hod lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Grcek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he clppeclrcd to us, fram all we collected, lo have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Dne circvmstance we learnt, which our old frlend at the coltage thougbt proper n0t to disclose. Hehad a most beautifvl daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shorc, and he had hought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSucb was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle os Mitylene; our imagjnations all on the rack, gue\u017fsing who this rambler in Greeoe could be. He hadmoney it wcls evident: he had philanthropy os disposition, and all those eccentricities which rnark peculiclr genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, o pupil of WYATT'S, wbo had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"Tbe iridividval,\" said he, \"a6out whom yau are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on tbe island of Tenedos, and I also visited bim at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some year\u017f from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized tho reclufe of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regrot not hoving been more eurious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this stateinent, belioving it not quite uninleresting, and in justice to his lord\u017fhip's good name, whicb has been grossly slandcred. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with hvman nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be p1ainly gathored from these little anecdotes. All the siner feelingsaf the heart, so elegantly depictcd in hls lordship's poems, seem to have thejr seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympalhy, and charity appear to guide all his actionf: arid his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him a\u017f a bejng on whose heart Religion hatb set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trclits\" witbout feeling proud of him as a eountryman. With respect to hjf loves or pleasvres, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reportf are ever to be roccived with oaution, particularly when directed against man's m0rcll integrily; and he who dares justify himself before lhat awful trihunal whore all must appear, alone may censure the orrars of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's charocter is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart ond self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreot.","13":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did nat, however, extend itself to lhe Greeks until after the establisbment of Christiariity; and it has only assumed its pre\u017fent form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at whieh time, the ldea becoming prevalent, that a Latiri body could nol c0rrupt if buried in their territory, it graduaIly increased, and farmcd the subject of many wonderful storjes, stjll extclnt, of tho dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the Wc\u017ft jt spread, wlth some sllght variation, alI over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nighlly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedilydied of consvmptianf; whilst lhese human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to \u017fuch a state of repletion, as to cause tho blaod to slow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from lhc very pores of their skins.\nIn the London JournaI, of Marcb, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accounl of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred clt Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appears, that up0n an cxamination of the commander-in-chlef and mogistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, abaut five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arriold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassavia, on tho frontiers of the Turkish Sorvia, he had boen tormented by a vompyre, but had found a way lo rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's gravo, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becorning a vainpyre himsolf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, rnany persons complairied of having been tormented by bim, and a deposition was made, that four persons hcld been deprived of life by his ottacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, taok up the body, and found it (os is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely sree srom corrupti0n, and emitting at the moutb, nose, clnd ears, pure and f1orid 6lood. Proof having been thus 0btained, they resorted to the aceustomed remedy. A stake was driveri cntirely thr0ugh the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cvt off his head, burned his body, and lhrew the ashes into hi\u017f grove. The same mea\u017fures were adopted wjth lhe corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should,in their turn, become agents vpon otherswho survived them.\nThe universal belief js, thclt a person \u017fucked by a uampyre becoines a vainpyrc himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChlef bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, beccluse it seerns better adapled to illustrate the subject of lhe preserit observcltions than any other instance which cauld be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceasedis not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal uisitationf solely to lhose beings he loued most while upon earth\u2014lhofe to wham he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A suppofition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre \u017fent, Thy corse \u017fhall frorn its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natjvo place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathc the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victjms, ere they yot expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursirig thco, tbou cursing them, Thy flowers are w ithered on the stem. But one thclt for thy crime muft fall, The yaungest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee wilh a father's name\u2014 Thal word shall wrap thy heart in f1ame! Yel thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014hcr eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must ulew Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of ber yellow hair, Of which, in life a lockwhen shorn Affection's fondesl pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnclshing tooth, clnd haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also intraduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, wha is represerited as hauing returned from the grave for the purpofe of tormenting himshe bestloved whilst in exist-\nence. But tbis cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her 1ife, she being pourtrayod througbout tho whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracious Taurnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vamp yrism, to which he pretends to haue been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subje ct, besides a variely of onecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrativo of its effects, hos put forth some leamed dissertatioris, tending to prove it to be a classicaI, as well as borbarian err0r.\nMany curiouf and iriteresting notices on this singularlyhorriblc superstition might be added; though the present may suffiee for the Iimils of a note, neoessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be concludod by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are soveral others synonymous with lt, made u\u017fe of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brouco1oka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened lhat in tbe inidst of the dissi-\npations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularitie\u017f, than his rank. He gazed upori the mirth clround him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attrclcted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessncfs reigned. Thosc who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arase: some altributed it to thedead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward w0rking\u017f of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a loaden ray that weighed upon the fkin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every hou\u017fe; all wished to see him, and those who bad bcen accustomed to violenl excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleosed at having something in their presence capable of engaging their altention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warinertint, eilher from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emoti0n os passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of lhe female hunters after n0taricty attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, at least, some marks of what tbey might term affectlon: Lady Mercer, who had beeri the mockery of every monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marriage, tbrew herself in bis way, and did all but put on the dress of a mouritebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it scemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudenee was baffled, and she left the field. But though lhe c0mmon adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex wcls indifferent to him: yet fuch was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife ond innocent daughter, that few knowhe ever addrcssed himself to females. He had, however, the repulation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even ouercame the dread of his singular character, or that they weremoved by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who sorm tho boast af their sex from their dome\u017ftic virtues, as among those who sully it by lheir vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: be was an 0rphan 1eft wilh an anly sister in the possession os great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in chi1dhood. Lefl cllso to himsclf by guardians, who thought it thelr duly meroly to take caro of his fortune, while they relinquisbed the more jinportant charge of bis mlrid to the carc of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feoling of horiour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprcntices. He believed al1 to sympclthise with virtue, and thovght that vice was lhrown in by Providence mere1y for tbe pieturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thovght that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He thought, in flrie, that the drearns of poets were lhe realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into thc gay cireles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languisbing or romping favourites: the daugbters at the same tjme, by their brigbtening counlenances when he approached, and by their sparkling oyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into folse notions of his talents clnd hi\u017f merit. Attacbed cls he was to the romance of his salilary hours, he was start1ed at finding, that, exeept in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from warit of snuffing, there was n0 foundotion iri real life for clny of that congeries of pleasing pietures and descriptions c0ntained in those volvmes, from whioh he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish hls dreams, when tbe extraordinary being we have above described, orossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibllity of formirig an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gclve few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari the taclt asserit to their existe nee, implied by tbe avoidance of their c0nlact: allowing his imagination to picture every thirig lhat flattered its propensity t0 extravagant ideas, he soon formcd this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the affspring of his fancy, ratber thari the person beforo him. Hc beoame aequainted with him, paid him clttentions, and so far cldvclnced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven'\u017f affairs were embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of pr cparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gainirig some inforination respecting this singular character, who, till now,had on1y whetted his cvriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, whjch for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon cln equality wjth the aged, and not allowing thern to appeor as if fallen srom the skies, wheneuer \u017fcandalous intrigues are menti oned as the subjects of pleasantry or af praise, according to the degree of skjIl shewn in carrying them on. They oonsented: and Aubrey immediatoly mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to reccive from him a proposal to join him. FIattered by \u017fuch a mark of esteem from him, who, apparenl1y, had nothing in coinmori with other men, he gladly accepted it, and ln a fow days they hcld passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studylng Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found, that, tbough many more os his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to hi\u017f conduct. His oompanion was profvsc in his liberalily;\u2014the idlo, the vagabond, and the beggar, received srom his hand more tban cnough to reljeve thelr immedlate wants. But Aubrcy could not avoid remarking, lhal it was not upon the vlrtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant euen upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer\u017f; but when the profligate came to ask something, not lo relieue his wants,but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he wos sent away with rich charity. This was, however, altributed by him to lhe greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There wos orie cireumstance about the charity of hi\u017f Lordship, which was slill more impressed upon his mind: al1 those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were aIl either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brusfels and other towns through which tbey passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparcnt eagerness with which hls companion sought for the contres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he bctted, arid always gainbled wilh succesf, except where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and lhen he lostcven more than he gained; but it was always witb the samo vnchangingface, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, sa when he encountered thc rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his vory wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of inind was laid aside, and his eyes sparklcd with more fire than tbat of the cat whllst dclllying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youtb, torn from lhe oircle he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeori, the fate tbat had drawn him within the reach of this fiond; whilst rnany a fathor sal frantjc, arnidst the speoking looks of mute hurigry children, without a single farthing 0fhis late immense wealth, wherewith lo buy even sufficiont to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from lhe gambling tablc; but immedialely lost, to the ruirier of rnclny, the last gilder he had just snatched from tho convulsive grasp of lhe innocenl: this might but be the resvlt of a certaln degree of knowledge, whieh was not, however, cclpable of combating the cunning of the more experien ced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to hif friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasuro which proved the ruin of al1, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amidst lhe various wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwclys the samc: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosily, he obtained rio greater gratiflcation from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break thot mystery, which ta his excllted imaginatiori began to assurne tbe appeararice of somelhing supernatural.\nThey s0on arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of bif companion; he left him in daily atlendance upon the morning circle of ari Italian countess, whilst he went in search os lhe memorials of another almost desertcd city. Whllst be was thus engaged, letters arrivod from England, which he opened witb eager impatience; the firsl was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the othors were from his guardians, the latter astonlshed hjm; is it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power reslderit in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leauing his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for thot the possession of irresistible powers of seductjon, rendered bi\u017f licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, lhat his conternpt for the adultres\u017f had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, lo enbance his gratification, that bis victim, tho partnor of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinnacle of unsullied vlrtuc, down to the lowest abyss of irifamy and degradation: in fine, tbat all thoso females whom hc had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, bad, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole def ormity of their vices to lhe pub1ic gaze.\nAubrcy determined uporileaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point ori which to rost the eye. He resoIvod to invent some plavsible pretcxt for aband0ning him altogotber, purposlng, in the mean while, to watch bim more closely, and to let no slighl oircumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soori perceivod,that his Lordship was erideavouring to work upon the inexperience of the doughter of tbe Iady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is soldom thclt an unmorried female is mel with in society; he waf theresore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye sollowed him in oll his windirigs, and soori discovercd that an assigriation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the rvin of an inn0cent, thougb thoughtle\u017fs gjrl. Losing no lime, he entered the apclrtment of Lord Ruthven, and ahruptly asked him his intentions wlth respecl to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his belng about lo meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answercd, lhat his intentions were such as he svpposed clll w0vld havc upon such on occasiori; and upon being pressed whether he lritended t0 marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, irnmediately writing a riote, to say, that from that moment he must decline aceompanying his Lordship in the reinainder of lhejr proposedtour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and callirig upon the mother of the lady, informed her of aIl ho kncw, nol only wllh regard to her daughter, 6utalso concerning tbe charaeler of his L0rdshjp. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rutbuen next day merely sent hif servclnt to notify his complete assent to a separcltian; bvt did not hint any suspicion of his plans havlng heen foiled by Au6rey'f interposllion.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towardf Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, s0on found himself at Athens. Hc then fixed his residenee in thc hou\u017fe of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the fclded records os ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling lhe deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering \u017fojl or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beclutiful and delicate, that she m ight have formed the mode1 for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of thc faithful in Mahoinet'f paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for ariy 0ne to think \u017fhe could belong to those wbo had no souls. As she danced up0n the plain, or trjpped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would hove exchanged her eyc, apparontly the eye os animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suiled but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unc0n\u017fcjous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floatlng as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gazo of him, who fargot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in thecantemplation of hor sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses folling, as sho flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicotely brilliant and swiftly fading huef, it might well excuse lbe forgetfulnefs of the antiquar y, wbo let escape froin his mirid the very object he had befare tho-\nught of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousariias. But why attempt lo describe charms whichall feel, butnone can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawlng-roorns and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished lo preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watoh the magic effect\u017f of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing iri her infancy; and then, turning t0 svbjects that bad evidently made a greater irnpression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural talef of her riurse. Hcr earnestness and apparent belicf of what she narrated, excitod the inlereft cven of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and doarest tief, fo rced cvery year, by feedingupon thc life os a louely fernale to prolong his oxistence sor thc ensving months, bis blood would run cold, whilst he atteinpted to lclugh ber out ofsuch jdle and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe cited to him the naines of old men, who had at last detectcd one living amang lhemselves, aster several os their near relatiues and children had beeri found marked with the stamp of tho fiend's appetite; and when she sound him so inoredulous, she begged os him to believe her, for it hadbeen, remarked, that those who haddared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbrcaking, to oonfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthveri; he, howeve r, slill persi\u017fted in persuading her, that there could be no truth iri her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidcnces which had all tended to excitc a belief in the supernaturol power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himfelf more and more to Ianthe; hcr innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hi\u017f heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari uneducated Greek girl, slill be sound himseIf more andmore attached to the aIm0st falry formbefore him. He wouId tear himsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined nat to retum until his object wcls attairiod; but he always found it impossible to fix his atte-\nnt ion vpon the ruins around him, whilsl in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rlghtful p0ssessor of his thougbts. Ianthe waf unconsci0us of his love, and was ever the sclme frank infantile being he had first known. She cl1ways seemed to part from hirn with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one witb whom she could visit her favourite haunts, wbilst hcr guardian was occupied in skotching or unc0vering some fragment which had yet esoaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey determined to proceed vpon one of hi\u017f excursions, which was to detain him for a few hovrs; wheri they heard the name of the placc, they all at once hegged of him not to rcturn at night, as he must necessarily pass through o wood, wbere no Groek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considera tion. They described it as the resort of tho vampyres ln their nocturnal orgjes, and denounced the moft heauy evils as impending upon him wha dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw tbem \u017fhvdder at his darlng thus to mock o superior, infernal power, the very naine of whichapparently made thcir blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext inorning Aubrey set ofs upon his excursion unattendcd; he wcls surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had infpired them withsuch terrar. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the \u017fide of his horse, and earnestly begged af him to return, ere night allowed the powcr of these belngs to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-lighl would so0n end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer cliinotes, so rapidly gather into atremendous ma\u017fs, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counlry.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his h0rse, determined to make up by speed for hif delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southernclimatos, is almost unkn0wn; immediately the svn sets, night begins: and ere he had adva-\nnced far, the power of lhe storm was above\u2014its echoing thundershad scarcely an interval of rest\u2014ils thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopyirig soliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse toak frjght, and he wos carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fotigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, thclt he was in lhe neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself vp from the masscs of dead leavos and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheIter from the pelting of the storm. As he approachod, the thunders, for a mornent silent, a1lowed him to hear tho dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exultant mockery of a laugb, continued in one almost unbro keri sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which agairi rolIed over his head, he, with o sudden eff-\nort, sorced operi the door of the hul. He faund himself in utler darkness: the sourid, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceiued; for, thougb he cal1ed, sti1l the s0unds coritinued, and no notice was taken as him. He found hiinself in coritact with sorne one,whom he immediately seized; when o uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whlch a loud laugb succeeded; and he felt himsclf grappled by one whose stren gth seemed superhuman: determined lo sell his life as dearly af he could, he struggled; but it was invain: he was lifted from his seet arid hurled with enorm0us force against thc ground:\u2014his cnemy threwhimself upon him, and kneeling upon his breaft, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetraling through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly r0se, and, leaving hi\u017f prey, rufbed through the door, and in cl moment the crasbing os tbe branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablc of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; tbe light of lheir torches fell vpon the mud walls, and the tbalch loaded on every indiuidual straw wlth heavy flakes of soot. At the defire of Aubrey lhey searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches orice more bvr\u017ft upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress hrought in a lifelesf corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori arising from hls disturbed imaglnation; but he again saw lhe sarne form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no calour upon hcr cheek, not even vpon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face lhat seemed alinost as attaehing as the life that once dwelt lhero:\u2014up0n her neck and breast was blood, and up0n her throat were the marks of teeth having op oned the vein:\u2014to this lhe men pointed, cryjng, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qulckly formed, and Aubrey was laid by lhe side of hcr who had lately been to hjm the object os so many bright and fajry vjsions, now faIlen with the fIower 0f life thol had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts were\u2014his rnind was benumbed and seemed to \u017fhun reflection, and take refuge in vacclncy\u2014he held olinost unconsciously in his hand a naked daggor of a particulclr coristruction, which had been fou nd in tho hut. They were soon met by different parties who bad been engaged lri tbe search of her wh0m a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To descrlbe their grief would be impossible; hut when they ascertained the cause of thelr child's death, they looked at Aubrey, andpointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; 6oth died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was sejzed with a most violent sever, arid wcls often delirlous; in these iriteruals he w0uld call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combjnation he seemed lo beg of his foriner coinpanion to spclre the being he loved. At ather times he would imprecate maledictions upan his bead, and curse him as her dostroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this tjme lo arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state os Aubrey, iminediately placed himself in the same house, and becclme his oonstant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis dcliriuin, he was horrified and ftartled at the sight of him whose imclge he had now combined wilh that of aVornpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying olmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separalion, and still more by the attention, anxiety, orid care whieh he showed, soon reeonciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ehanged; he no longer appeared thclt apathetjc bcing who hcld so astonished Aubrey; hut as soon as his convalefoence began to be rapid, be again gradually retired into the same state os mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprjsed ta meet his ga2e fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultatiori playing upon his lip\u017f: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage af the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apporeritly engaged in watching the tidelesf waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking lhe progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless svn;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the oycs of all.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, was much weakened, and that elasticily of spirit which had oncc so distinguished him now seemed to havo fled forever. He was now as mvcb a lover of \u017folitude and silence as Lord Rulhven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he saught it amidst tho ruins he had formerly frequentod, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in lhe wo0ds, her light step would appcar wandering amidst the undcrwood, in quest os the modest violet; lhon suddenly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale faco and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every seature of which crcaled such bitter assooialions iri his mind. He prop0sed to Lord Ruthven, to whorn he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his lllness, that they should visit tbose parts of Greece neither had yet soen. They travelled in every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: bul though they thu\u017f hast-\nened from place to placc, yet they seemed riol to hoed what they gazed upon. They heard much os robbers, but they graduaIly began to sljght these reports, which they imagined were only the inuention os indiuiduals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dclngers. In consequcnce of thus negleoling the advice of the inhclbitants, on one occasion they trauelled with only a few guards, mare to scrve as guides than as a defen ce. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at tbe bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock broughl down from thc neighbouring prccipices, they had reason to reperit their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling 0f bullets close to their heads, and 6y lhe echoed report of several guns. In an irislant their guards had left them, clnd, placing themselves hehirid rocks, bad begun to fire in lhe direction wherice tbe report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, re tired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile:bul ashamed of belng thus detained 6y a foe, who with insulting shouts bade tbem advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of tbe ro6bersshould climb above and take them in the rear, theydetermined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to bis assjstance; and, no longer heeding lhe contest or his own peril, was soon svrprised by seeing the rob6ers' faces around him\u2014hls guards hauing, upon Lard Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surreridored.\nBy promifes of great reward, Aubrey soon indueed them to corivey his wounded frierid to a rieighbouring cabin; and hauing agreed upon a ransom, he was no more djsturbed by tbeir presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for wbich he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strenglh rapldly decreased; in two days mortificationensued, arid death seeined advancirig with hasty stops. His conduct and appeararicc had not changed; he seemed as unconfcious of pain cls he had been of the objecls obouthim: but towords the close of the last evening, his mind became appareritly unoasy, and his eye often fixed uponAubrey, who was induoed to ofser his assistclnco with mare than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist mc! you may \u017fave me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed lhe death os my existencc as litlle as that of the passing day; but yau may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any lhing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014bvt if you wovld conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death wcro unknowri for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violerice, \"Swcarby all your sovl reueres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death lo any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockels: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; hc sunk laughlng upon his pi1low, and breathod no mare.\nAubrey relired lo rest, but did riot sleep; the many circumstancos attendirig his acquaint-\nance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he romembered his oath a cald shivering caine over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter tho hovel in which he had left the corp\u017fe, when cl robber met him, and informed him that it was no langer there, having beeri conveyed by himself and comradcs, upon his retiring, to the pinnaole os a nelghbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the sirst cold ray of thc moon that rose afler his dcath. Aubrey astonished, and taking soveral of the men, determined ta go and bury it upori the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the suinmit he fouridno trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the rob6ers swore they poirited out the identical rock on which lbey had laid the body. For o tlme his mind was 6ewildered in conjecturos, butbe at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all apparently conspirod to heighten that superstitious melancholy tbal had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and foon arrived at Smyrncl. While wailing for a vessel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging tho\u017fe effects he had with him belonging lo Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing sevoral weapons of offence, more or less adaptod to ensure the death of the viclim. T here were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at findirig a sheath appclrently ornamented in the fame style a\u017f the dclgger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014haslening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, arid bis horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fittcd, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eycs seemed to need no further certainty\u2014thcy seeined gazing to be bovnd to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the samo varyirig tints upon tho haft and sheath were alike in sp lendour on both, and lofl no room f0r doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe lest Smyrna, and on bis way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady hc had ottempted lo snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not becn heard of since the doparture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken undcr so mariy repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urgirig the speed os thc postilions, as if he were going to sove thc life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a hreezc, which seemed obedient to his wi1l, foon wafted bim to the English shores; ond he hastened to the monsion of his fathers, and there,for a momcnt, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and care\u017fses of his sister, all memory of the past. If sho bef0re, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now thal the woman began t0appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey hod not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was nonc of that light 6rilliancy whi ch only exists in the beated atmasphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mlnd beneath. There was a melclncholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvt from some feeling within, that appearedto indicate a soul conscious os a brighterrealin. Her step was riot that light footing, wbich \u017flrays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightcried by the smile of joy; but when herbrother breathed to her his affection, and would in her pre\u017fence sorget those griefs she knew destroycd his rost, who would have exchanged her smjle for that of the voluptuary? It seemcd as if those eyes,\u2014thclt face were then pIaying in the llght of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and bad not boen presented to the world, it having been thougbt by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when hc might bo her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch 0f her on try into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the rnansi0n of his fathers, and fed upon lhe me1anchaly which overpowered him. He could not feel jnterest about the frivolities of fashionoble strarigers, when hi\u017f mind had been so torn by the evontshe had wilnesfed; but ho determined to sacriflce his own c0mfort to the proteclion of hi\u017f sister. They soon arrived in towri, and prepared for the next doy, which had hecn announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowdwas excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened tbitber. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilc he was standing in a corner by himfels, heedless of all ar0und him, erigclged in the reinembrance that the first time be had seen Lord Ruthuen was in thclt very place\u2014he felt hlmself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voiee he recognized toa well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He hod hardly courage to turn, fearful of seejng a spectre that would hlast him, when he perceived,at a litt1e distancc, the same figure which had attractedhis notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his llmbs a1most refusing to bear thoir weight, be was obliged lo take the arm 0f a frlend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, clnd was driven home. Ho pacod the rooin with hvrriod steps, and fixed his hands upon his heod, as if he were afraid his thoughts were 6ursting from his brain. Lord Rvthveri again before him\u2014circumstarices sta-\nrtcd up in dreadful array\u2014the dogger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, ho could not bclieve it possible\u2014the dead riso again!\u2014He thought his imagjnation had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible lhat it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he atteinpted to ask concerning Lord Ruthuen, the name hung upon his lips, and he could nat succeed in gaining jnformation. He went afew nights after with his sister to the assemhly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired jnto a recess, and t here gave himself up to his own devouring lhoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he r0used himself, clrid entering another room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him lhose features be most abhorred. He sprong forward,seized his sister's arm, and, with hurricd step, forced her towords the slreet: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lord\u017f; and while he was erigaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did riot dare to turn, but, hurrying hls sister, s0on reached home.\nAubrey becaine almost dlstractod. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much m0re completely was it engrossed, now that lhe certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon hi\u017f thovghts. His sisler's attentians were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to cxplain to her what had oaused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more be tbought, the more he wasbewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this mon ster toroarn, bearing ruin upon his breath, amid\u017ft all he held dear, andnot avert its progress? His very sifter might have been touched by him. But even if he were lo break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who wovld believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such o wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. F0r days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes strcoming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nalure. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solilude, hc left his house, roamcd froin street to street, anxious t0 fly that image whi ch haunted him. Hjs dress became neglected, arid be wandered, os often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer t0 be recognized; at first he retumed wilh lhe evening to tbe house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue 0vertook him. His sister, anxious for his sclfety, employed people to folIow him; but they were soon distanced by him wbo fled from a pvrsuer swifter than any\u2014srom thaught. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idca that he lest by his obsence the whole of hif friends, with a fiend am0ngst them, of wboseprosence they were unconscious, he determined to entcr again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his o ath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard arid suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that hjs sister was at last obliged to beg of hlm to abstain from seeking, for her sake, cl society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavcliling, the gvardians th ougbt pro per t0 interpose, and, fearing lhat his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been besore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDe\u017firous os saving him from the lnjuries and \u017fuffering\u017f he had daily encovntered in his wanderin gs, and of prevonting him from exposing to the genercll eye lhose marks of what they considored folly, they engaged a physician to refide in the house, and toke cori\u017ftant eare of him. He hardly appcared to notice il, fo comp1etely was hif mind a6sorbed hy one lerrible subjcct. His incoherence becamo ot last so great, that he was confiried to his cham6er. Thero he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes hod atlairied clglassy lustre;\u2014tbe only signof affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would fometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with lo0ks that sevorely aff1jcted hor, he would desire hor nat to louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your lovefor me js aught, do not go near him!\" When, bowever, sbe inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! trve!\" and again he sank inta a state, wbence not even sbe could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passlng, his incoherences became loss frequent, and his mind threw osf a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite riumber, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of tbe year, one of his guardians entering hi\u017f room, 6egan to converse with his physician upon the melanchoIy circum\u017ftance of Avhrey's being in \u017fo awful a situation, when hif sister was going next day to be marrled. Instantly Aubrey's attentionwas attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelIect, af whjch they feared he had been depriued, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in soolety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonlshed them still more by hif expressing his intentian lo be present ot the nuptials, and desiririg to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutcs his fister was wjth him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her louely smile; for he pressed her to his 6reast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more a1ive to the feclings of affeetion. He began to speak with all bis wonted warmth, and to congralulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upori her breast; 0pening it, wbat was his surprise at beholding tbe features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxy\u017fm of rage, and trampled it vnder foot. Upon her asking him why he lhus destroyed the resemblarice of hcr futurehvsband, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantjc expre\u017fsion of countenance, he bade her swear that \u017fhe would never wed this rnonster, for he\u2014 But he could n0t advance\u2014it seomed as if that vojce again bade him remeinber his oath\u2014he turried suddenly raun d, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him bvt saw no one. In the meantime thc guardians and physiciari, who hadheard the wholc, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing bim from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave hiin. He fell upon his knces to them, he implored, he begged of them to deloy but for onc day. They, attrihuting this to the insanity they imagined had taken passe\u017fsion of his mind, endeavoured to pacjfy him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had colled the morning after the drclwing-room, and had 6een refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily uriderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concoaIed from those among whoin he had galnod this inforination. He hclsteried to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interestin his sate, he gradually won tbe ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dclngers and toi1s to recount\u2014could fpeak af himself as of an indiuidua1 having rio sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her lo wh0m he addressed hiinself;\u2014could lell how, sjnce he knew her, his existericc, had begun to feem warthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her sootbing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's art, or such was the wi1l of fate,that ho gained her affections. The title of the e1der branch fcllling at length lo him, he obtained an important cmbassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marriage, (in \u017fpite of hcr brother's deranged stote,) which was to take pl ace the very day before hi\u017f departure for thecontinent.\nAubrey, when he waf left by the physician arid his guardians, attompted to bribe the servants, hut in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his sjsler, conjuring her, as she ualved her own happincss, her own honour, and the honour of tbose now in the grave, who once held her in tbeir arm\u017f as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which hedenounced the most heavy curses. The servant\u017f promised they would deliver it; bulgiving it lo the physjcian, he thought it bettcr not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nigbt passed on without rest tothe busy inmates of thc houfe; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more eclsi1y bc conceived than desorjbed, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew alrnost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last over came their vjgilance, they gradvally stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He scized the opportunily, with orie bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly assem6led. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurriedhim from tbe room, spe-\nechlesf with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ea r\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushedhim towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woma n, had come in search of hjm. Aubrey oould no longcr support himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. Thlf was not inentioned to his si ster, who was not pre\u017fent whcn he ontered, as tho physician was afraid of agilating ber. Tbe marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom Ieft London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisler's guardjans mightbe ca1led, and when the midnight hour had ftruck, he re1ated composodly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when lhey arrjved, it was toa late. Lord Ruthven had dlsappoared, and Aubrey's sisler had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER,CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was clll before him, wbere to choofehjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board ono of his Majesty'f vessels, in the year 1812, we put inlo the barbour of Mitylene, in the i\u017fland of that naine. The beauty of this placo, and the certairi supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels tovisit it\u2014both men of war and merchonlmcn; and th0ugb it lies rather out of the lrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounlies amply repay sor the deviation of a v0yage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the pvrser bargaining for cattle with the natiues, lhe clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Sch0ol, and other pIacef, where we had been before. On lhe brow of Mount Ida (a smalI monticule so named) we met wjth and engaged a young Greek as our guide, wh0 told us be had come from Scia with an English lord, who left the jsland four dclys preuious to our arrival iri hls se1-\nueccl. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would bave taken me with him; but I did not ehoose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to got married. He wcls an odd, but a very good mon. The cottage over the hill, facing the riuer, belongs to him, and he has left ari old man in chorge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (obo ut L250 English currency,) and has rcsided there aboul fourteen months, though not conftantIy; for he sails in his felucca very often to lhe different islands.\"\nThis account oxcited our curiosity uery much, ond we lost no time in hostenirig to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old rnan, who conducted us ouer the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an enlrance hall, a drowing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet anriexed. They were clll simpIy decorated: ploin green-stained waI1s, marbIe tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play throvgh the bronebes by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small br0nze Venv\u017f in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnitvro. In the ball stood half a dozen English cane chairs,and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had rnerely a large mattress spread on lbe floor, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the cornmon bed throughout Greece.In the sitting-room we observed cl marble rccess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in cl large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not lhink oursolves justlfled in oxamining lhe contents. On tbe tablet os the recess lay Voltajre's, Shokspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's workf complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schillor's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Canstantinople, rnuch torn, but no English book 0f any description. Most of these books were filled with margirial notes, written with a pencil, in Italian clnd Latin. The Messiah was literaIly scribbled all over, and marked with sllps af paper, on wbich also were remarks.\nThe old mcln said: \"The lord had been reading these books the everiing befare he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" \u017faid he, \"there they must lle until his returri; sor he is sa parliculclr, that were I to move ane thing withoutordors, he would frownvpon me for a week t0gether; he is othorways very good. I once djd him a fervice; and I haue the praduce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resldes in a sinall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianop1e; I don'l know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance af tho house external1y was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paces lang and fourteeri brocld, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corniccs, (as jt is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were corisiderably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey carpet, beneath an awnlng of st rong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus fvrnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying tho cvenirig breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusteririg together on itf borders, and under lhe shadc of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with on ornamental w ooden back was placed, on which we werc told, the lord passed many of his cvenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and tcllking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view froin lhis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye vlew.\" A line of rich vineyardsled lhe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oljve and myrtle trees iri b1oom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decay. A smclll ftream issuirig from the ruins descended in braken cascades, until it waslost in the woodf near the mountain's base. Tbe sea smootb as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in front; arid a little on the left, througha vista of lofty chosnut and palrn-trees, several sinall islands were distinctly ob\u017ferved, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I se1dorn enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name oftbe person who had resided in this romontic solilude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gonc to Candia. \"Tbe Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cou1dtell, but I am sure he willnot,\"\u2014\"And cannol you tell, old friend?\" \u017faid I\u2014\"If I can,\" \u017faid he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on ovr return to the town we lcarnt soveral particulars os the isolated l ord. He had portioned e ight young girls when he was last upon the is1and, and even danced with them at lhe nuptial feast. He gave a oow to 0ne man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who liue by weauing these articIes. He also boughl a new boat for a fisherman wha had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor childron. In short, be appeared to us, from a1l we collected, to have been a very eccentric and bonevolent character. Orie circurnftance we learnt,which our old friend at the cottage thought proper nol to disclose. He had a most beautiful davghter, with whom theIord was often seen walking ori the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the vse os it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peaceful isIe of Mitylene; our imogin-\nations all on the rack, guessjngwho lhis rambler in Greecc could be. Ho had money it was euldent:he had philanthropy of dispofition, and all tho\u017fe eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FDSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels an thc islond of Tenedos, and I also vi\u017fited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years sram home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recogni2ed the recluse of Calcla in every poge. Deeply did we regret not having been more curiovs in our researche\u017f at tbo cattage, bvt we consoled ourselves witb the idea os returning to Mitylene on \u017fome future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not qvile uriinteresting, and in justice t0 his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling djsposition, averso to associating withburnan nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direclly the reverse, as may be plainly gathcred from these Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elcgantly depicted in his lordship'\u017f poems, seem to have tbeir seat in his hosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his eourting the repose of solitude is cln additional reason sor mark ing him as cl being on whose heart Religion hath set her sea1, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man oan read the precedirig pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a covntryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assumc a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with eaution, particvlarly wheri directed against mcln's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do goodin secret, arid shun tbc world's applause, is the surest testimany os a virtvous heart arid self-approving coriscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown-oourt, Fleet-street.","14":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon whlch this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appcars to be common: it did not, however, extend itself ta the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timo, the idea becoming prevalent, tbat a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradua1ly increased, and formed the subjecl of many wanderful stories, stjll extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon thc blood of the yourig and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variatjori, al1 over Hvngary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedjly diod of consumptions; whilst tbese human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and thoir veins bccame distended lo such a state of repletion, as ta cause tbe bIood to flow from all the passages af their bodies, and even froin the very pores of thejr skins.\nIn the London Joumal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accovnt ofa particular ca\u017fe of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, thatupon an examinatjon of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arno ld Paul, had been heard to say, that, cll Cassovicl, on the frontjers of the Turkish Servia, be had been tormentcd by a vampyre, but had found a woy to rid himself of the euil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyr-\ne's grave, and rubbing bimself with his blood. Thi\u017f precaution, however, did nol prevent him from becomlng a vampyrc him\u017felf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons coinplained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was mclde, that four porsoris hcld been deprivcd 0f life by his attacks. To prevent fvrther mi\u017fchief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagnj, took up the bady, and found it (as is supposed lo be usual jn cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirelyfree fr0m corruption, and emlttlng at the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and floridbload. Proaf having been thus obtairiod, they rosorted to tho accuslomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burnedhis body, and threw the ashes int0 his grave. The same measures wcre adopted wlthlbe c0rses of thoso persons who hod previously died from vompyrisin, lest they should, iri their turri, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal beljef is, that a porson sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrovs rodomontade is here related, bccause it seems better adapted to illvstrate the subject of the prescnt observations than any other lnstarice whjch could be adduced. In mclny partsof Greece it is oonsidered as a sort of punishment after dcath, for somo heinous crimc committed whilst in oxistence, thot tbe deceased is not only doorned to vampyrise, but eompelled to confine his infernal vifitations solely to those beings he loved most whiIe up0n earth\u2014those t0 whom he was bound by tics of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,Thy corfe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood ofall thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wjfe, Atmidnight drain lhe stream of life; Yet loatbe the banqvet whioh perforce Mvst feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere tbey yel expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy slowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must foll, The youn gest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee witb a father 's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy hearl in flame! Yet thou mvst ond tby task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And tbe last glassy glance must view Whicb freezcs o'er its lifcless blue; Then with unhal1owed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wben shorn Asfection's fo ndest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thce Memorial of thineagony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashirig tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014arid witb GouIs and Afrits rave, Till theso in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey bas olso introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" thc vampyre c0rseof the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved wbilst in exislence. But this cannot be supposed to bave resulled fr0m the sinfulness of her life, sbe bei ng pourtrclyed throughout tho whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his lravels of several ast0nishing cases of vampyrism, to which he preterids to bave been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this fubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionary narrcltives illustrative os its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious andinteresting notiees on this sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limils of a note, necesfarily devoted to explclnation, and wbich rnoy riow bc conclvded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in rnosl general acceptation, there are severalothers synoriymous with it, madc use of in various partf of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happenod that in the mjdsl of the dissipatians attendant upon a London wiriter, there appeared al the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for hjs singularities, than bis rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he cou1d not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughler of the fair only attracted his attenlion, tbat he might by a laak qvell it, and tbrow fear into those breosts whero thoughtlcssness reigned. Those wh0 felt this sensation of owe, could not explain whence itarose: sorne attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's facc, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce thr-\nough to the inward workings ofthe heart; but fell upon the cheek wlth a lcaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities cau\u017fed him to be invitod to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had heen accuslomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasod at having something in their prefenceeapable os engaging tbejr attention. In fpite of the deadly bue of his faeo, wbich nevcr gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion os possjon, th0ugh its form and out1ine were beaulisv1, many of the female hunters after notoriety altempted ta win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe moc kery af every m0nsler shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when sho slood before him, though his eyes were apparently flxod upon her's, slil1 it seemed as if they wero unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled,and she left the fjeId. Bvt though the comrnon adultress oould not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparentcaution with which he spoke to the vlrtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed h imsels to semales. He had, however, the reputatiori af a winni ng torigue; and whether it was that it even overcarne the dread af hls singvlar character, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among thoso semales who form the boast of their sex frorn thejrdomestic virtues, as ainong those who sully it by their vices.\nA bout the same tirne, there came to London a young gentlemcln of the name of Aub rey: he was an orphan left with cln only sisler iri the possession of great wealth, by parents who diod while he was yet in childhood. Lest also ta himself by guardiclns, who thought it their dvty merely to take careof his fortune, whjle they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgmerit. He had, hence, that high romantic feellng of honour arid candour, whicb daily ruins so many miIljners' apprentioes. He be1ieved all to sympathise witb virtue, and thought thal uice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque efsect of the scerie, as we see in romarices: he thought thal the misery of a cottage morely consisted jri the vesting of clothos, which were af warm, but which were better adapted lo the painter's eyc by their irregulor folds and various coloured patches. He thovghl, in fine, thal the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was haridsome, frank, and rich: for tbese reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, striuing which should describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at tho same time, by their brightening countenanccs when he approached, and hy thelr sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notionsof his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance os hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the taIlaw and waxcandles lhat flickered, not from the preseneo of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of ploasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensationin bis gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above descri6od, crossed him in his career.\nHc walched him; and the very impossibility of formingan idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in bimsclf, who gave few other signs of his abservation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance os their contact: allowing bis jmagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensily to extravagant ideas, he s0on formed this object lnto the hero of a romance, clnd determiried to observe the off\u017fpring of his fancy, rather tbari the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was alwclys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation iri \u2014 Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiofity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for hjrn to perform the tour, which for many generations hos been thought necessary to onable the young lo take some rapid steps in the carecr of vice towards putting themselves upon an equcllity with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as is fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous iritrigucs are mentioried as the subject\u017f of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree os skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediotely mentioning his intenlions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from bim, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly ao cepted it, and in a few days they had passed tbe oircling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's charactor, and now be fovnd, that, though many more of his aclions were exposed lo his view, the results osfered diffcrent eonclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from bis hand more than cn0ugh to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey covId nat avoid remarking, that it wos not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by lhe misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed snee rs; bul wheri the profligatecame to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wclllow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniqvity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed hy him to the greater importunity af the vicious, which generally prevails over the reliring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance obout lhe charity of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was be\u017ftowed, inevitably found that there was acurse upon it, for they were all eithcr led t0 the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and tbe most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns tbrough which tbey pafscd, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparerit eagerness with which his campanion sought for the centres of all fasbioriable vice; there he entered into oll the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the knownsharper was bis clntclgonist, clnd then he lost even more thclri he gained; but it was alwclys with the fame unchanging fac e, with which he gerierally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered thc rash youthful novlce, or the luckloss father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed forturie's low\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid a\u017fide, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than lhat of the cat whil\u017ft dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left tho formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle be adorried, curfing, in the soli tude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn bim wilhiri the reacbof this fiend; whilst mony a fatber sat frantic, amjdft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealtb, wherewith to buy even sufficiont to satisfy their pre\u017fent craving. Yet he to0k no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, lhe last gildor he had iust snatcbed from the corivulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but bc the result of a certajn degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of combating tho ounning of tho more experienced. Aubrey ost en wished to repre\u017fent this to his friend, and beg him to resign thclt charity and pleasuro which proved the ruin 0f all, and did not tend t0 his own profit;\u2014bvt he dclayed it\u2014for each day he bopod his friend would givo him some opportunity of spcaking frankly and openly to hiin; howevcr, lhis never occurred. Lord Ruthven iri his carriage, and amjdst thc uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and lhough Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no groater gratification from lt than the conftant oxcitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaltedimagination began to assumcthe appearclnce of samething supernatural.\nThey soon arrived cll Rome, and Aubrey fora time 1ost sight of his oompanion; he left him in daily clttendance uponthc morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of anothor almost desorted cjty. Whilst be was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatienoe; the first was from his sister, breathjng nothing but affectjon; the others were from hi\u017f guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had besore entered into his irnaginatjon that lhere wcls an evil pawer resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufsjcient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his imrnodiately leaving his friend, clrid vrged, that bis character was dreadfully uici0us, for that the possession of irresistjble powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to soeiety. It had been discovcred, that his contcmpt for the odultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, tbe partner of his guilt, sbould be hurled from the pinnclcle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abys\u017f of infamy and degradation: in sine, that all those fernales whom ho had sought, apparently on account of their uirtue, hod, sirice his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not sorupled to expose the whole deformlty of their vices to the publie gaze.\nAubrey deterrnined up0n 1eaving orie, whose oharacter had not yet shown o single brigbt point on wbich to rest the eye. He resolvcd to invent some plau\u017fible pretext for abandoriing hjm altogcther, purposing, in the mean whjle, to watch him more closely, and to let rio slight circumstances poss by urinoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshjp was endeauouring to work upon the iriexperience of thedaughler 0f the lcldy whose house ho chie-\nfly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female if met with in society; he wcls tberefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignationhad been appoirited, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, lhough thought1ess girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of L0rd Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him al thc fame time thclt be was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentians were such as he supposed all would have upon svch an occasion; and upon being pre\u017fsed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immedialely writing a note, t0 say, that frorn that moment be must declino accornpanying his Lordship in thc remoinder of their proposed tour, he ordered his fervant to seek other apartments, and oalling upon the rnother af the lady, informcd her of all he knew, n0t only with r egard to hor daughter, but cllso concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his eomplete assent to a separatj0n; but did not hintany svspician of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interpasition.\nHaving 1eft Rome, Aubrey dirocted his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himsels at Athe ns. He then fixed his residence in the bouse of a Groek; and soon occupied hiinself in tracing the faded records of aricient glory upon monuments lhclt clpporently, afhamed of ohronic1ing the deods of freemen onIy beforo slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under thc fame roof as himse1f, existed a bein g, so beautiful and delicate, that she might havc formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithfvl in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke t0o muchmind for any one to thirik she could belong to those who had no souls. As she donced upon the plain, or tripped along thc mountain's side, one would have thought the gazolle a poor type of her beauties; for who wauld have exchanged her oye, opparently the eyc of animated naturc, for that sleepy luxurious look ofthe onimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe often accompanied Auhrey in hi\u017f seareh after antjquities, and often would the uncanscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her forrn, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almo\u017ft effaced tablet, in the oontemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofton would her tresses fcllling, as she flitted around,exhl6it in the sun's ray such do1icalely brilliant and fwlftly fading hues, it mighl well excuse the forgetfulne\u017fs of the antiquary, who let escape frorn his mind the very object he had before thought os vital importance to the proper interpretation of cl passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to descri be charms whioh all feel, but rione can appreciate?\u2014It was innocencc, youth, and beavty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst ho drew those remains os which hc wi\u017fhed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she wovld stand by, and watch the magic esfects os his pencll,in tracing the scenes os her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would pairit, to him in aIl the glowing oolours of youthful memory, the rnarriago p0mp she remembered viewing ln her infancy; and then, turning to suhjects that had evidently made a greclter impressiori upon her mind, would tell him all lhe supernatural lales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent helief of what she narrated, excited the interest cven of Aubrey; and often as she lold him lhc ta1e of the living vompyre, wbo had passed years clmidst bjs friends, and dearest tie\u017f, forced every year, by fcedingupon the life of a l0vely fomole ta prolong hif existence for the ens uing months, his blood would ruri oold, whilst he clttempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fontasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among tbemselvos, af ter several of their near relatives and children had bcen found marked wlth the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wben she f0und him so incredulous, shc begged 0f hiin to believe her, for it had beeri, remarked, that those wha had dared to questlon their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detajled to him the traditional appcclrance of these monsters, and hls horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthucn; he, howcver, still pcrsisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wanderedat the many cojncidences which had all tended to excite a belief jn tho supernatvral power of Lord Rulhveri.\nAubrey began to attach himself more andmore t0 Ianlhe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affeeted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for hls vision of romonce, won his heart; and wbile he ridiculed the idca of a young man af English hahits, morrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself m0re and more attclched to the almost fairy form before hlm. He would tear himsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for \u017fome antiquarian research, he wo uld depart, determiried not to return until his object wos attained; but he alway\u017f found itlmpossible to six his atlention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianlhe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; bul it was because she had no loriger any one wilh wham she could visit her favourile haunts, whjlst her guardian wa\u017f0ccvpied in sketching or uncovcringsame fragment which had yel escaped the destructive hclnd of tjme. She had appealed t0 her parents ori the subject of Vampyres, and they botb, with several pre\u017fent, affirmed their existence, pale wjth horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proeeed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heord lhe name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass lbrough a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the re\u017fort of the uampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most boavy evils as imponding upon him who dared t0 cro\u017fs thoir path. Aubrey made light of lhejr representatlon\u017f, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thu\u017f to mock a superjor, infornal power, the very name of which apparently made thoir blood frcez e, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set aff upon his excurfion unatterided; he was surprised to observe the molclncholy face of his host, and wa\u017f coneerned to find that hjs words, mockjng the belief of those horrible fiends,bad jn\u017fpired tbem with such terror. When he was about lo depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of hlm to rcturn, ere night allowod the power of these beings ta be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occvpied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-ligbt would saori end, arid that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, \u017fo rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, howover, mounted bis borse, determined to moke up by speed for hjs delay: but ll was loo 1ate. Twilight, ln these southern climates, ls almosl unknawn; immodiately lhe sun \u017fets, nighl begins: arid ere he had aduanced far, the power of the storm was clbove\u2014its eohoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavyrain forced its way tbrough tho cariopying faliage, whilst the blue forked ligbtning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the eritangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he f0und, by the glare of lightning, that he was iri tbe neighbourhood af a havel that hard1y lifled itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brusbwood whicb surrounded it. Dismounting, he appr0ached, hoping to find some one to guide him to tbe town, or at Ieast trustirig to obtain shelter from the pelting os the st0rm. As he approaebed, the tbunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling wilh the stisled, exullant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startIed: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a svdden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkriess: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continucd, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contaetwith some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succecded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whose strength seemed superhuman: dctcrmined to sell his Iife as dearly as he could, he strv ggled; bul lt was in vain: he was lifted from his seet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upori his breclsl, had placedhis harids vpon his throat\u2014whcn the glare of many torches penetrating through tbe hole thal gave 1ight in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he inslantly rose, and, leclving bis prey, rushed thr ough the door, and in a moment the crashjng of the branches, as hc broke through the wood, was no longer beard. The st0rm was now sti1l; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was saon heard by those witbout. They entered; the light of their torch es fell upon the mud walls,and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of s0ot. At the desire of Aubrey tbey searched for her who had attracted him by her eries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but whot was his harror, when the light of thetorches once more burst upon him, to perceive lhe airy form of his fair coriductress brought in a lifelcss corse. He shut his eyes, bopjng thal it was bvt cl vislon arising from his disturbed imaginatian; 6ut he ogain saw the same forrn, when he unelosed them, stretched byhis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, n0t even upon her lip; yct there was a stillnesf about her sace that seemed almost as attoching as tbe life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her rieckarid br east was blood, and upon her throal were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the meri pointed, crying, simultaneausly struck witb horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by tbe side of her who had lately heen to hirn the 0bjecl of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the fIower of life that had died within her. He knew not what bis thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflectlon, clnd take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particvlar construction, which had boon found iri the hut. They were soon met by differerit parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a inother had inissed. Their lamenta61e cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some drcadsul catastrophe. \u2014To de scrjbe their grief would be jmpossible; bul when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was soized with a most vlolent feucr, and was often delirious; in these intervals he wouId call up0n L0rd Ruthven clnd upon Ianthe\u2014by somc unaccountable cornbination he seemed to heg of his former companion to spare tbe being he loved. At othor times he would jmprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse hjm as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chancedat this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon heclring af the stateof Au6rey, immediately placed himsels in the same house, and became his constant attendanl. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he wcls horrified and startled at the sjght of him whose image be had now combined with tbat of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their soparation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care wbich he showed, soon reconcilod him to his pre\u017fence. His lordship seemed quite ohanged; he no longer appeared that apalhetic beirig who had so astonished Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence bogon to be ra pid, ho again gradually retired into the sclme slclte of mind, and Aubroy perceived no differenee frorn tbe former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intenlly upon bim, with a smile of malicious exvltation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, bvt thjs smile haunled him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watchjrig the tideless waves raised by tbe coaling breeze, or in marking the progress os those orbs, circling, like our world, the move1ess sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish t0 avoid lhe eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mvch weakened, and thal elasticity of fpirit wbioh had once fo distinguished hirn now seemedto have slod for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but inuch as he wished for salitvde, his mirid cauld not find it ln the neighbovrhood of Atbens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he hod formerly frequented, Iarithc's form stood by hls side\u2014if he sought it in the wo0ds, her light step would appe ar wondering amidst tbe underwo0d, in quest of the mode\u017ft violet; then suddcn1y turning round, would show, to his wild imagincltion, her paIe foce clnd wounded throat, with a meek \u017fmile upon her 1lps. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of whlch created sucb bitter associations in his mind. He proposed toLord Ruthucri, to wh0m he he1d himself bound by tbe tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that tbey should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet secn. They travclled in every direction, and sought euery spot to which a recollection could be attached:but though they thus haslencd from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed wbat they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, bul they gradually began to slight these reports, which they lmagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom lhey defended fr0m pretended dangcrs. In consequence of thu\u017f neglecting tbe advice of the inhabitants, on orie occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enter-\ning, however, a narrow def-\nile, at the botlom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock 6roughl down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startlcd by the whlstling of bullets clofe to their hoads, and by the echoed report of sevoral gvns. In an instant thejr guardf had left lhem, and, placing themselvef bebind rocks, had begun to fire iri lbe direction wherice the report oame. Lord Ruthven clnd Aubrey, lmitating thelr example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed af boing thus detained by a foe, who wilh lnsulting shouts bade them oduance, and being exposed lo unreslsting slaughter, is ariy of the robbcrs shovld climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost tbe shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hclstened to his assistance; and, no longor hceding the contest or bls own peril, was soon surprised by sceing the rabbers' faces around him\u2014his guards hauing, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, irnmediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to eonvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, hc was n0 more dislurbed by their presenee\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrance till tbeir comrade should return wilh the pramised sum, for whicb he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortlficatlon ensued, and death feemed advancing with hasty stcps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; be seemed as unconsciou\u017f os pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the lasl ov ening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assjst me! you may save me\u2014you rnay do more than that\u2014I mean not my Iife, I heed the deoth of my existence as llttle as that of the passing day; but you may savc my honaur, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs opace\u2014I cannot expIajri the whole\u20146ut if you wouldconceal all you know ofme, my horiour were free from stain in lhe wor1d's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall nat be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising hjmself with exultant violence, \"Swear by aIl your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, sor a year and a day you will not import your kn0wledge of my crimes ar death to any Iiving being in any way, whatever may happen, or whateuer you may see. \"\u2014His eyes \u017feerncd bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing uponhls pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey retired to re\u017fl, but did not sl eep; the many circumstances attending his acquairitance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering carne over him, as jf from the presentiment of something horribIe awaitinghim. Rising early in the morning, he was ab out to entor the hovel in which ho had left the corpse, when a ro6ber met him, clnd inforrned him thclt it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himsclf and comrades, upon hif retiring, to tbe pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, aeoording to a promisc they had giuen his lordship, that it should 6e exposed to the first eold ray of the moon lhat rose after his death. Auhrey aftonished, and taking several of the men, determined togo and bury it upon the spot whcrc it lay. But, when hc had moun ted to the summit he found no troce 0f either the corpse or thc clathes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the jdentical rock ori which they had laid the body. For a time bis mind was bewjldered in conjeclures, bul he at last returned, convinced thclt they had huried thecorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a counlry in which he had met with such terrjble misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to hejghten that superslitious melancboly that had seized upon his mind, be res0lved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel lo oonvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to LordRuthven. Among\u017ft 0ther thirigs there was a case eontaining several weapons af affencc, mare or less odapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at sinding a shcoth apparently ornamented in the \u017famestyle as lhe dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the wcapon, ond his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the fheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to need no fvrlher certclinty\u2014they \u017fecmed gazirig to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbeljeve; but the particular form, the same varying tints vpon the haft and sheath were alike in splend0ur on b0th, and left n0 room for doubt; there were alsa drops of blood on eclch.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hi\u017f way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted ta snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she hod not been heard of since lhe departure of his lordsbip. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under fo mariy repeated horrors; he was afrajd that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He became mo rose and silent; and his only 0ccupatiori cansisted in urging the spoed os the poftilions, as if he were going ta save the lise of some ane he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, wbich seomed obcdient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastoned to the mansion of his fathers, and therc, for a momerit, appearod tolose, in the einbraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she besore, by her infantine caresses, had gained his asfectlon, now thclt the womari began lo appear, she was ftill inore attachingcls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thal winning grace whieh gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-r0om assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exifts in the heoted atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye wcls never lit up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was o melaricholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortvne, but from fome feeling within, that appeclred to indlcate a s0ul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not lhat light f0oting, which strays where'er a butterf1y or a coIour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her fclce was nevcr brighteried by the smile of joy; but when her brother breothed to her hls affeeti0n, and would jn her presence forgct those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchonged her smile for that os lhe volupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet orily eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it hauing been thougbt by her guardians more fit that her presontation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, shou1d be the opoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the melancholy which ovorpowered him. He could not feel interest about the friuolities os fashjoriable strangers, when his mind had been \u017fo torri by the eucnts he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protectiori of his sister. Thoy soan arrived in town, and prepared for lhe next day, which bad been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room bad not boen held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bosk in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Wbile ho wcls standing in a corner by himself,heedless of all around him, engaged iri thc remembrance that the firsl time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he fe1t himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he reeognized too well, sourided in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hard1y caurage to turn, fearfu1 of seeing a spectre that would blasthim, when he perceiued, at a little di\u017ftance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into sooiety. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear lheir weight, hc was obliged to take the clrm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was drlven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from bis brain. Lord Ruthven agairi bofore him\u2014ciroumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused hlmse1f, he could not beljeve il possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thovght his imagination had oonjured vp the imagc his mind was rest ing upon. It was impossible that it covld be real\u2014he detormined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to osk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung vpon his lips, and he could not succecd in gaining information. He went cl few nightsafter with his sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her urider the protection of a matron, he retircd into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring lhoughts.Perceiving, al 1ast, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anolher room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in eamest conuersotion; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested ta move, turned round, and revealed to him those fecltures he mo\u017ft abhorred. He sprang f0rward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door hc found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wclitlng for their lords; and while he was engaged jri passing them, he agclin heard that voice whisper close to hirn\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reacbed home.\nAubrey became a1most distracted. If before hjs mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's liulng again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were naw unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her whot had caused his abrupl coriduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewjldered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to aIlow this monster to roam, bearing ruin vpon bis breath, amjdst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touehed by him. But even if he were to break his oath, arid disc1ose bis svspiciorif, who wouldbelieve him? He tbought os employing his own hand to free the world from \u017fuch cl wretch; but death, he rcmembered, had beeri already mocked. For days hc reinained in thjs state; shut up in his room, be saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wha, with eyes streamlng with tears, besought him, for her sake, to \u017fupport nature. At lost, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, helest his house, roamed from street to stre-\net, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress becamc rieglected, and he wandered, as often exposod to the noon-day sun as to the rnidnight damps. He was no l0nger to be recognized; at first he returned with lhe everiing to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overloak bim. His \u017fister, clnxjous for his safety, employed people to follow bim; hut they were soon distanced by bim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014srom thought. Hif conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by hif absence the whole of his friends, wlth a fiend ainongst tbem, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiouf to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approacbed with intimacy. But when he entered inlo o room, his haggard and suspicious Iooks were so strlking, hi\u017f inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at laft obliged to beg of him to abstain froin sceking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrarice p r0ved unavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mjnd was beeoming alienated, lhey thought it high time to resume again that lrust which had been before imposed upon thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the irijurjes and sufferings he had daily encountcred in his wandorings, and of preventing him fromexpofing to the generol eye those marks of what they considered folly, tbey engaged a physician to reside in thehouse, ond take conslarit carc of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, fo completcly wos his mind absorbed by ono terrible suhjeot. His incoherence beeame at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would oflen lie sor days, incapablc of being roused. He had become cmaciated, his eyes had attained o glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and reeollection remairiing displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to t ouch him. \"Oh, do not tovch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do riot go near him!\" Wheri, however, she inquired to wbom be referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" ond again he sonk into a slate, whence not everi shc could rouse him. This Iasted many monthf: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences bocame less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whi lst his guardjans 0bserved, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wheri, upon tbe last day of the year, one of his guardians entering hls room, began lo converse witb his physician upon the melanoholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awfvl a situation, when his fister was going next day to be married. Instontly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to wham. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared hc bad been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom hc had met with in society, Avbrey seemod pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis intention to hc present at the nuptiaIs, and dcsiring lo see his sister. Tbey answered not, but in a few minutes his sistcr was with him. Hc was apparently again capable of beirig affected by the jnfluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet witb tears, slowing at the thought of her brothor's being once morc alivo ta the fcelings of affoction. Hc began to speak wilh all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her vpon ber marriage with a person sa distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon ber breast; opening it, what was his surprise al b eholding the features af the mo nster who had so lorig influenccd hif life. He seized the p0rtrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled il under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblarice of her futvrc husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her bandf, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her swear that she would nevor wed this inonster, for he\u2014 But he could not advarice\u2014it seemed as if lbat voice again bade him remcmber his oath\u2014he turned sudderily round, thinking Lord Ruthuen wcls riear hlm bul saw no one. In thc meantime the guardians and physician, wha had heard tbe whole, and tbought this was but a return of his disorder, cntered, and forcing him from Mifs Au6rey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he irnplored, he begged of tbcm ta delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possessjon of his mind, erideavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had oalled the mornjng after the drclwing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard os Aubrey's ill health, he readily understo0d hlmsels to be the cause of lt; but whon he learned thclt he was deemed insarie, his exultation and pleasure could hardIy be coricealed from those among whom ho had gclined this information. He hostened ta the h0use of his former companion, and, by constanl attendance, and tbe pretence of g reat affection for the br0ther ond interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist hif power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could spoak of himself as of an indiuidual h aving no sympathy with any heing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himscIf;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preseruation, if it were mercly that ho rnight lislen to her soothing occents;\u2014in fine, be knew so well how lo u\u017fethe serpent's art, 0r such was the will of fate, tbat he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length t0 him, he obtained an important embassy, which se rved as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged slate,) which was to toke place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAvbrey, when he wa\u017f left by the physielan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his \u017fister, corijurjng her, as she valued her own happiness, bor own honovr, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in lheir arms as their hope and the hope of their bouse, to delay but for a few hours lbat marriage, on which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought jt bettcr not to harass any more the mind os Miss Aubrey hy, what he oorisi dered, tbe ravings of a manioc. Night passed on wilh0ut rest to the busy inmates of thc house; arid Aubrey heard, with a horror that moy more eosily be eonceived than doscribod, the notes of husy prepclration. Morning came, and tbe sound of carriagef broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cu riosjty of tbe servants clt last overcame thelr vjgjlance, they gradually stole clway, leaving him in the oustody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opp0rtunity, with one bourid was out of the room, and in a inoment found himself in the opartment where clll were nearly a\u017fsembled. Lord Ruthven was the fir\u017ft to perceivo him: he immediately approachcd, ond, taking hif arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven wbispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your 0ath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in searcb of him. Aubrey could no longer \u017fupport himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken a b1ood-vesse1, and ho was conveyed lo bed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the pbyslcian was afraid of agitating her. Tbe marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegrooinleft London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be oalled, arid when the midnight hour had struck, he related cornposedly whclt the roader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened lo protect Miss Aubrey; bulwhen they arrived, it was too lclte. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of aVAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wasal1 before hirn, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing thravgb tho Grecian Archipelago, on boclrd one of his Majcsty's vessels, iri the yearI812, we put into the harbour of Mit-\nylene, in the island of that namo. The beauty of this place, and tbe certain supply of cattle arid vegetables always t0 be had there, induce many British vessels to visit jt\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of thc track for ships bound to Smyrna, lts bountjesamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whiIst the men wore employed in watering, and lhe purser borgclining for cattle wilh tbc ncltives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Scbool, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a sma ll monticule so named) we met with and engagcda young Greek as our gujde, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left tbe island fourdays prevjous t0 our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am Iikely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottageover the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has Ieft an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English eurreney,) and has resided thcre about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very oftcn to the differerit isIands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in hastenjng to the h ouse where our countryman had reslded. We were kindly receivod by an old man, who conduct ed uf over the mansion. It consisted os four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall,a drawing-room, a sittingparlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closct annexed. They were al1 simply d ecorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tabl ef on either side, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a smalI sountain beneath, whieh could be made to p1ay through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize Vonus in a leclriing pofture; a large couch or fofa o0mpleted the furriiture. In thc hall stood half a dozen EngIish cane chairs, and an emply bo0k-case: there were no rnirrors, nor a single painting. Tbe bedchamber had merely a lorge mattres\u017f spread ori the f1oor, with two stvffed cotton quiltf and a pillow\u2014the oommon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, lhe old man told us, filled with books clnd papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest ln the clofet: it was open, but we did not think ourselvef justified in examiriing the contents. On the tablet of the reoess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimrnerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Mes\u017fiah; Kotzebuc's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Ilalian edition, printed at Parma in l810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of lhese books were filIed with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ita1ian and Latln. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man sclid: \"The lord had been reading these boaks tbe evening hefore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" sald he, \"there they must lie until his rctum; for he is so porticular, that were I to move onc thing withoul orders, he would frown upon ine for a week logelber; he isotherways very good. I once did him a service; arid I have the produce of lhis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an oged Armenian who rcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the h ouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paoes long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black pIinths and fre-\nl-work comices, (as it is now customary in Grecjan arohilecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. Tbe roof, surrovnded by a li ght stone balustrode, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops arc thus surnished, as uponthem tbe Greeks pass their evcnings in smoking, drinking 1ight wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, clnd erijoying the evening breeze.\nOn tho left hand as we entercd the house, asmall streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and ljmes were clusterlng together on its borders, and under the shade of lwo large myrtle bushes, a marhle seatwith an ornameritaIwooden back was placed, on which we were told, the 1ord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was uery devout, \"and always altended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a 6ird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyardsled the eye to Mount CaIcla, c0vered witb olive and myrt1e trees in bloom, and on tbe summit of which an ancienl Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins de\u017fcended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshod0wed by a single eloud, terminates the view in front; and a litt1e an tbe left, througb a vista of lofty cbesnul and palm-trees, feveral srnall islands were distinotly observed, studding tho light blue waue with spots of emerald greeri. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitIess as to the name of the pers0n who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who hod gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could te1l, hut I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If Ican,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but 0n our retvrn to the town we learnt severa1 parliculars of the isolated lord. He had porlioned eight young girls when ho was last upon the island, and cven dariced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thogirls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and be often gave Greek Testaments to the poor childreri. In shorl, he appeared to us, from all we co1lected, to have been a very eccentric and benevo1ent character. One oircum\u017ftance we leornt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclase. He had a rnost beautiful daughter, with whoin the lord was often seen walkjng on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her bimself the usc of it.\nSuch wos the information with which we departed from the poaceful ifle of MityIene; our imaginations all on the rclck, guessing who tbis rambler in Greeco could be. He hod money it was euident: be bad philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities wbich inark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our daubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupll 0f WYATT'S, wbo had boen travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the islclnd of Tcnedos, and I also visited him at Mlty1ene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been soine yearsfrom home; but \"Childe Haro1de\" being put jnl0 our hands wo recognized the recluse of C olcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret nothaving been moro curious in our researches at the eoltoge, but we consoled ovrseIves with the idoa of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I rnake this statement, believing it riol qujte uninterefting, and in justice to bis lordship's good nome, whioh hos been grossly slandered. He has been described as of anunfeeling disposition, aver\u017fe to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleosures. The foct is directly lhe reverse, as may be plainly gothered from these ljttle anecdotes. Al1 the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have thelr seat in his b0\u017fom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear lo gvide all his actions: and his oourting the repose of solitude is an additional reasori for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her soal, and ovor whose head Beneuolence hath lhrownher maritle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud os him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or p1easures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral inlegrity; and he who dares justify himfelf befarc that awful tribunal where alI must appear, alone may censure the errors of a sellow-m0rta1. Lord Byron'\u017f character is worthy of bis gcniu\u017f. To do go0d in secrot, and shun the world's applause, is the sure\u017ft testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGjllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","15":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri WilIiam Polidori\nTHE superstition upon wbich this tale is foundod is very gcneral in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until after tbe establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its preserit sorm since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becomjng prevalent, tbat a Latin body could riot corrvpt if 6ur ied in their territory, it gradually increased, and sormed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of tbe dcad rising from thoir graves, and seeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread,with some slight variation, a1l over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whcre the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the b1ood of their victims, wbo became emclciated, lo\u017ft their strength, and spcedily died of consu mptions; whilst these human blood-suekers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to svch a stateof replotion, as to cause the bload to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even frorn the very pores of thoir skiris.\nIn tbe London Joumal, of March, I73z, is a curious, ond, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hung-\nary. It appears, thclt upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of tbe place, they positively arid unanimously affjrmed, that, about five years before, a ccrlain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the srontiers os the Turkisb Servia, be had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way torid himself of theevil, by eating some of the earth out of lhe vompyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prcvent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and bvrial, many persons complained of having been tormonted by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life byhis attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted thelr Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as is suppased to be usual in cases of vampyrlsm) fresh, and entirely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the inouth, riose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driveri entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported ta have cried out as dreadfulIy as if he had been alive. Tbis done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopled with the corses of those personf who bad previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, ln their turn, becomo agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked 6y o vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief hailiff.\nThi\u017f monftrouf rodomonlade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subjectof the pre\u017fent observations than any other instance which could be adduccd. In many parts of Greece jt is considered as a sort of punishmcnt after death, for some heinous crime committed wbilst in exiftence, thal thc deceased is not anly doorned to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visltations solely to those bejngs he loved rnost while up0n earth\u2014those to whom bewas bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition o1luded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firsl on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy corse sball from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, Arid suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathc the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livjd living co rse, Tby victirns, ere they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cvrsing thee, thou eursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But orie that for thy crime mvst fall, The youngest, best 6eloved of al1, Shclll bless thee with a fathor's name\u2014 Thot word shclIl wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last linge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'or its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's foridest pledgowos worn\u2014 But now is bornc away by thee Memoricll of thine agony! Yet with tbine own hest 6laod shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then stalking to tby sullen grave, Go\u2014 and with Govls and Afrits rave, Till lhese in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Tha1aba,\" the vompyre eorse os tbe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence. Bul this cannot be supposed to have refulted from lbe sinsvlness os her life, she bejng pourtrayed lhroughout the whole of the tale as a compIete type of purity ond innocerioe. The veracious Tourriefort gives a l0ng account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vclrnpyrism, to which be pretends lo have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of it\u017f effects, has put forth fome learnod dissertotlons, tending to prove jt to 6e a classical, os well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting noliees on lhis singularly horrible superstition might be added; thavgh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuolcd to explanation, and which may now be concluded hy inerely remarking, that tbough the term Vampyre is theone in most general acceptation, the re are several otbers synonymous wlth it, made use of in uarjovs partsof lbe world: cls Vroucolocha, Vardaulachcl, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London wlnter, there appeared at tbe various partles os the leaders os the ton a nohleman, more remarkable for his singulorities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could nol participate therein. Apparently, the lighl laughter of the foir only attractod his attention, that he might by a look qvell it, arid throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessncfs reigned. Those who felt this fensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixirig upon the object's face, did not seem to pe netrate, and at one glance to pierce through to tbe inward worklngs of the beart; but fell upon tbe oheek wlth a leaden ray that weighed upon lhe skin it could not pass. His peculiarities oau\u017fed him to be invited to every house; alI wished to see hirn, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were ploased at having something in thejr presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue os his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blufb of modesty, or from the strong emotion os passion, lhough its form and ovtline were beaut iful, many of the female hunter\u017f after notoriety attempted to win his attentioris, and gain, at lea\u017ft, some mclrks of what they inight term affection: Lady Mereer, who hod been the rnockery of every monstcr shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herfelf in his way, and did all but pul ori thc dresf of a mountebonk, to attract hls notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood 6eforo him, though his eyes were apparcntly fixed upon ber's, stjll it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left lhe sield. But though the common adultress could not influence even tbe guidance os his eyes, it was not that tho female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caulion witb which be spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, thal fewknew he evcr clddressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputaliori 0f a winning longue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vlce, ho was as ofteri among thofe females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic vjrtues, os among those who su1ly it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name 0f Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an 0nly sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he wa\u017f yet in chiIdhood. Left also tohimself by guardians, who thaught it thcir duty merelyto lake care of his fortune, while they relinquished lhe more important charge of bis mind to the careof mercenary subaltems, hc cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour arid candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed alI to sympathise wilh virtue, and thought that uico was thrown in 6y Providonce merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely corisisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irrcgular folds and various coloured patchef. He thought, in fine, that the dreams af poels were the realities of life. Hc was haridsorne, frank, and ricb: for tbese reos0ns, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth tbeir languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, arid by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, \u017foon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attaobed as he was to the rornance os his solilary hours, be was start1ed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thcltflickered, not frorn the presence of a ghast, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatiori in real life for any of that congeries of pleas-\ning picturesond descriptions contained iri those volumes, from which he had formed hi\u017f study. Fjnding, however, somc compensation in bis gratified uanjty, he was a6out to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above descrlbed, crossed him in his care er.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of f0rmirig an idecl of tbe character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, wbo gavo few other sigris of his observatiori os external objects, than the tacjt assent to their existence, implied by tbe avoidarice of thelr contact: allowing his imogination to pioture every thing thal flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romancc, and determlned to observe the offspririg of bis sancy, rather than the person before him. He becamc acquairited with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He grad ually learnt that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, froin the notes os preporation in \u2014 Street, thal he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this fingulclr cbaracter, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thal it was tiine for him to perform the lour, which for many generat ions has been thought neces\u017fary ta eriable the young to take some rapid steps in the ooreer of vice towards putting lhemselves uponan equality with the aged, arid not alIowing them to appear as if fallen from the skics, whenevor scandalou\u017f intrigues are mentioned as lhe subjects of pleclsantry or of prclise, clccording to the degree of skill shown iri cclrryjng thcm on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning hi\u017f intenlions to Lard Ruthven, was surprised to recelve froin him a proposal to join him. Flattered bysuch a mark of esleem from hlm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with othermen, he gladly accepled it, arid in a fewdays they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had rio opportunity of studyirig Lord Rulhven's charaeter, and now he found, tha t, though many more of his actions were exposed to hls uiew, the results offered different conclu\u017fions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse iri bis liberalily;\u2014the idle, the vagaborid, and the beggar, receiued from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon thevirtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed bis alms;\u2014lhefe were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when lhe profligate carno to ask something, not to relieve his wanls, but to clllow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he waf sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to tho grcater imp0rtunjty of the vicious, whicb generally prevailf aver the retiring hashfulness of the virtuous indigont. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon wh0m it was bestowed, inevilably found thal there was a curse upon it, for they were clll either led to tbe scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and olher towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizod at the apparent eagerness with which hi\u017f companion sought for the centresof all fashioriabIe vice; lhere he entered into allthe spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled wilh success, except where the known \u017fharper was hjs antagonjst, and then he lost cven more tbon he gained; but it was always with the \u017faine unohanging face, with which he generally watched the s0ciety arourid: it was not, however, so when he encounlered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a riumerous family; then his very wi\u017fb seemed fortune's law\u2014this appclrent abstractedness of mind waf laid clside, and his eyes sparkled with morefire than that of the catwhilst dallying with the ha1f-decld mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungean, tbe fate that had drawri him within the reach of thjs fiend; whilst many a father sat frantlc, amidst the speaking loo ks af mute bungry children, witbout a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficlent to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gamhling tablo; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from lheconvulsive grasp of the innocent:thi\u017f might but be the result af a certain degree of knowledge, whicb was not, howevor, capable of combating the cunning of themoro expericnced. Au6rey often wjshed to represent thi\u017f to bis friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasvre which proved lhe ruin of clll, and did not terid to bis own profit;\u2014but he deloyed it\u2014for eacb day be hoped his friend would give him some apportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this riever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sceries os riature, was always the same: his eye spoke lefs than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he ohtained no greator gratificcltion from it than the coristant excitement 0f vainly wishing to break that inystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the clppearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his compariion; he left him in daily atlendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whi1st he wenl in search of the rnemorials of another almo\u017ft deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrivod from England, whioh he operied with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter a\u017ftonished him; if il had before enlered into his imaginotion that there was an ovil power resident in his companion, these \u017feemed to give him sufsicie nt reason for the belief.His guardians insisted upon his lmmediately leaving bis friend, clnd urged, that his character was dreadfully viclaus, for that the pos\u017fession os irresistible powerf of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, thal his contempt for lhc adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that bls victim, the partner of his gvilt, \u017fhouId be hurled from the pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy ond degradati0ri: in flne, lhat all those semalef whom he had \u017fought, apparently on account of tbeir virtuo, hod, since his departure, thrown evcn the mask aside, and had nol scrupled lo exposc the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey detormined upon leavingorie, whofe eharacter had notyet shown a single bright point on which to rest tbe eye. He resolved to invent some plau\u017fible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposlng, in the mecln while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight eircumslances pass by unnoticed. He entered inta the same circle, and soon perceived, that hif Lordship was e ndeavouring to work upon the inexperierice of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldoin that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his pla ns in secret; but Aubroy's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an asslgnation had beeri appointed, which would most likely end in the ruiri of an innocent, thougb thoughtles\u017f gir1. Losing rio time, he entered the apartmenl of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him hjs intentions with respeet to the lady, informing him at the some time that he was aware of his being about to meel her that very night. Lord Ruthven clnswered, thathis inten tioris were such as he suppo\u017fed a1l would have upon such an occasj0n; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, inerely laughed. Aubrey relired; and, immcdiately wrjting a note, to say, that from that moment he mvst decline accompanying his Lordship jn the remclinder of their propofed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and col1ing upon lhe mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard t0 her daughter, but also conceming the character of his Lordship. Tbe assignation was prevcnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servanl to notify bls complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greoce, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon fovnd hlmself at Athens. He theri fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the f aded records of ancient glary upan monuments that apparently, ashamcd of chronicling the deed\u017f of freemen orily besorc slaves, had bidden themselves beneath lhe sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself, existed a being, f0 beautiful and delicate, that sho inigbt have formed the modcl for a painter wishing t0 pourtray ori canvass the promjsed hope of thc fajthful in Mahomel's paradise, save lhat her eyes spoke too much mirid for any one to tbink she could belong to those who bad no fouls. As she dclnced upon the plaln, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who w0uld have exchangcd her eye, apparently tbe eyeof anjmated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suiled but ta the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashrnere butlerfly, \u017fhaw the whole beauty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of hjm, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered upon an almost effaeed tablet, in the oontempIation of her sylph-like figvre. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitled arovnd, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the ontiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had besorc thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe chclrms wbich all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crawded drawing-rooms and stisling 6alls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wi shed to preserve a memorial for his future hour\u017f, she would stand by, and watch the magic effocls of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; sbe would then describe to him the circlirig dance upon tbe open p1ain, w0uld paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful momory, the marriage pomp she reinernbered viewing in her infancy; and tben, turnjng to subj ects that had evidently mclde a greater impression up0n her mind, would tell him all tho supcrnatural tales 0f her riurse. Her earnestness andapparent belief 0f what she narrated, oxcited the iriterest even af Aubrey; and often cls she told bim the tale of the living vampyre, who had pasfed yeor\u017f amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every ycar, by fceding upon the life of a 1ovely fernale to prolong his existence for the ensui ng months, hi\u017f blood would run co1d, whilst he attempted to laugb her out of such idle and horrible fclntasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among thomselves, after several of their near relatives and childron had beon found rnarked with the stamp of the fiend's appetlte; and when she found hirn so incredulovs, she begged of him to believo her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had somo proof givcn, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailcd lo him the traditional clppearance of the\u017fe monslers, and his horrar wa\u017f increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lard Rutbven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that tberecould be no truth in her fears, though at lhe same time he wondered at lhe mariy coinoidence\u017f whjch had all tended to excito a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey b egan to attach himfelf more and more to Iantho; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the women ainong whom he had sought for hif vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idecl of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, stjll ho found himsels more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hirn. He wovld tear hiinself at times from her, and, forming a plan sor some antiquarian refearch, he would depart, determined not lo return untjl his object was attained; but he always fovnd it impassible to fix his attention upon theruins around him, whilst in his mind he retoined an image that seemed alone the righlful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and wcls ever the same frank infantile being he had first knawri. She always seeined ta part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one wlth whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching 0r uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructiue band of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed lheir existcnce, pclle wlth horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed up0n one of his excursions, which was lo detain him for a few hours; wben they heard the name of lhe pl aee, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wo0d, where no Greek wovld ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upan any consideration. They described it as lhe resort of the vompyres in their noctvrnal 0rgies, and denounced the most heavy ovilf as impending upon hlm who dared tooross their palh. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idecl; but when he sclw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infe-\nmal power, the very name of which clpparently mode their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excvrsion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerried to find thal his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fierids, had irispired thom with such terror. When he was clbout to depart, Iarithe came to the side of his horse, and earnestIy hegged of him to relurn, ere night allowed the power of these beings to bc put jn action;\u2014he promised. He was, howe ver, so occupied in his reseorch, thal he did not perceive that day-lighl would soon end, and that inthe horizon there was one of those spocks whieh, iri tho warmer climates, so rapidly gather into o tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon lhe devoted country.\u2014He at 1clst, however, m0urited his horse, determined ta make up by speed for hi\u017f delay: but it was too late. Twiljght, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; irnmediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advancedfar, the power of the storm was abovc\u2014its echoing thu ndors had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014lts thick heavy rain forced its way through the oanopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightriing seeined to fall and rcldiate at his vcry feel. Suddonly his harse took fright, and he was carriod with dreadful rclpidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, throvgh fatlgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of 1ightning, thal he was in the neighbovrhood of a hoveI that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some orie to guide bim to the town, ar at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingIirig with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokeri sound;\u2014he was \u017ftartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, wlth a sudden effort, forced open the door of tho hul. Ho found bimself in utter darknoss: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unper-\nceived; for, lhough he called, sti1l the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He faund himself in contact with some one, whom he immedialely seized; when a voice cried, \"Agclin ba ffled!\" to wh ich a loud laugh succeoded; and he felt himself grappled by0ne whose strenglh seemed superhuman: determlned to sell his ljfe os dearly as he could, he struggIed; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet andhurled with enormous f0rce against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw bimself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, hod p1aced his honds upon his throat\u2014when the glare of mariy torches penelrat ing through the hole that gaue light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leavi ng his prey, rushed through the door, andin a moment the crasbing of the branches, as be broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablc of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torchos fell vpori the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the dosire of Aubrey they fearched for her who had attrclcted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the lighl of the torches once more 6urst upan hiin, to perceive the airy farm af his fair conductress brought ln a lifeless corse. Ho shut his eye\u017f, hoping lhat it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imclginati0n; but he again saw the some form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was nocolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet therc was a stillness about her face that seemed almosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upori herthroat were the marks 0f t eeth havlng opened the uein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneovsly strvck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Varnpyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lifc that hod died within her. He knew nat what hif thoughts were\u2014his mind was 6enumbed and seemed to shvn refleetion, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014ho held almost unconsciously in hi\u017f hand a naked dagger of a particular constructjon, whieh had been found iri the hul. They were soan met by diffcrent parties who had been erigaged in the search of her whom a mother had missod. Their lamentable cries, as they approaehed the city, forewarned tho parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe tboir grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained lhc cause of their obild's death, they looked at Aubrey, clnd pointed to the eorse. They wcre inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and wcls often dolirious; in these intervals he would call vpon Lord Ruthven and up0n Ionthe\u2014by some unaccountclble combinatjon he seemed to beg ofhis former cornpanion to spare the being he loved. Al other times he would imprecote maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever motive, upon heorlng of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same hou\u017fe, and bccame his constant attcndant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and start1ed at the sight of him whose jmage he had now combiried with thot af a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, lmplying almost repentarice for the fault that had caused lheir separation, and stil1 more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ehangcd; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wha had so astonjshed Aubrey; but af soon as his convale\u017fcence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except tbat at times he wa\u017f surprifed to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, wilh a smile of malicious oxullation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this fmile haunted him. During the lclst stage of the inualid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently ongaged in watching the tide1ess waves raised by thc cooling breeze, or ln marking the progress of thoso orbs, circling, like our world, the movelefs sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wifh t0 avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's inind, by this shock, was rnuch weakened, and that elasticity of spiril wbich bad once so distingui\u017fhod him now seemed to houe fled for ever. He was now as much a lovcr of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished f0r solitude, his mind could not find jt in lhe neighbourhood of Atheris; if he sought il amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianlhe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sovght il in the woods, her ljght step would oppear waridering amidft the underwood, in queft of tbe modest violet; then suddenly turnirig rovnd, w0uld sh0w, to hif wild imagination, her palc face and w0unded throat, with a meek smile vpori her lips. He determinod to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assocjations iri his mjnd. He praposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during hif illness, that they shouldvisit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in euery directian, and sought every spot to whioh a recollection could bo attached: but thougb they thus hastcncd from placc to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upori. They heard much of robbers, but they graduolly began to slight these reports, whicb they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the gerierosity of those whoin they desended from pretended darigers. In conseqvence of thus neg1ectirig the advice of tho inhabitants, on one 0ccasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, bowever, o narrow defile, at the 6ottom of which was tbe bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock bravghl down from the neighbouring prccipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; farscarcely were the whole of thc party engoged in the narrow pass, when thoy were \u017ftartled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guris. In an instant their guards hcld left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in tho direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired sor a moment behind lhe sheltering tvrnof the defile: but clshamcd of being thus detainodby a foc, who with insulting shouts bade them a dvarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers fhould climb above and take them in the rear, they detormined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven reoeived a shot in the shovlder, which brought him lo the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no loriger heeding the contesl or his own peril, was soon surprised by seejrig the robbers' faoes around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Rvthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendcred.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded frlend to a neighbouririg cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presenco\u2014they 6eing content inerely to guard the entrance till thejr comrade should returri with the promised sum, for whioh he had an ordor. Lord Rutbven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seomed advancing with basty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of paln as he had been of the objects aboul him: but towards the close of the last evcning, hls mind became apparontly uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was iriduced to offer bis assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you maydo more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as l ittle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honovr.\"\u2014\"H0w? tell me how? I wovld do any thirig,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need hut little\u2014my life ebhs apace\u2014I cannot explain tbe wh0le\u2014but if you would co nceal all you know of me, my bonour werc free from stain in the warld's moulh\u2014and if my death were uriknown for soine time in Englond\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wilh exu1tant violcnce, \"Sweor 6y aIl your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death t0 any livirig being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillaw, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; lhe many circum\u017ftonces attonding his acquaintancc with this man ro\u017fe upon his mind, andhe knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiverlng came over him, as if froin the presentiment of something horrible awailing bim. Rising eorly in the mornlng, he wa\u017f about to enter thc hovel iri which he had left lhe corpse, wben a robher met him, ond informed him tbat it was no longer there, having been conueyed by himself and comrades, up0n his retiring, to tbe pinnacle of a neigbbouring inourit, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the sirst cold ray of the moon thot rose after bis death. Aubrey astonished, and taking severaI of tbe men, d etcrminod to go and bury lt upon the \u017fpot where it Iay. But, when hc had mounted to the summit he found no trclco of either thecorpse or the clothes, th0ugh the robhers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid theb0dy. For a timc his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurned,convinced that they had burled the carpse for the sake of the clolhes.\nWeary of a country ln which he had met with such terrible misforturies, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancholy that had seizod upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived al Smyrna. While waiting for a vesfel to convey him to Otranto, or ta Naples, be occupied himself in arrariging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other thjngs there was a case containing scvera1 weapons of offerice, more or les\u017f adaptcd to ensure lhe death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilsl turning them over, and examining tbeir curious forms, what was his \u017furprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as tbe dogger discovered in lhe fatal but\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain furtber proof, he sound lbe weapon, clnd his horror may bc imagined when he discovered that it fitted, t hough peculiarly shaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyef seemed to nced no further certainty\u2014they seernod gazing to he bound to the dagger; yet still hc wished to disbelieve; bvt the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, clnd left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left S myrna, and on his way home, clt Rome, his first lnquiries were concerning the lady he had atte-\nrnpted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivc orlf. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and fhe had not 6eenbeard of since the departure of his lordshjp. Aubrey's mind becarne almost hr0ken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He becarne morose and silerit; and hi\u017f only 0ccupation consjsted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if bo wcre going to save the lifc of fome one he beld dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to hjs will, soan wafted bim to the English sbores; and hehastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momcnt, appeared to losc, in the embraees and caresses of his sister, all inemory of tbe past. If she before, by her infanline caressef, had gcliried his affection, now that the woman began lo appear, she was stjll more attaching cls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey bad not thot winning grace which gains tho gclze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmont. Her blue eye wcls never lit up by the levity of the mind berieath. There wa\u017f a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misforturie, but fromsome feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul conscious of a hrighter realm. Her step was nol tbat light fo0ting, which strays where'or o butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014lt was fedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brather breathed to her bis afsection, and would in her presence forget tho\u017fe griefs she knew destroyed bis rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that af the voluptuary? It seemed as if tbose eyes,\u2014that facc were then playing in the lighl of tbeir own nalive sphere. She was yel only eighteen, arid had not been presentcd to the world, it having been thought 6y her guardians more fit that her presentation shouId be delayed until her brother's return from thc continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, rosolved thal the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, sh0uld be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his sathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered hirn. He covld not feel interest abouttbe frivolities os fashi-\nonable strangers, when his rnind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comsort to the protectionof bis sister. They s0on arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had nat been held for a long time, and all who were anxious lo bask in the smi1e of royalty, hastened thjther. Aubrey was there with hif sister. While he waf stariding in a c0rner 6y himse1f, heedless of all around him, engaged in the rememhrance that the first time he hod seen Lord Ruthuen was jn that very place\u2014be felt himself suddenly scized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had bardIy courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectrc thot would blost him, when heperceived, at a little distance, the some figure wbich had attracted hi\u017f notice on this spot upon his first eritryinto society. He gazed till hjs limbs alm o\u017ft refuslng to bcar their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a frjend, and forcirig a passage lbrough the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were 6ursting from his brclin. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstancos started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused hlmseIf, he could not belieue it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thougbt his imagination had conjured up the irnage his mjnd was resting upon. It was imp ossible tbat it covld be real\u2014he determined, therefore, ta go again into society; for though he altempted to ask eoncernirig Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he eould not succeed in gaining iriformation. He went a few nigbts after wilh his sister to lhe assembly of a near relatlon. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, andthere gave bimself up to his awn devovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leoving, he r0used himself, and entering anather room, found his sisler surrouridod by several, apparently in earnest conuersaliori; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, ond revealed to him tbose features hemost abhorred.Hc sprang forwclrd, sei2ed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, foroed her towards the stroet: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waitlng for their lords; and while he was engagcd inpassing them, he again heard that voice whisper clase to hiin\u2014\"Remernber your oatb!\"\u2014He did not dare to lvrn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached horne.\nAubrey became aImost distracted. If besore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complete1y was it erigrossed, nowthal the certointy of the monster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler's attentionswere now uriheeded, and il was in vain that she intreated him to explairi to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only ultcred cl few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starlled hirn;\u2014was he then to allow this rnonster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, arnidst all he held dcar, and not avert its progress? His very sistor might have been touched by him. But even if he were ta break his oath, and discl0se his suspioions, who would believe him? He thought of employing hjs own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered,had been alreody mocked. For days he remained ln this slate; shutup in his room, he saw no one, clnd ate only when his \u017fister came, wbo, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support naturc. At la\u017ft, no longer capableof bearing stlllncss and solitude, he lefl his houso, roamed from street ta street, anxi0us to fly that image wbich haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midriight damps. He was no longer to be recogriized; at first he returned with the evening lo the bouse; but at last he laid him down to rest wherover fatigue overtook him. His sister, arixious forhis \u017fafety, employod people to follow him; but they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any\u2014from thaught. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose prescnce they were unconscious, he determjned to enter again into s0ciety, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spjte of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intlmacy. But when be entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so ulsible, thot his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her s oke, a society which affected him so strorigly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to iriterpose, and, fearing lbat hi\u017f mind wa\u017f becoming olienated, they thought ithigh time to resume again that trust which hod been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and suffering\u017f he had daily encountered in his wariderings, arid of preventing hjm from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged o physician to reside in the house, and tako conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so complotely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His iricoherence becamo ot last so great, that he was canfined to his chamber. There he wov1d oflen lie for days, inoapa6le of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affeotion and recolleotion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his f ister; then he would sometiinesstart, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her nat to touch him. \"Oh, do not t0ueh him\u2014if your love for me is augbt, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his orily answer was, \"True! trvo!\" and again he sank into a state, whencc not even she could rouse him. This lasted many manths: gradua11y, however, cls the year was passing, his incoherences became less frcquent, and his mind lb rew off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guordians observed, that several times in the dcly he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tirne had nearly elapsed, when, upon the laslday of the year, one of his guardians cntering his room, bcgan to converso with his physicicln upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attentjon was atlracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad os this mark of returning intellect, of which thcy feared he bad been deprived, they montionod the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Au6rey seemed pleased, and astonished tbom still more by his exprcssing his jrilention lo he present at the riuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answored not, 6ut in a few minutef his sister was with him. He was apparently again capablo af being affected by the influerice of her louely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, ond kifsed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak witb all his wonted warmth, and to congratuIate her upon her marriage with a perfon so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what wos his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her asking bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her fvture hushand, he looked as if he did nol understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with cl sraritic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would riever wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could riot advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember hls oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of hls disorder, cntered, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, dc\u017fired her to leave him. He sell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of lhem lo delay hut for one day. They, attribvting this to the insonity they imagined had taken posscssion of his mjnd, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the mornlng after the drawing-room, and had been refused with euery one else.When he heclrd of Aubrey's ill health, he readily vnderstood himscls to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deeined irisane, his cxultation and p1easure could hardly be coricealod from those among whom he had gainod this information. He hastened to the house of his f0rmer companion,and, by constant attendance, and the pretence af great affeclion for lhe brother and interest inhis fate, he grodually won the ear of Mifs Av6rey. Who could resisl his power? His to ngue had danger\u017f ond toils torecount\u2014could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no fympathy witb any being on the crowded earth, sclve with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014couId tcll how, since be knew her, his exislence, had begun to seem worthy ofpreservation, if it were inere1y that he might liston to her saothing accenls;\u2014in fine, he knew so woll how to use lhe ferpent's art, 0r such was thc wilI of fate, that he gained her affectioris. The lit1e of the elder branch sallingat length to him, he 0btained on important embassy,which served as an excuse sor hastening the marrjage, (jn spite of her brother's deranged stato,) whjch was to take place the vcry day beforc his departure for lhe continent.\nAubrey, whon he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and papcr; it was given him; he wrote a 1elter to bis si\u017fter, coniuring her, as \u017fhe valued her own happinefs, ber own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and thehope of their house, to de1ay but for a fcw hours that marriage, on which he denounced the mostheavy cursos. The seruantf promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he tbought it betternot to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what be considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nighl passedon without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that rnay more casily be conceiued than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of cclrriages brokc up0ri hi\u017f ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity 0f the servants ot last overcame their vigilanee, they gradually stoIe away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old waman. He soi2ed the opportunity, with one bound wos out of the room, andin a rnomentfound hlmself in the apartment where all were nearly asfembled. Lord Ruthven wa\u017f the first to perceive him: ho immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried hjm from the raom, speech1ess with rage. When ori the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his e ar\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Wamen are fraiI!\" So sclyjng, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in search of bim. Au6rey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed lo bed. This was not mentioned lo hi\u017f sister, who was riot prefent when be eritered, as the physician was afraid of agitatirig her. The marrjclge was solemnized, and the b ride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakriess increased; thc effusi0n of blood produced symptom\u017f of the near approach of deatb. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader hos perused\u2014he djed immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Au6rcy's sister had glutted lhe thir\u017ft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, C0NTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The warld was all before him, where to choose his p1ace of rest, and Providenco his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one 0f his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in tbe island of thot name. Tbe beauty of this placc, and the certain supply of catlle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and mercharitmen; and though it lies rather out of lbe track for shi ps bourid to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilft the men were employed in watering, and the pursor bargajning for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had beenhcforo. On the brow of Mount Ida (a sma1l monticule so named) wo met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mity1ene, whe re I am likely lo get married. He was an odd, but a very good mon. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, be1ongs lo him, and he has left on old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wirie-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there a6out fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost na time iri hastenjng to tbe house where our countryman had resided. We wero kindlyroceived by an old man, who conducted us over the mansiori. It con\u017flsted of fovr apartments on the ground-flo0r\u2014an enlrance hall, a drawing-rooin, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simpIy decorated: plain green-stclined walls, marble tables on cilber side, a large myrtle in thecentro, and a small fountain beneoth, which covld be mode to play lhrough the branches by moving a spring sixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a largc couch or sofa completed the furniture. In thc ha1l stood haIf a do2en English cane cbairs, and an einpty book-case: there wero no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on tbe floor, with twa stuffed cottori quilts and a plllow\u2014the common bcd lhroughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled wlth books and papers, which were theri in cl large seclman's chest in the cIoset: it was open, but we did not think ourselvcs justified in exainining the contents. On thc tablet of the recess 1ay Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volncy's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Gerrnan language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's riovels; Sehiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets srom the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no Engljsh book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, writtenwith a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all 0ver, arid inarked with sljps of paper, on which a1so were remarks.\nThe ald man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sail-\ned, clnd forgot to place tbem with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unlil bjs return; for he is so p ortlculor, that were I to move one tbing withovt orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I onco did him a service; and I have the producc of lhjs farm for tbe trouble of taking care os it,exeept twenty zechines which I pay to anaged Armenian who resides in a small cottage iri the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for wbat reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externa1ly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen brood, and lhe fluted marble plllars with block plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were con\u017fiderabIy higher than the roof. The roof, surr0undedby a light stone balustrado, wa\u017f covered by a firie Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the hovse-lops are thvs furnished, as upon them the Greeks pa\u017fs their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, suchas \"lachryina chrisli,\" eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening bree2e.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small slr-\neamlet glidcd away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bufhes, a marble seat wlth an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whjch we were told, the 1ord pclssed many of his evenings clnd nigbts till twelve o'clock, reading, wrjting, and talkirig to himseIf. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout,\"and always atterided our chvrch twico a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThc view fr0m thi\u017f seat was what may 6e tormed \"cl bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led tbe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oli ve and myrtle trees in bloom, and on thc summit os which an ancicnt Greek tcmple appeared lri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descendcd in broken cascades, until it was lostin the woods near the mountain's ba\u017fo. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminate\u017f the vjew in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly obserued, studdirig the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed o view more than I did this; but our enqujries were fruitless as lo the name of the pe rson who had resided in thjs romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, bis bankor, who had gone lo Candia. \"The Armen ian,\" said our conductor, \"could tel1, but I am sure he wjll not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, o1d friend?\" faid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particularf of the ifolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. Ho gave a cow to one mon, horses to others, and cotton and silk to lhe girl\u017f who live by weaving the\u017fe articles. He also bovght a new boat for a fisherman who bad lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testarnerits to the poor child ren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to hove beena very eccentric and benevolent characler. One circumstance we learnt, whjch our old friend al the cottago thought propcr not to discIose. He had a most beautiful daughler, with whom tbe lord was often seen walking on the sea-shoro, and he had bought her a piano-s0rte, and taugbt her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmation with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylone; our imaginatlons all on lhe rack, guossing wh0 this rambler in Greece could bo. He had rnoney it was evident: he hod philanthropy 0f disposition, arid all those ecoentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued at Palerm0, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupi1 of WYATT'S, who had 6eenlravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so arixious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the islclnd of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then hcard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some yeors from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recIuse of Calcla ln every page. Deeply djd wc regret not having been more curiovs in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will riever return. I mclke thisstatement, believing it riot quite uninleresting, and in justice to his Iordship's good namc, wbieh has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as os an unfceling disposition, averse lo associating with human nature, or contribvting in any way ta sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as may be plainly gathered from theselittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of lhe heart, so elegclntly depicted jn hls lordsbip's poems, scem to bave their seat in hls bo\u017fom. Tenderricss, sympathy, and charity appear t0 guide all his actioris: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a beirig on whose heart Religian hoth set her scal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown ber mantle. No inan ecln read the proceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud afhim af a countryman. With respect to his l0ves or pleasures, I do not assvme a right ta give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caulion, particu larly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure lho errors of a fell0w-mortal. Lord Byron's character iswarthy of bis genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous beart and solf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleel-streel.","16":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy JohnWilliam Polidorj\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is faunded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabians jt appoars to be common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Grecks until afler the e\u017ftablishmenl of Christjanity; arid it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek chvrches; at which lime, the idea becomlng prevalent, that o Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed lhe subject af many wonderfvl stories, \u017ftill extant, of the dead rising from thejr graves, and feoding upon the blaod of the young ond beautjsul. In the Wost it spread, witb some slight variation, all over Hurigary, Poland, Auslria, and Lorraine, where the helief existod, that vampyres njghtly imbibed a certainportion of the blood of their victims, wbo became einaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human 6lood-suckers sattened\u2014and their velns became distended lo such a state of repletion, as to ccluse the blood to flow from all the pa\u017ffages 0ftheir bodics, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn thc London Jaurnal, of March, 1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credible account of a particvlar case of vampyri-\nsm, whicb is stated to have 0ccurred al Madreyga, in Hungary. It oppears, thal upori ari examiriation of the eommander-in-chief and magistrales of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named A rnold Paul, had 6een heard to say, that, at Cofsovia, on the fronliers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a wclyto rid himself of the evil, by eating some of tho earth 0ut af the vainpyre's graue, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaulion, however, did nol prevent him from becoming a vampyre himsclf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complairied of having been tormented by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been dcprived of Iife by his attacks. To p reuenl surther mischief, the lnhabitants having consulted lheir Hadagni, took up the 6ody, and found il (as ls supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof havi ng been tbus obtained, they resorted t0 the accustomedremedy. A stake was driven entirely through the hcart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had boen aliue. This done, they cut aff his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopled with the corses of tho\u017fe persons whobad previously died from vampyrism, lest thoy sbould, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a uampyre him\u017fe1s, and sucks iri his lurn.\nChief bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better odapled to illustrate the subjcct of the present observotions than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishmerit after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in exiftence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to lhose beings he loved most while upon oarth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindr ed and affection.\u2014A supposilion alludcd to in tbe \"Giaour.\"\nBut firston earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse sholl from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the ftreain of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid ljvirig corse, Thy victims,ere they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are wltbered on the ftem. But one tbat f0r thy crime must fall, The youngest, best belovedof all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014hcr eye's last spclrk, And the last glassy glance must view Whicb freezes o'er its lifcless blue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Df which, in life o lock when shorn Affeotjon's fondest pledge waf worn\u2014 But now is bome away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shclll drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Ti1l thesc jn horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also intr0duoed in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre oorse of the Arabian inajd Oneiza, wh0 if represented cls having returned frorn the grave farthe purp0se of tormenting him she best lovedwhilst in exislence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted froin the sinfulness of her Iife, she being pourtrayed throvghout the whole of the tale as a complete type os pur ity and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefart giues a long account ln his travels 0s severaI astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretendf to have beeri on eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a va riety 0f anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prave it to be a classical, as well as harbaricln error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices ori this singularly horrible superstiliori might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, nccessarily devoted to explanation, and wbich may now be concluded by merely remarking, that tbough the term Varnpyre is the onc in most general acceptation, there are seueral olhers synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened lhat in tho midst of the dissipations ottendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of lhe leaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularitles, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe llght laughter of the fair only attracled his attention, that he mighl by a look quell it, and tbrow fear into tbose breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this fenscltion of awe, could not explain whence it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object'f face, did not seem to pcnetrate, and at one glance topierco tbrough lo theinward workings of the heart; but fell upon thc cheek with a 1eaden ray that woigbed upon lhe skin it cauld not pass. His peculiaritios caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustamed to violenl excitement, and now fe1t the weight of ennuj, wore pleased at hauirig something ln their presence capable 0f engagjng their attenlion. In spitc of tho deadIy hue of bis face, which never galneda warmer tint, either from the hlush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, lhough ils forin and outllne were beautiful, many of the female hunlers after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of wbat tbey mighl term affectiori: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe mockery 0f evory monster shcwn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but pul on thc dress of a movntebank, to clttract his notiee:\u2014though in vain:\u2014whon fhe stood before him, though bi\u017f eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014evon her unappalIed impudence wcls baffled, and she left the field.But though the common aduItress cou1d not infIuenco even the guidanoc of his eyes, it was not that thc femole sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which be spoke tothe virtuous wife and lnnocent daugbter, that few knew he ever addressed hjmself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and whether it was that il even overcame the dread of his singular character, 0r that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, bo wa\u017f cls often among lhose females who form the boast os their sox from their domestic virtues, as among those who svlly it by their vices.\nAbout thc same time, therc came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in tho possession af gr eat wealth, by parents who died wbile he was yet in childbood. Left olso to himself by guardiclns, who thought il their duty merely to take care of his forlune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenory subaltern\u017f, he cul tivated more hjs imagination than his judginent. He hcld, hence, that high romantic fee1ing of bonour and candour, which daily ruins so many milllners' apprenticef. He belioved a1l to sympathife wjth virtue, and lhought lhal vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the soene, as we see in romances: he thought tbat the misery os a cottage merely consisted jn the vosting of clothes, which were as warm, but whicb were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patohes. He thought, in firie, tbat the dreams of poetf wero the realities of life. He was handsome, frank,and rich: for these reosonf, upon his enterjng irito the goy circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whjcb sbou1d defcribe with leasl truth lheir languishing or romping favovrites: the daughters al the same time, by lheir brightening countenances wheri he approaehed, and by their sparkling eyef, when he opened his lips, soon led him into falfe notions of his talents clnd his merit. Attacbed ashe was to the romance of his solitary hours, he waf startled at firiding, that, except in the to1low and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of fnuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictu res and descriptions conlained in those volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensatjon in his grcltified vanity, he was about to rolinquish his dreains, when the extraordinary being we have above descrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; ond the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fow olher signs of hjs observation of oxternal objects, than the tac it assent to tbeir existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatlon to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon f ormed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to o6serve the offspririg of hi\u017f fancy, rather than the person before hiin. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was olways recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs werc embarrassed, and soon found, frorn the notes of prepara-\ntjon iri \u2014 Street, that he was about to t rave1. Desirous of gaining some insormation respecting this singuIar character, who, till now, hcld only whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians, lhat it was time for him t0 pcrform the tour, which for many generations has becn thought necessory to enablo theyoung to toke some rapid steps in the caroor of vice towards pvtting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and riol al1owing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous jntrigues are mentioned as tbe subjects of pleasantry or of prclise, aocording lo the degrec of skil1 shewn in carrying them on. They consenled: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, wos surprised to receive from him a proposal to join bim. Flattercd bysuch a mark of esteem from hlm, who, apparently, hcld nothing in camrnon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherta, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studyjrig Lord Ruthveri's cbaracter,and now he found, that, though inariy more of hif actions were exposed to bis view, the refults offered difforerit cariclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compani0ri was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the ldle, the vclgabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than en0ugh ta relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indlgen ce by the misfortunes attendant euen upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014lhese were sent from the door wjth hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lvst, or lo sink him slill deeper in his iniquity, he was sont away wilh rich charity. This wa\u017f, however, attributed by him to tbe greator importunity of thc vicious, which generally preuclils 0ver the retiring bashfulnefs af the virtuovs indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upori whom il was bestowed, inevitablyfound that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the mast abj ect mifery. At Brussels and other towns throvgh which they passed, Aubroy wa\u017f \u017furprized at the apparent eagerness with which his compclniori sought for the centrcs of all fashlonable vico; there he entered into all the splrit of the fara table: he betted, and alwayf gamhled with svccess, except wherethe known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even moro than he gained; but it was alwclys with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around:it was not, however, so whon he encountered thc rash y0uthful novice, or the lvckle ss fclther of a numerous family; then his vcry wish seemed sortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind wcl\u017f laid aside, and bls eyes sparkled with more fire than thclt of the cat whilst dallying with the h alf-dead mouse. In evory town, he left the formerlyaffluent youth, tom from the circ1e he adorned, cursirig, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a fathcr sat frantic, ainidst the speaking Iooks of mute hungry childreri, without a singlo farthing of his late immcnse wealth, wherewith to buy even svffieient to satisfy their present cravirig. Yet he took no money from lhe gambling table; bul immediately l0st, lo the ruiner of mariy, the last gilder he had just snatehed from tho c0nvuls ive grasp ofthe inriocent: this inighl but be the result of a certain degree of kn0wledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of themore experionced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to hjs friend, and beg him to resign that charity arid pleosure whicb provedthe ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; howevor, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild ond rich sconos af nature, was always the same: his eye \u017fpoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near tbe object of his curiofity, he obtainod no greater gratificcltion from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break tbat mystery, which to his oxalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for o time lost sigbt of his c ompanion; he left him in doi1y attendance upon the mornjng ciroIe of an Italian countes\u017f, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrlved frorn England, which he opened with eager impatience; thefir\u017ft was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the otbers were from his guardians, lhe latter ast0nished him; if it had before entered inlo his imagiriatiori that there wcls an evil power residcnt in his companion, these seeined to give him sufficient reason for the bolief. His gvardians insistcd upon hisjmmediately lcaving his friend, and urged, tbat his character was dreadfully vici0us, for that the possession as irresistible powers of sedvction, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress hcld not originated in hatrod of her charactor; but that he had required, to enhance his gratisicatiori, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, s hould bc hurled srom lhepinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradalion: in fine, that aIl those females whom he had s0u ght, apparently on account of their virtue, had, sincc his departure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the wh0le deformity of their vices lo the pu6lic goze.\nAubrey dcterinined upon leclving one, whose character had not yet shown cl singlo bright point ori which to rest the eye. Hc rosolved to lnuent some plausible pretext far abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more clasely, andto let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered intothe same circle, and soon perceivcd, tbat his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of lhe lady whose house he cbiesly frequented. In ItaIy, it is seIdom that an vnmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged to carry onhis p1ans in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignati0n had been appointcd, whjch wovld most likely end iri the ruin of an innocent, thovgh thoughtlcss glrl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruplly asked him hjs inten tions with respeclto the lady, informing him at tho same time that hc wa\u017f aware af his being clbout to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended lo marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wrjting a note, to say, that from that rnoment he must dec line aceompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of clll he knew, not only with regclrd to her daughter, but also coneernlng the choracter af his Lardship. The assignation was prevenled. Lord Ruthven next dcly merely sent bis servant to n0tify his complete assent to a separation; bvt did not hint any suspicion of bis plans having been foiled by Aubrey'\u017f interposition.\nHaving left Rame, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in thc house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traeing the faded records of aricierit glory upon monuments that apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling the deods of freomen only before slaves, hcld hidden themselves beneath thc shellering sojl or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so bcautiful and delicale, thal sbe might have forrned the model for a pairiter wlshing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the fajthfvl in Mahamet's pclradise, save thclt her eyes spoke too much mind for any 0ne to think she could beIo ng to those who had n0 souls. As she danoed upon the plain, or tripped along the mouritain's side, one would hove thought the gazolle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, clpparently lhe eye of animatod nature, sor that sleepy luxurious l0ok of the animal suitod but to the taste of on epicure. The light step os Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in hls search after aritiquities, and often would theunconscious girl, engaged in the pursvil of a Kashinere buttersly, show the whole beauly of her form, floating a\u017f it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, wh0 forgot the letters he bad just decyphered uponan almost effaced tablet, in the contemplotion af ber sylph-llke sigure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such deljcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the fo rgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape srom his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Paufariias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innoeence, youth, and beauty,unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling bal1s. Whilst he drew those remains of whjch he wished to preserve a memorial for bis future hours, she would stand by, and watoh the magie effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe ta him the circ-\nling dance upori tbe open plain, would paint, to him in al1 the glowing colours of youthful mcmory, the marriage pomp she remembercd viewing iri her infancy; and then, turning to subjeots that had evidenlly mclde a greater impression upon her mind, wou1d lell him all the svpernatural tales of her nur\u017fe. Her earriestness and apparent belief of what she narroted, excited the inlerest even af Aubrey; and osten as she told him the tole of the living vampyr e, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest lies, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for lhe ensuing montbs, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idlc and h0rriblc fantasies; but Iclnthe cited ta hiin the names of old meri, wbo had at last detoctod one living among themselves, after several of their near relatjves clnd children had been faund marked with the stamp of the fiend's clppetite; and when \u017fhe found him so incredvlous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remclrked, that thosc who hod dared to question their existence, always had some proof giveri, whioh o6llged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to consess it was true. She detailed to him the traditlonal appearance of these monfters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pret ty accurate descrlption of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that thcre could be no truth in her fears, though clt the \u017fame time he wondered at tbe many coincidenoes which hcld all tended t0 excite o belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Ruthvcn.\nAubrey began to attaeh himself more and more to Ianlhe; her innoccnce, so contrasted with aIl the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sougbt for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed tbe idea of a young man of Engli\u017fb ha6its, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found him\u017felf more and morc attached to the almost falry form before him. He would toar him\u017felf at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, be would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible ta fix his altention upon the rvins oround him, whilst in his mind he relained an imago that secmed alone the rightful possessor of bis lhoughts. Iari the was unconseious of his love, and was ever the same frank irifantile being he had firft known. She always seomed to parl from him wilb reluctance; bul it was because she had no longer any one with whorn she could uisit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appea1ed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they 6oth, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, palc wjth horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon orie of his excursions, which was t0 detain him for a few hovrs; whcn they heard the name os the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at nighl, os he inust necessari1y pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler the day had c1osed, upon any consideration. They described it as the rosort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy eviIs as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to lclugb them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excurslon unattended; he waf surpriscd to observe the meloncholy face of his host, and was eoncerned to find lhat his wards, mocking the belief ofthose horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about t0 deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earneslly begged of him to return, ere nigbt allowod the power 0f these bejngs lo be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, howeuer, so occupied in his research, tbat he did not pe rceive thal day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, ln the warmer climates, so rapjdly gather into a tremendous mass, and paur all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is olmost unknown; immediately the sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he hod advanced far, the power of the storm wcls above\u2014its echoing thundcrs had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain farced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemcd to fall and radiate at his vcry feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through theeritangled forest. Theanimal al last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glclre of lightnirig, thal he wcls in the neighbourhood of a bouel thal hardly lifted jtself up from the mas\u017fes ofdead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismountirig, he approached, hoping to find sorne one to guide him lo the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, tho thunders, for a momerit silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shriek\u017f of a woman mingling with the stifled, cxultant mackery of a laugh, contiriued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by lhe thunder which again r0lled over his hoad, he, with a sudden effort, forced 0pen the door of the hut. He fourid hlrnself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continucd, and no notice was takeri of him. He fovnd himseIf iri oontact with samo one, whom he immediately feized; when a voice oried, \"Again haffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by one wbose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dear1y as heoould, he strvggled; but it was in vain: he was ljfted from his feet and hurled with enormovs force again\u017ft the ground:\u2014his enemy threw hjmself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up0n his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole lhat gavo light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving hjs prey, rushed through the door,and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke lhrough the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the 1lght of thejr lorches fell upon the mud wallf, andlhe thatch loaded on evcry individval straw with heavy flakes os soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted birn hy her cries; he was again left in darknes\u017f; but what was his horror, wheri the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his sajr conductress brought in a Iifeless corse. He shut hjs eyes, hoping that it was bul a uisi0n arising from his disturbed imagjnation; but he again saw the same form, wben he unclosed them, stretched by hi\u017f side. There was no colour upori ber oheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness ahout hor face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwell therc:\u2014up0ri her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the inen pointed, crying, simultaneausly struck with horrar, \"A Vainpy-\nrc! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly farmed, and Aubreywas laid by the sidc of her who had Iate1y been to him the obiect of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower af life that had dicd within her. He knew not what his thoughts werc\u2014hjs mind was benumbed and seoined to shun reflection, and take refugo in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a partjcular construction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by differerit parties wha had 6een engaged in the search of her whom a mather hod missed. Theirlamentable eries, as they approached the city, forewamod the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe thejr grief would be impossihle; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to tho corse. They were inoonsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these jntervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountab1e combination he seemed to beg of hjs former companion to spare tbe being he loved. At ather times he wo uld imprecate maledictioris upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, cbanced at this tjme to arriue at Athens, and, from whalever motiue, upon hearing of the ftclte of Aubrey, imrnediately placed himself in the same house, and became his con\u017ftarit attendant. When the lotter recovered from his delirivm, he was horrified ond startlod at the sight of him whose image he had now combined withthat os a Vampyre; but L0rd Ruthven, by bis klnd words, implying almost repentance for the fault that hod cavsed tbeir separatian, and still inore by lhe attention, clnxiety, and care which he showcd, soon rec onciled him to his presence. His Iordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic belng who had so astonifhed Aubrey; but os \u017faon as his c0nvalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceiued rio difserence from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gazc sixed jntently upon him, with a smjlo of malicious exultotion playing upon his lips: he knew nol why, but this sinile haunted him. During the last stage of the irivalid'\u017f recavery, Lord Ruthvonwas apparently engaged in watcbing the tid eless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, 0r iri markirig the progress of those orbs, circling, like 0ur world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish t0 clvoid tbe eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which hcld once so distinguished him now seemed to bave fled for ever. He was now as mvch a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rutbuen; but much as he wished for salitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Alhens; if he sought it amidst the ruin\u017f he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his \u017fide\u2014if he sought it in lhe woods, her light \u017ftep would appear wondering amidst the underwood, in quest of the rnodest uiolet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to bis wjld jmagination, her pale face arid wounded thro at, with a moek smile upon her lips. He determined to sly scenes,every feature af which created such bitter associations in hismind. He proposed to L0rd Ruthven, to whom he heldhimself bourid by the tender care he had taken of hirn dvring his illness, thal they should visil th0se parls of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollcction could be attached: 6ut though they thus hclsteried from place to place, yet they seemed not t0 heed what thcy gazed upon.They heard much of robbers, but they graducllly began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, wh0se interest lt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus neglecting the advjce of the inhabitarits, on one occasion they travelled with 0nly a fow guards, more to scrve as guides than as a defence. Upori entering, howover, a narrow defile, at tbe bottom of which was lhe bed os a torrent, with large masse\u017f of rock brought down from the neig hbouring precipices, they had reason ta repent their negligence; for fcorcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they wcre startled by the whistling of bullets close to thelr beads, and by the ec hoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselvcs behlrid rocks, had 6egun to fire in tbe direotion whence the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retircd for a moment behind the \u017fheltering turn 0f the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who wilh insultirig shouts bode them advanee, and being exp0sed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and lake them in the rear, they determinedat once to rush forword in sear ch of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven receiued a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistarice; ond, rio longer heedirig the contesl ar his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately tbrown vp their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbovring cabiri; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by tbeir presonce\u2014they being cont ent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should returri witb the promised sum, for which he hcld an order. Lord Ruthven'\u017f strerigth rapidly decreased; in two days inortisication ensued, and dea th seemed advancingwith hasty steps. His conduct and appearance bad riot changed; he sceined as unconsclous of pain as he had becn of the objects about him: but towards the cl0se of the last evening, his mind hecame apparently uneasy, orid his eye often fixed upori Aubrey, who was induced to offer hif assistance with more than usual earneslriess\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed tbe death ofmy existonce as little a\u017f that of the passing day; bul you may save my h ori0ur, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need bvt litlle\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all yau know of me, my honour were free from stairiin the world's mouth\u2014and if iny dcatb were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be knowri.\"\u2014\"Swcar!\" cried lhe dying man, raisirig himself with exuItant violence, \"Swear by all y0ur soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear lhat, for a year and a day you wjll n0t impart your knawledge of my crimes or death to any livjng6eing ln any way, whatever may bappen, or wbatever you may see. \"\u2014Hiseyes \u017feemed bursting from lbeir sookets: \"I fwear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk loughjng upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acqvclintanoe with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his aath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presenliment of somelhing horrible awaiting him. Rising ear1y in the morning, he wasabout to enter the hovel in whicb he had lefl the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been eonveyed by bimseIf and comrades, upan his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hjs lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray af the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking seueral of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he fourid no trace ofeither the carpse or the clothes,though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which theyhad laid thc body. For a tjme hif mlnd was bewildered in eonjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that lhey bad buried the oo rpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of o country in wbich he had met with such terrible misf0rtunes, and inwhich all appclrently oonspired to heighten that fuper\u017ftitious melancholy that had sei2ed upon his mind, he resalved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whi1e waiting for a vefsel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had witb him bel0nging to Lord Ruthven.Ainongst other things there was a case conlaining several weapons of offence, more or less odapted to ensure tho death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst tvrning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the saine style as the daggor discavered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hasteriing to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovercd tbat it fitted, thougb peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no furtber certainty\u2014they soemed gazing to bo bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the hoft and \u017fh eath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood ori each.\nHe loft Sm yrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquirief were concerning the lady hc had altempled ta snalch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rvined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's inind became almost broken vrider so many repeated horrors; he was ofraid that this lady had fallen a victim tothe dostroyer of Iantho. He became moro\u017fe and silent; and his only occupalion consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if be were going ta save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hjm to the Eng1ish shores; and he hastened to the mansi0n of his sathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces arid caresses of bis sister, all rnemory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a coinpanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applauseof the drawing-room assemblies. There wos riorie of that ligbtbrilljancy which 0nly exists in the heatedatmo\u017fphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levily of the mlnd beneath. Therc was a molancholy charm about it which did not seem toarife from misf0rtune, but from some feeling wjthin, thclt appeored to iridicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was nat that light footing, which \u017ftrays where'er a butter fly or a colour may attract\u2014jt was sedate and penfive. When alone, her face wcls never brightened by the smile of joy; bvt when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her prefericc forget th0se griefs she kriew destroyed his rest, who would hove exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuclry? It feemed as if those eyes,\u2014thal face were then playing in tbe light of their own native sphere. She was yeton1y eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it hoving been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brolher'\u017f relvrn from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, thcrefore, resolved that the next drclwjng-room, which was fast approaching, should be lhe epocb of her entry irito the \"busy soene.\" Aubrey would ratber have remained in the mansion os his father\u017f, and fed upon the meIancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fa shionoble strangcrs, whcn his mind had been fo torn by the evenls be bad witnessed; but he determincd la sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of bis sister. They s0on arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been annovnced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd wos excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not beeri held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in lhe smlle of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standirig in a corner by himself, heedlcss of all arourid him, engaged in the remembrance thclt the firsl tiine he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plclce\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, al a little distonce, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his firftentry into society. He gazed tlll hjs limbs almost refusing to boar lheir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, clnd was driven home. He pclced lhe room with hurried steps, and fixed his handsvpon his head,as lf he were afrajd hi\u017f thoughts were bvrsling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believo it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought hls imaginatiori hadconjured up the image his mind wasresting upon. It was impossihle lhat it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, t0 go again into socioty; for though he attemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insorination. He went a sew nights after with his sistcr to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the proteclion of a matron, he retired into o reccss, and there gave himself up to his own dcvavring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, thclt rnany were leavirig, he rovsed hjmself, clrid entering another room, found his sister surrounded 6y several, apparently in oomest conver\u017fation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when orie, whom he roquested to m0ve, turned round, and reveclled to him lhofofeatures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifter's arm, and, with hurried stcp, forced hor towards the street: at lhe door he found bimself impeded by the crowd os servants who werewaiting far their lords; and whilc he was engaged in possing them, he again heard that uoiee whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your ocltb!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister,soon reached home.\nAubrey becamo cllmost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by orie fubject, how inuch more complctely waf il engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sistcr's attentions were now unheeded, and lt was iri vain tbat she intreated him ta explajn ta her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a fow words, and t hose terrified hcr. Tho more he tbought, the mare he was bewildered. His oath startled bim;\u2014was be lhen to allow lhis morister to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, amjdst all he held dear, and not averl its progress? His very sister might bave been touched by him. But even if bo were to break his oath, and di\u017fclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He tbought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he reinembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only wbon his sister oame, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At lasl, no longer capable of bearlng stillnesf and solitu de, he left his h0use, roamed from street ta ftreet, clnxious to fly that image which hourited him. His dress became neglected, and hc wandered, cls often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He was no longcr to be recognized; at first he returned wilh the everiing to the houfe; but at last he 1aid him down to rest whereuer fatjgue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow hjm; but tbey were soon distanced by bim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abfence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of wbose presence tbey were unconfclous, he determined to cnter again irito society, and watch him closely, anxiousto forewarn, in spite of hif oath, oll whom Lord Ruthven approached witb intirnacy. But wben he entered int0 a room, his haggard and suspicious looks woro so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, tbat his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seekjng, for ber sake, a society whlch affected him so strongly. Wben, howover, reinonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allonated, they thovght it higb time to res urne agaln that trust which had been before irnposcd upori thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of sclving hlm froin thc injuries and sufferings he had daily cncountered in his wanderings, and of prevent ing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what thoyconsidcred folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take eonstant core of bim. He hardly appeored to notice it, so completely was his mlnd abs0rbed by one lerrible subject. His iricoherence became at last so great, that he was confjned to his chamber. Tbere he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaclated, his eyes had atlairied a glassy luflre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollccti0n remaining displayed itsclf upon the entry ofhif sister; then he would sometimes starl, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her riot totouch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Wbcn, however, shc inquired to wbom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! lrue!\" and agajn he sank into a state, whence n0t even she could rouse him. This lastod many months: gradually, howeuer, as the year was possjng, his incoherences became lefs frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whi1st hisguardians observed, that several llmes iri the day hc would c0unt upon his fingers a desinite number, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsod, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his gvardiaris entering his ro0rn, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when bis sisler was going riext dcly to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad os tbis mark of returning inteIlect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they meritioned the name of the Eorl of Marsden. Thinking tbis was a yovng Earl whom he had met with in society, Au6rey seemed pIeascd, and clstonished them stjll more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered nol, but in a few minutes his sister waswith him. He was apparently agairi capable of being offected hy the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her lo his breast, and kissod her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more olive to the feelings of affection. He begon lo speak with allhis w0nted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriago with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster wbo had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm 0f rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon hor afking him why he thus destroyed the resembla-\nnce os ber future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gclzing on her with a frantic expressiori of eounteriance, he bade her swear tbclt she would never wed this monsler, f0r he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if tbat voice again badehim remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no ane. In lhe meantirne the guardiclnf arid physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this wasbut a return of his djsorder, enlcred, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of thcm ta dolay bul f0r one day. Thoy, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken posscssion of bis mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had c a11ed lhe morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Wben he heard of Avbrey's ill health, he reodily under\u017ftood himself to be the causo of it; but when he learned thclt he was deemed insane, his exultation and pIeasure could hardly be concealed srom those ainong wh0m he had gained this information. He hastenedto the house of bis former companion, and, by constant altendanco, and the pretence of great affection sar the brother and lnterest in his fate, he gradvally won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to recount\u2014could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014covld tcll bow, since he knew her, his existence, had beguri ta seem worlhy of presorvation, if itwere inerely thal he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of sate, that he gairied her affections. Thc tille of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an exouse for hastening themarriage, (in spite 0f her brother's deranged state,) which wos to take place the very day before his departure for the contirient.\nAuhrey, when he was left by the physician arid bis guardians, attempted to bribe tho servclnts, but iri vain. He askcd for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrotea lettor to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happ iness, her own honour, and the honour of those now inlhe grave, who once held her in their arms as thoir hope and the bope of their hovsc, to delay but for a sew hours that marriage, on w hich he denounced thc most heavy cursos. The seruant\u017f promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, ho thought il better not to harass ariy more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whot he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may moro easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound os carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at lastovercame their vigilance, they gradual1y stole awoy, leclving hiin in the custody of an helpless old womcln. He \u017feized the opportunity, with one bound was out af tbe room, and ln a inoment found himself in tbe apartmenl where all werc noarly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hlm: he immediately opproclohed, arid, takirig his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless wlth rage. Wben on the staircase, L0rd Ruthvenwhispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dish0noured. Women are frail!\" So soying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by thc old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vont, had brokeri a blood-vessel, and he was eonve yed to bed. This was not mcntioned to his sister, wha was not prcfent when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. Tho marriage was solemnized, arid the bride and 6ridegroom lost London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of 6l0od produced symptoms of the near approach 0f deoth. He desired his sister's guardlans might be called, and wheri the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly whal the reader hcls perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MIT-\nYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wa\u017f all before bim, where to ehaase his place of rest, and Providerice his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, on board one of his Majosty's vesself, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of tbat name. The boauly of this place, and the ccrtairi supply of oattle and vegetobles always to be had there, induce many British vessel\u017f to visit it\u2014both men 0f war and merchclritmen; arid though il lies rather out of the track for ships bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply rcpay for the deviation of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom 0f the boy, ond whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargoining for cattle with tbe natives, the clergy-\nman arid myselftook a rambleto the cave called Homer's School, and other places, whore we had heen before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small moriticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English Iord, wh0 left the i\u017flond sour day\u017f preuious to our a rrivcll iri bif felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose ta quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He wcls an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over tbe hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he bas left an 0ld man in charge of it: he gave Domiriick, the wine-trader, \u017fix hvndred zoohinef for il, (about L250 English currency,) and has re\u017fjded there about sourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucoa very 0ften to tbo different islands.\"\nThis aec0unt excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house whcre our countryman had resided. We were kindly r eceivod by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments 0n the ground-floor\u2014on cntrance hclll, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decor ated: plain green-stained walls, marble tabIes on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to plcly through the branches 6y moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronzc Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stoodhalf a dozen English cane choirs,and an empty book-case: there wore no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a lclrge mattress sproad on the floar, with two stuf-\nfed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room wc observod a mclrble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large seamari's chest in the closet: il was open, but we did n0t think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the GermanIanguage; Klopstock's Mc \u017fsiah; Kotzebue's nouels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Coristantin0ple, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these boaks were filled wjth marginal notcs, wrltteri with a pencll, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was ljterally scribbled all ovor, and marked with slips of paper, on whicb also were remarks.\nThc old mari said: \"The lord bad been rcading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with tho 0thers; bvt,\" said he, \"there they must lie until hls retum; for he is so particular, that were I to move one tbing without 0rders, he would frawn upori me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the prodvoe of this farmf0r the trouble of taking care of it, except twentyzecbincs which I pay to an aged Armonian who resides in a small eottclge in tbe wood, and wbom the l0rd brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house cxternally was pleasing. Thc portico in front was fifty paces longand fourleen 6road, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths ond fret-work cornjces, (as it is n0w customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded 6y a Iight stone balu\u017ftrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-lops are thus furnished, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying theevening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided away, grapes, orangcs and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two largc myrtle bushe\u017f, a marble soat with an ornamental woodenback was plclced, on wbich we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" faid tbc old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always clttended our church twice a week, be sides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye uiew.\" A line of rich vineyards led the oye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the fummit of wbich an ancicnt Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smoll streom issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades,until it was lost in the woods near the mountajn's base. The \u017fca srnooth as glass,and an h0rizon unshadowod by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little ori the left, throvgh a uista of lofty chcsnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, sludding thelight blue wave with spots of emorald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did thjs; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the riame of the person who had resided in tbis romantic solilude: none kncw hls name but Domiriick, his banker, who bad g0ne to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" faid our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he wil1 nol,\"\u2014\"And cannot you lell, old friend?\" sclid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our retvrn lo the town we learnt \u017feveral partioulars of the isolated lord. He had porlioned eighl young girls when be was last upon the islarid, arid everi dclnced with them at the nuplial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who live by weavlng these artioles. He also bought a new hoat for a fisherman who had lost his awri in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamentsto the poor childreri. In short, he appeared lo us, from all we collected, to have bcen a very eccentrie ond benevolent character. One circum\u017ftance we learnt, wbich our old friend at tbo cottage thought proper riot ta discloso. He had a most beautiful daughter, wlth whom the lord wcls often seen walking on tbe sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and tavght hor himself the use of it.\nSuch was the lnformation with which we dcparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who thif rambler in Greece covld be. He bad money it was evident: he had philanthropy of dispositlon, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrlved at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fcllling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, cl pupjl af WYATT'S, who had bcen travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The jridividual,\" said he, \"about whom yov are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in iny travcls on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visitod him at Mityleno.\" We had neverthen heard of his lordshlp's faine, as we had been some years from home; but \"C hllde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recogriized the recluse of Calcla in overypage. Deeply did we regret not having becn more cu rious in our researches at the cattage, but we oonsoled ourselves wilh the ldea of returning to Mitylene on some futvre day; but to me that day will never retvrn. I make this statement, 6elieuing it not quite uniriteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, whioh has beeri grossly slandered. Ho has bocn descri6ed as af an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, ar contributing in ony way to sooth its sorrows, 0r add to its pleasures. The faet is directly the reuerse, as may be plainly gathered from these llttle aneedotes. All the fjner feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted iri his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bos0m. Tenderness, sympathy, arid charily appear to gujde all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reasari for inclrking him as a being on whose hoart Religion hath set her sea1, and over whose head Bencvolence hoth thrown her mantle. No man can readthe preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him a\u017f a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do nolassume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particvlarly whcn directed ogainst man's moral integrlty; and ho who dares jv\u017ftify himself before that awful tribunal where all must clppear, alone may censure the errors af a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in fecret, and shvnthe wor1d's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","17":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which thi\u017f tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until oster the establishment of Chriftianity; and it has only assumcd its prcserit form since the divisjon of the Latin and Greek churches; at which tirne, the idea becoming prevalcnt, thclt a Lat in body could not corrupt if burjed in lheir territory, lt gradually increased, and sormed the subiect of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feedirig upori lhe blood of the young and beautifuI. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all ouer Hungary, Polan d, Auslrio, and Lorrajne, wbere tbc belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portiori of the b1ood of their victims, who became emaoiated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattencd\u2014and their ueins became distendod to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of tbcir skinf.\nIn the Londori Journal, af March, 1732, is a curiovs, arid, of courfe, crediblo accovnt of a particular case of vampyrism, whicb is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It appears, that upon ari examiriation af thc cornmonder-iri-chlef and magistrates of the place, they positively and vnariimously affirmed, that, abovt five years before, a certain Heyduke, nained Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, 0n the frontiers os the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himseIf of the evil, by eating some os tho earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not preverit bim from hecoming a vampyre himself; for, about twonty or thirty days after his deoth and burial, many personscomp1ained of having been tormented by him, and cl depasitiori was mado, that four persans had been deprjved af life by his attacks. To prevent further mischjef, the inhabitants havirig consulted their Hadagni, took up tho body, and found lt (as is svppo\u017fed to be usual iri cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entiroly free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid bIood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the aocustomcd remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and 6ody of Arnold Paul, at which ho is ropo-\nrted to havc cried oul as dreadfuIly as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned hls body, and threw the ashesinto hi\u017f grave. Tho same measures were adopted with the corses of those por\u017fons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others wbo survived them.\nThe vniuersal belief is, thal a person sucked by a vampyre beoomes a varnpyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nTbis mon\u017ftrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations thari any other instarice which could be adduced. In rnany part\u017f os Greece it is considered asa s0rt of punishmenl after dealh, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existenee, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, bul compelled to confirie his infernaI visitations \u017folely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A fupposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut firft on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall srom its tomb be rent; Tben ghastly havnt the native place, And suck lhe bload of all thy race; There from thy daugbter, sist er, wife, At midnight drain lhe stream of life; Yet loothe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yel expiro,Shall kri0w thc deman for their sire; As cursing t hee, thou cursing them, Tby flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The yovngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a fatber's name\u2014 Thclt ward sball wrap tby heclrt in flame! Yet thou must end tby task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last gla\u017fsy glancc must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless 6lue; Thcn with unhall0wed hand shall tear Tbe tressef of her ycl1ow hair, Of which, in life a lock whcn shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Meinorial of thine agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullcn grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls ond Afrits rave, Till thcso in h0rror shrink away From spectre more occvrsed than they.\nMr. Southey has olso introduced in his wild but beavtiful poem of \"Tbalaba,\" the vclmpyre corse ofthe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned frorn the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in oxislence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted sram the sinfulnoss of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as o complete type of purity and inriocence. Thc veraciaus Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of \u017feveral astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to havc been an eyewitnes\u017f; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject,bosides a variety of anocdotes, and traditionary riarrotives jllustrative os its effects, has pvt f0rth some learned dissertcltions, ten-\nding to prove it t0 6e a classical, af well as barbarian orror.\nMany curious and interesting notiees on this singularly horrible superstition rnight be added; tbough the present may suffice for the limits 0f a notc, necessarily dev0ted to oxplanation, and which may now bc c0nc1uded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one jnm0st general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brouc0loka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried lhat in tbe midst of tbe dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the Ieaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for hif singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as is he could not participale tberein. Apparently,the light lavghter of the foir only atlracted his attention, that he might by a loak qucll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessnoss reigned. Those wbo folt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed il to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did n0t sccm to penctrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward workings of the beart; bvt fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that wejghed upon tbe skiri it eould not pass. His pecuIiarities caused bim to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fclt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presenoe capable of engaging their attenti0n. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the str0ng emolion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mariy of the femalo hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some rnorks of what lhey might term affectjon: LadyMercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since ber marriage, threw herself in his way, and did oll 6ut put on lhe dress of a mountebank, to attract his natice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when sbe stood before him, though his eyes were apparent1y fixed upon her's, still it seemed a\u017f if they were unporceived;\u2014even her unappaIled impudence was bclfsled, arid \u017fhe left the field. But though the common adultress could not influericc even the guidance of his oyes, it waf not that the femole sex was iridifforent to hiin: yet such was the apparent caulion wilh which he \u017fpoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himsolf to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it waf that it even overcame the dread of his singulclr character, or that they were inoved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domcstic virtues, as among those who sully it by lheir vices.\nAboul lhe same time, thcre came to London a young gentleman of tbe nclme of Aubrey: he wos an orphan lest with an only sister in the possession of great weallh, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they reljnquished the more importanl charge of his mind ta tbe care of rnercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, bence, that high romantie feeling of honour and oaridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He be1ieved all to sympathise with virlue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesquo effect of thc scerie, as we see in romances: he thought that tho misery of o cottage merely consisted iri the vesting of clothes, wbich were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye hy lheir irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in f ine, that the droams af poets were lhe realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rieb: for these reasons, upan his entering inta the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should d escribe with Ieast trulh their languishing or romp ing favourites: tho daugbters at the same lime, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his ljps, soon led bim into false notions of bis talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his soIilary hours, he was startledat finding, that, except in the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was na foundation jn real life for any of that congeries os pleasing picturcs and deseriptions oontained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, howeuer, some compensatian in his gratified vanity, he was about to rclinquish bis dreams, when the extraordiriary being we have above described, crossed him in hl\u017f career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of formlng an idea os the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observati0n af external objects, thari the tacit afsent to their existcrice, jmplied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imaginatiori to pictureevery thirig that flattered its propensity ta extravagant ideas, he soon forined this object into the hero of a romance, and determlned to observe the offfpring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted witb him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon bi\u017f notice, that his preseriee was always recagnised. He gradually Iearnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soari found, from the notes of preparation ln \u2014 Street, lhal he was about totravel. De\u017firous of gaining some information respecting this sirigular charaeter, who, till now, bad only wh ettod his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was timc for him to perform the tour, which for many generations hcls been thought necessary to enable tbe young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upori an equality with the aged, and notallowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scanda1ous iritrigues are mentioncd as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They c0nsented: and Aubrey immedialely mentioriing hi\u017f intentions lo Lord Rulhuen, was surprised ta receiue from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from hjm, who, apparently, hcld nothing jn common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opporlunily of studying Lord Ruthven'scharacter, and now he found, that, though many rnore of his actions were exposed tohis view, the resuIts osfered different conclusians from the apparent motjves t0 hjs conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and tho beggar, received srom his handmore than onough to relieve their jmmediate wants. But Aubrey could nol avoid remarklng, that it was not upon the virtuous, roduced to indigence by the misfortunes atteridant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were fent from lhc daor with hardly suppressed sneers; but wben the profligate came to ask something, not to relievo his wants, 6ut to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to \u017fink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent clway with rich charity. This was, however, otlributed by him to tbe greater lmportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over tbe retiring bashfulncsf of the virtuous indigent. There was orie circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still rnore impressed upon his mind: clll those upon wham il was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, far tbey wore all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the moft a6ject inisery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey waf surprized at the apparent cagerness with which his companion sovght for tho centres of all fashionoble vice; there heentered into all the spirit of the faro lable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known shclrper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but jt was always with the sarne unchanging face, with whicb he generally watchcd the sociely around: it was not, however, s0 wheri he encountcred the rash youthful novjce, or the luckless father os a nuinerous fclmily; thon his very wish seemed fortune'f law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind wa\u017f laid aslde, and his eycs sparkled with more fire than that of the cat wbilst daIlying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the f ormerly affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the soIitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him witbin the reach of tbis fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their presont craving. Yet he took no money from lhe gombling table; but imrnediately lost, to tbe ruiner of many, the lastgilder he had just snatched frorn the convulsjve grasp of the inriocent: lhis might but bc the result af acertain degree of knowledge, which wclf riot, however, capable as combating the cunnlng of lhe more oxperienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and bcg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend la his own profit;\u2014hut he delayed it\u2014for each doy he boped his friend would give hjm some opportunity of speakirig frankly and openly to bim; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in bis carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; ond though Aubrey was near the objoct of his curiosity, he obtalned no greater gratjfication from it than the c0nstant excitement of vainly wifhirig to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of fomothing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, aridAubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upori the morning eircle of an Itcllion countess, whilst he went in search of the memorjals af another almost doserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Englclnd, whjch he opened with eager impationce; tbe fi rst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; tbe others were from his guardiaris, tbe latter astanished him; if it had before entered inta bis imagination that there was an evil power resident in his compclnion, these seemed to give bim suffieient reason sor the belief. His guardians irisisted upon his immediately lcavlng his friend, arid urged, that his charactor was dreadfully viciouf, for that the possession of irresistib1e powerf of seduction, rendered his licenlious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that hif contempt for the adultre\u017fs had not originated in batred of her character; 6ut tbat he had required, to enbanoe hif gratifioation, that his victim, the partner of hls guilt, should be hurled from lhe pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sine, that all those semales whom he had \u017fought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since bis departure, throwri evcn the mask asidc, arid had not scrupled to exposo the whole doformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leauing one, whose eharacter hod n0t yet shown a slrigle brighl point on whioh to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plclusible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to walch him more closely, and to lel no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He cntered into the sarne circle, and soon perceived, thot his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose housc he ehiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimclrried female is met with in society; he was thereforo obliged ta carry on his p1ans in secrel; but Aubrey's eye followed him jn all his windings, and soon discovered that an af\u017fignation had been oppointed, which would mosl likely end in the ruin of cln innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intcntions with respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that he was aware of hif being ahoul to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he suppofed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avbrey retlred; and, immediately wriling a note, to say, that from that moment he must decljne accomponying hif Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordored bis fervant to seek other apartments, and calIing upon the inother of the lcldy, informed her os all he knew, not only with regard t0 her daughter, but a1so concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation wcls prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete afsenl to a separation; but did nol hint any suspieion of his plans having been foiled byAubrey's interpositiori.\nHaving lest Rome, Aubrcy directed his steps toward\u017f Greece, and crosslng the Peninsula, soon found himseIf at Athens. He then fixed hif residence in the house of a Greek; clnd foon oecupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancienl glory upon manuments that apparently, a\u017fhamed of chronicling the deeds of freemeri only besore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as bimself, existed a being, so beautlful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtrcly on canvass the promised hope of the failhful in Mahomet'\u017f paradisc, save lhat hor eyes spoke too much mind forany one to thjnk she could belong to lhose who had rio souls. As she danced upon the p1ain, or tripped alo ng the mountain's sidc,one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof her beouties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the clnimal suitcd 6ut to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acooinpanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconseious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whoIe beauty of hcr form, floating as it wcre upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, wbo forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almosl effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flittod around, exhibit in the \u017fun's ray sueh delicately briIliarit and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse lhe forgetsulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object ho had before thought of vital importance to lhe proper interpretalion of a passoge in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can apprcciate?\u2014It was inriocence, yauth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those romains of which he wished lo preserve a memorial for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencjl, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would lhen describe to him the circling dclnce vpon the open plain, would painl, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greatcr impression upon her mind, would tell him all the sup ernatural tales os her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent beliefaf what she narrated, excited lhe inlerest euen of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyro, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tief, forced every year, by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to prolong hjs existenco for the erisuing months, his blood would run coId, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idlc and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last dctected one living among lhemfelves, after several of their neclr relatives and childreri had been found marked with the starnp of the siend's appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to beljeve her, for jt had been, romarked, that those who hcld dared to question their exislence, always had same proof given, which ab1iged thom, with griefand heartbreakjng, lo confess it was true. Shc detailed to him the traditional appear-\nance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurale description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, thal there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in lhe supernatura1power os Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to atlach himself more and moro to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtves of the women among whom he had s0vght for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridicu1ed the idea of a young inanof English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more altached to the almosl fairy form before him. He would tear himself at timesfram her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wa\u017f attained; but he alwoys found jt impossible lo fjx his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mirid he retained cln image that seemod alone tbe rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscious os hls love, and was ever the same frank infanti1e being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was beoause she hod rio longer any one wilh whom she could visit her favourlte haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncoveririg some fragmorit wbich hod yet escclped thc destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subjcct os Vampyref, and they b0tb, with severaI present, affirmed their existence, pclle with borror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey dotermined to proceed upon one 0f his excursions, whieh was to detain him for a few h0urs; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, os he must necessarily pclss through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler thc dcly had closed, upon any consideration. They describod lt as the resort of thevampyres iri their nocturnal orgios, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representati0ns, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw tbem fhudder at his daring thus to mock a svperior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made tbeir blood freeze, he was silenl.\nNext mornlrig Aubrey set off upon his excurfion unattended; be was surprised to observe thomelancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, bad inspired them with sucb terrar. Wben he was about to depart, Ionthe carne to the side of hls horse, andearnestly begged os him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings lo be put in acti0n;\u2014hc promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that iri the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, clnd pour all thoir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014Hc at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by spced for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, ln these southern climates, is alm0st unknown; immediately the sun sels, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing lhunders had scclrcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foli ogc, whilst the blue forkcd lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his uery feet. Suddenly hi\u017f horse took fright, and he was carried wjlh dreadfvl rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fovnd, by the glareof lightning, that he was in the neighbovrhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted ilself up from tbe masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approclched, hoping to find some one to gvide him to the town, or at least trvsting to obtain shelter from the pelting os the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, all0wed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stjfled, exultant mockery of a laug h, continued in ane almost unbroken sound;\u2014ho was slartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rollod over his head, he, wilh a sudden efforl, forced open the door 0s the hut. He fovnd himself in vtter darkness: the sound, bowever, guided hjm. He was apparently unperceived; for, though hc ealled, stiIl the founds continued, and no notice wos taken af him. He f ound himself in contact wilb some one, whom he immediately seizcd; when a voice cried, \" Agclin bafflod!\" to which o loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by 0ne whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell bis life as dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was ln voin: he was lifted from his feet clnd hurled with enormous force againsl the graund:\u2014his enomy threw himself upon him, ond knecling vpon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the bole that gavc ljght in the day, dislurbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, clnd in a moment the crashing of the hranches, as he broke through the woad, was no longer beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapahle of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the ljght af theirtorches fell upon thc mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy f1akes of soal. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her crjes; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchef once more burst upon hjm, to perceive the airy form os his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hop ing that jt was but a vision arising fromhi\u017f disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he uncl0sed thcm, stretehed by his sjde. There was no colour upon her cheek, n0t even vpon her lip; yet tberc was a stillness obout her face that seemed almo st as attclcbing as tho life that orice dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and brcast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teoth hauing opened the vein:\u2014to this tbe men pointed, crylng, simultaneoufIy slruck with horror, \"AVampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who bad lotely been to him the object of so many hright and fairy vision\u017f, now fallen with thc flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thovght\u017f were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to sbun reflection, and lake refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular oonstructiori, which had been found in the hut. They were soon mct by difserent parties who had been engaged in the searoh ofher whom a mother had mlssed. Their lamentable cries, as they appr0achod the city, forewamed the parents of some dreodful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their gries would be impossible; bvt when thoy oscertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, arid point ed lo the corse. They were inc0nsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wilh a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these interva1s he would ca1l upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccounta6le coinbination he seemed to beg of his former companion to sparo the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upori his head, and cursc him as her destroyer. Lord R uthven, chanced at this time t0 arrivo al Athens, and, from whatover motive, upori hearing of the statc of Aubrey, immediately placed himse1f in the same house, and became bjs constont attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he wos horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image ho had now combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Rulhven, by his kind words, implying almofl repentance for lhe fault thal hadcaused their separation, and still more by the atte ntion, onxiety, and care whjch ho showed, foon reconciled himto his presence. His lordship seemed quito changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; butas faon as his convalescence began tobe rapid, he again grcldually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceivcd no difforence from the former man, except that at times be was svrpri\u017fed to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, wilh a smile of ma1icious exultation pIoying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the Iast stage of the invaIid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wclues raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, tbe moveless sun;\u2014indeed, be appeared t0 wish to avoid lhe oyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, wcls much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whieh had once so dislingujshod him now seemed to have fled f0r ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wishcd for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbaurhood of Athens; if he sovght it omidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iantho's form stood hy bis sjde\u2014lf he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the mod est vjolet; then suddenly turning raund, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smi1e upon her lips. Ho determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven,to whom he held himsclf bourid by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Grecce rieither hadyet seen. They trovelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb a reco1lection could beattached: bvt thougb they thu\u017f hasteried from place to place, yet they seeined not to heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robberf, but they gradually began t0 slight these reports, which they imagjned wero onIy the invention os individuals, whose interest it wcls to excite the generosity of those whom they defended froin preten ded dangers. In consequence of thus ncglecting thccldvico of the inhabitants, on one occosiori they traveIled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enteririg, however, a narrow defilo, at lhe bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their nogligence; for scarcely were the whole of the parly engaged in the narrow pass, when tbey were slartled hy the whjstling of bullets close to their heod\u017f, and by thoecboed report of several gunf. In an instant their guard\u017f had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in tbo direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of heing thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade thern advance, and belng expased to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take thom in the rear, they determined at once to rvshforward in seareh of the eriemy. Hardly had they l0ft the sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which braught him to the ground. Aubrey hastenod t0 bis assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces araund him\u2014hi\u017f guards havin g, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, immediately thrown up thoir arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Auhrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upori o ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014th ey being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with thc promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strengtb rapidly decreased; in two dclys mortlfication onsued, and death seemed advancing wjth hasly steps. His eonduct and appearance had not ehanged; he seemed as uneonscious of painas he had been os the objects about him: 6ul towards the close of the la\u017ft cvening, his mind became apparently unoafy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was indvced to offor his assistance with more lhan usual eamestness\u2014\"Assist ine! you may save me\u2014you may do more than thal\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death af my existence as little af that of the passing day; but you may save my hono-\nur, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? te1l me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I necd but 1ittle\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014bvt is yov would conceal all you know 0f me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shal1 not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your natvre fears, swear that, for o year and a day you will not impart your knowledgo of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you maysee. \"\u2014Hls eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAvbrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many ciroumstanees clttending his clcquaintance with this mori rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from lhe pre\u017fentiment of somelhing horrib1e awaiting him. Rjsing early iri lhe morning, he was about to onter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met hiin, and informed him that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself arid comrodes, upon bis retiring, to the pinnocle os a rieighbouring mount, according to a proinise they had given his lordship, that il should be exposed to the firsl cold ray of the m0on thclt rose after his death. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of the men, determincd lo go and bury it upon the spotwhere jt lay. But, when he had rnounted l0 the summit he f0und no troce of eitber the corpse or the clothe\u017f, lhough the robbers swore they pointcd 0ut the jdentical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in corijectures, bvt he at last retvrried, convinced that thoy had buried the oorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of o country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently corispired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had selzod upon his mind, he resoIved to leave il, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel lo convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing seueral weapons of offonce, more or less cldapted to ensure the death of tho victim. There were scveral daggers and ataghons. Whilst turning tbem over, ond examining lheir curious forins, whot was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weap on, ond his horror rnay be imagined wben he discovered thal it fitted, though pecu1iarly shaped, the sheath he heId in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no furlher certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to 6e bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; hul the particular form, the same varying tinls upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there werealso drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were cancerning lhe lady he had attemptod to \u017fnatch from Lord Ruthven's seductjve arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deparlure os his lordship. Aubrey's mirid became olmost broken under so inariy ropeated horrorf; he was afraid lhat tbis lady had sal1en a viclim lo the deftroyer of Ianthe. He becaine morase and filent; clnd hi\u017f only occupation cansisted in urging the speed of the postilions, af if hewere going to save the 1ife of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him ta the English shores; and he haslened to tbe mansion as hjs fathers, and ther o, for a mament, appeared to losc, in the embraces and cares\u017fes of his sister, all memory of the past. If sbe besore, by her infantine caresses, had goiried his offection, naw that the wornan began to appear, sbe was still more attachjng as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains lhe gaze and applaufe 0f the drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy whichonly exists in the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her b1ue eye was never Iit up by the levity of the mind bcrieath. There was a melancho1y charm abovt it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling wjthin, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her step wa\u017f not that light footing, which stroys where'er a butterfly or a coIour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alarie, her face waf never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her bis affection, and would in her presence forget lhofe gri efs she know destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged hcr smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if thofe eye\u017f,\u2014that faoe were then playing in the light of the ir own natiue sphere. She wa\u017f yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it hauing been thought by ber guardians more fit that her presentation sh ould be delayed until her brother's return from the conlinent, when he might be her pratector. It was now, lherefore, resolved thatthc nexl drawing-room, which was fast approachlng, should be the epoch of her enlry into the \"busy scene.\" Au hrcy would rather have remained in the inansjon of his fathers, and fed vpon tbe inelancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strclngers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had wjtnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own cornfort to the protectiori of his sister. They so0n arrived in town, and prepared for tho next day, which had been onnounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014cl drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxj0us to bask in tbe smile of royalty, hastened thithcr. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whlle he was standing jn a corner by himseIf, heedless of clll around him, engoged in the remembrance that the first tirne he had seen Lord Ruthvon was in that very plaoe\u2014he selt bimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in hls ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly oourage ta turn, fearful of \u017feeing cl speotre thclt would blclst him, when he perceivcd, at a liltle distanco, the same flgure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing lo bear their weight, be was obljged to take the arm of a friend, and forclng a passage throvgh the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and wa\u017f driven home. He paced thc room with hurried steps, and fixcd hisharids vpon his head,af if he were afraid his thoughts were burstlng frorn his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumftances started up in drecldful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He rousod himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the decld rise again!\u2014He thaught hisimagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It wcls irnpossible that it could be real\u2014he determined, theresore, to ga agoln into society; for though be allempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung up0n his lips, and he could not \u017fucceed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with hls sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection af a matran, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsclf up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, fovnd his sister surrounded hy several, apparentIy in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, tvrned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, feized his sifter's arm, and, with hurried \u017ftep, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himsels impeded by thecrowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that v oice whisper closc to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached horne.\nAubrey became alm0st distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now lhat the ccrtainty of lhe monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler's attentions were now vnheeded, and it was in vain that she intrealed him to explain to her wbat had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slartled him;\u2014was be then to allow this morister to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, arid not avert its progress? His very sister might haue becn touched by hiin. But even if he were to break his oath, and disolose his \u017fvspicions, who would believe him? He thaught of employirig his own hand to free the world from such o wrctch; but deoth, he remembered, had been already mocked. For day\u017f he remained in this state; shul up in his room, he saw noone, and ale only when his sister cclme, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support riature. At last, no longeroapable of bearing slillne\u017fs and solitudo, he left his house, roamed from street to street, clnxious to fly that image whlch haunted hiin. His dress became negleoted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day suri as to lhe midnight damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; atfirst he returned with theevening to the house; but at 1ast he laid him dowri to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His slster, anxiovs for his safety, employed people to f0llow him; but they were soon djstanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His oonduct, howeuer, sudderily changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his sricnds, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enler again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forcwarn, in spjte of hjs oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspiciouf looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obligcd to beg of him to abstain from sccking, for hcr sake, a soeiety which aff-\nected him so \u017ftrongIy. When, however, remonslrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper ta lriterpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, thoy thought it high time lo resume a gain thot trust which had been hefore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous 0f saving him from the injurie\u017f ond sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing t0 tho general eye those marks of what they considcred folly, they engaged a physicicln to refide in the house, and take constarit care of him. Ho hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed byone terrihIe subject. His incoherence became ot last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, ineapable of 6ejng roused. Hc had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affectjon and recollectlon remaining displayed itsclf upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks thot severe lyaffllcted her, ho would deslre her not to touch hirn. \"Ob, do not louch him\u2014if your love for me is clugbt, do not go riear bim!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, hi\u017f only answer was, \"True! lrue!\" and again he sank into a state, whenco not even she cauld rouse him. Thls lasted many months: gradually, howcver, as tho year was passing, his iricoherences bocame less frequent, and his mind thrcw aff a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians o6scrved, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of bis guardians entering his room, began to converse with his p hysioian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's bei ng in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Auhrey's altention was attracted; he asked anxiavsly to whom. Glod of this mark of returning intellect, of which thoy feared he had been deprived, tbey meritioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pIeased, and astonished tbem ftll1 more by hisexpressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring t0 see his sister. They anfwered nat, but in a few minule\u017f his sjster was with him. Hc was apparent ly agoin capable of being affected by the lnsluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed ber cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thaugbt of her brother's being ance more alive to the feelings of affeetion. He began lo speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratu1clte her upon her marriage with a person so distinguishcd for rank and every accomplishmcnt; when he suddenly pcrceived a l0cket upon her breasl; openjng il, what was bis surprise at boholding the features of the monster who had so lang influenced his life. He seized lhe portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled it vnder foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her futurc husband, be l0oked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantie expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would riever wed thif monstcr, for he\u2014 But be cauld not cldvance\u2014it scemed a\u017f is thot voioe again bade him remembor his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven was near him but sclw no ane. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who hod heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and for-\ncing him from Miss Aubrey, defired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he imp1ored, he hegged of tbem to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeav0ured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been resused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily undcrstood himself to bethe cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemod insclne, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the hou\u017fe of his former companion, ond, by constant attendanoe, and lhc prctence os great affection for the br other and interest in hi\u017f fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wha could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tollf to recount\u2014could speak af himself as of an individual having rio syinpathy with any bcing on the crowded earth, save with hor to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existenoe, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing aocents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use lhe serpenl's art, or such was lhe will of fate, that he gained her affectioris. The title of the elder branch falling at length to hjm, he obtained an irnportant ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening lhe mclrriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged statc,) which wos to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the phyfician and his guardians, attempted to brihc thc servants, but in vajn. Ho asked for pen and paper; it was glven him; he wrote a letter t0 his si\u017fter, conjuring her, as sbe valued her own happines\u017f, hcr own honour, and the honour of thosc now jn lhe grave, who once held her in lheir arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but f0r a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the mo\u017ft heclvy curses.The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, tho ravingf of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy irimates of the hause; and Aubrey heard, wilh a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the n0tes of 6usy preparation.Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servanls clt last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He \u017feized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment sound himself in the apartment where all werc nearly assemb1ed. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hirn: he immediately approacbed, and,taking his arm by force, hurri ed him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Rutbven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if n0t my 6ride to day, yovr sister is dishonoured. Womori are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendarits, who, r oused by the old woman, had come in \u017fearch of him. Aubrey could no longer support hlmself; his roge nat finding vent, had broken a blood-vefsel, and he wa\u017f conveyed to bed. This wos not mentioned to his \u017fister, wha wcls not present when he entered, as the physician was afrald of agitatirig her. The marriage wos so1emnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakncss increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approaoh of death. He desirod his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died iinmediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wben thoy arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvlhven had disappeared, andAubrey's \u017fister had glutted the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF L0RD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Theworld wos all bef0re him, where to cho0se hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, an board one of his Majesly's vessels, in the year 18I2, we pul into the har6our of Mitylenc, in tho island af that name. The beauly of this place, and the certairi supply of cattlo and vegetables alwayf to be had there, induce many British vessels to vlsit it\u2014bolh men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track f0r ships bound t0 Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tho deviation os a voyage. We landed; af usval, at lhebottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in w atering, and the purscr bargaining for cattle wlth the natives, the clergyman arid myself tooka ramble lo tho cave called Homer's School, and other place\u017f, where we had been befaro. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engageda young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come frain Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days provious to our arriva1 in his felucoa. \"He erigaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have token me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely lo get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The c0ttage over the hill, facing the river, bclongf to bim, and he has left an old man in charge 0f it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechiries sor it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constclntly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the different islarids.\"\nThis account excited our euriasity very much, andwe lost no time in hastening to lhe house where our covntryman had r esided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over themclnsion. It c0nsisted of four apartmentf on the ground-floor\u2014an entronce hall, a drowing-room, a \u017fitting parlaur, and a bed-room, with a spacious clo\u017fet annexed. They were allsimply decorated: pl ain groen-stained walls, marble tclbles on eitherside, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made ta play through the branchcs by rnovirig a spririg fixed ln the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed lhe furniture. In the hall stood half a doz eri English cane chairs, and an empty baok-case: there were no mirrors, nor a sing1e pointing. The bedchamber had morely a large mattress spread on tbe floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed o marble reeess, formerly, the 0ld man told us, filled with books and papers,whlch were then in a large soaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did riot thirik ourselves justified in examinirig the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Ro ufseau's works complete; Volney's Rvinsof Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of thc Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editiori, prinled at Parma in I810; severa1 small pamphlets fram the Grcek press at Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English book 0f any description. Most of theso books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe 0ld man said: \"The lord had been reading these books tbe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place thom with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unti1 his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withovt orders, he would frowri upon me for a week together; he is otherwoys very go0d. I once did him a fervice; and I have the prodvce os this farm for the troubIc of laking care of it, except twenty zecbines wbich I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small oo ttclge in the wood, and whom lhe lord brougbt here from Adrianople; I don't know for wbat reason.\"\nTbe appearance of tbe house exlernally was pleasing. The portico in front was fisty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marblc pillars with black pliriths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary iri Grocian architecture,) wcre considerably hlgher than the roof. The ro0f, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covercd 6y a sine Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of thc house-tops are thus furnishcd, as up0n them the Greeks pass thcir evenings in smoking, drinkirig light wines, such af \"lachryrna christ i,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet glided away, g rapes, 0ranges and limef were cluftering together on it\u017f borders, and under the shade of two large myrlle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamerita1 wooden back was placed, an which we were told, the lord passed mony af his evenings arid n ights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and taIking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was uery dcvovt, \"and always attended our ehurch twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"o bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to MovntCalcla, covered wjth oliue and myrtle tree\u017f in bloom, and ori the svmmit of which an ancient Greek templeappeared iri majestic decay. A small streomissuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woads near the mau-\nritain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates the vicw in front; and a little on the left, through a ujsto of 1ofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small iflands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wavo with spots os emerald groen. I seldom enjoyed a view morc than I did tbis; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his riame but Dominick, hjs banker, who had g0neto Ca ndia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, hut I am sure be will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, 6ut on our return lo the lown we learnt several particulars of theisolated lord. He had portioried eight young girls when hc was lasl upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptiol feasl. He gave a oow to one man, b orfe\u017f to others, and cotton and silk to the girls wha live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishermari wbo had lost bis own iri a gale, and he oftcn gave Greek Testaments to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have beeri a very eccentric and benevolcntcharacter. One circumstance we learnl, which our old friend at the cottage thaught proper not to disclose. He had a most bcautifvI daughter, with whorn the lord was often seen walkirig on the sea-shore, and he had bought hcr a piano-forte, and taught her himself the usc of it.\nSvch was the jnformation with whlch we departed from the peaceful is1e os Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guef\u017fing who this rambler in Greeoe could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanlhropy of disposition, arid all those eocentricitjes whjch mark p eculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were di spel1ed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architeet, a pupil of WYATT'S,who had been trovelling in Egypt andGreoce, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byran; I rnet bim in rny travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of hjs lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognlzed the recluse of Calc1a in euery page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at lhe cottag c, 6ut we consoled our\u017felves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future dcly; but to mo lhat day will rievcr return. I mclke this statement, believing it ri0t quite uninteresting, andin justice to his lordship's goad name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to ossociating with human nalure, ar contributing in ariy way to footh ils sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly tbe reverse, as may be plairily gathered from these little anecdoles. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegontly dep icted in his lordship's pooms, secm to have their seat in hjs bosom. Tenderriess, sympatby, and charity appear lo guide aIl his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a being on whose beart Religion hath set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence halh thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lrails\" without feeling proud of him a\u017f a countryman. With respect to his Ioves or pleasvros, I do not assume a right to giue an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed againsl man'smoral integrity; and he who dares justisy himself besore that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censurc the errors of a follow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of hisgenius. To do good in secret, and shun the wor1d's applause, js the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving canscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prlnter, Crown-caurt, Fleet-street.","18":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon which this tale is founded is very general in the Eclst. Among tbe Arabians it appears lobe common: it did not, however, exterid itself to the Grecks unti1 after the esta6lishinent of Cbristianity; and it has only assumed its present form fince the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if burjod in their territory, it graduaIly increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beavtifvl. In the West it spreod, with some slight variation, all over Hungory, Polarid, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the 6elief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibcd a cert-\naln portion of tbe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of eorisumplions; whilst these human blood-svckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to causo the blood to flow srom all the passages of thejr bodics, and evori from the very poref of lhcir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible aocount ofa particular oase of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It appcars, that upon an examination of the commander-in-ohief and rna gistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years besor e, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pavl, had beeri heord to say, that, at Ca\u017fsovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he hod been tormented by a vainpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the eorth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbjng himself withhis blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days clfter his death and 6urial, many persons cornplained of having been tormented by hirn, and a deposition was made, tbat four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisrn) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, thcy resorted to the aecuflomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which ho is reportod to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This d0ne, thoy cut off bis head, bvrned his body, and lhrow tbe ashes into his grave. The sclme measures were adopted with the corses of tbose persons who had previously died from vampyrism, 1est thoy should, in their turn, become agents upon olhers wha survived thcm.\nThe universal belief is, tbat a person suckod by a vampyre bccornes a vampyre hirnsclf, and sucks in his turn.\nChief baillff.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is here related, because il seems betler adapted to illustrate thc subjecl of the prosent observations than any other inftanee which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aster death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in exi\u017ftence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but coinpelled to confine his infernal visitations solely ta those beings he loved mosl while up0n earth\u2014th0se to wham he was bourid by ties of kindred and affoction.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earlh, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse fhaIl from it\u017f lomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midriighl draln the stream of Iife; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Tby victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; A\u017f cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withcred on the stem. But onc thot forthy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap tby heart in slame! Yot thou musl end thy task and mark Her cheok's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must vlew Which freezes o'er ils lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in ljfe o lock when shorn Affection's fondost pledge was worn\u2014 But riow is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood fhall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard 1ip; Then stalklng lo thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre mare accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced iri his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse 0f the Arabion maid Oneiza, who is rcpresented a\u017f having rcturried from the grave for the purpose of tormenling him she best loved whilst in existence. But thif cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her Iife, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity clnd innocence. Tbe veraciaus Toumefort gives a long occount in his travels os several astonishjng cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calrnet, in his great work upon thissubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradjtionary riarrativcs illustrative of its effects, hos put fortb some learned dissertations, tendlng to prave it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this sjnguIarly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for tbe limils of a note, riecessorily devoted lo explanation, and which may now be coneluded by mere1y remarking, that tbough the term Vampyre i\u017f the one in most gerieral acceptation, there are several others synonymous wjth it, mclde use of in variaus parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant vpon a Londori winter, thereappeared at the vclrious parljes of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sjngvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of thc fair only attrclcted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts wherc tboughtlessness rcjgncd. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explaln whence it arose: some attributod it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the 0bject's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through ta tho inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray tbat weighed upon the skin il could not pass. His pecu1jarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see hiin, and those who bad beeri clecustomed to vioIerit excitement, and riow fclt the weight of ennui, were pleased at hauing something in their presencecapable of engaging their attention. In spite af the de adly hue of his sace, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty,or from thestrong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beauljful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attompted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term afsection: Lady Mercer, who hcld been tho mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-raoms sirice her mclrriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but pvt on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she ftood before him, though hi\u017f eyes were opparently fixed upon her's, still it s eemed as if thoy were unperceived;\u2014evcn ber uriclppalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the comrnori adultress could not influence everi the guidance of his eyes, it was not tbat the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that fcw knew he euer addressed hjmself to feinales. He had, howeuer, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether il was that it even overcame the dread of bis flrigular c haracter, or that they were moved by his clpparent hatrod of vice, he was as often omong those females who form the boa\u017ft of their fex from theirdomestic virtues, as among thofe who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same tlme, thore came to London a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: he was an orph an left with an only sister in the possesfiori os great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more lmportant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary suba1ternf, he cultiuated more his imogiriation than his judgment. He had, hence, that high ramontic feeling of honour and candour, whioh daily ruins so many mjl1iners' appreritices. He bclieved all to sympathise with virtue, and thought lhat vice was thrown in by Providencc merely for lhe picturesque effecl os the scene, as we see in romancos: he thought that the misery 0s a cottage merely consisted in the ve sting of clothes, which were af warm, but which were better adaptod to the painter's eye by thejr irrogular folds ond various coloured patches. He tbought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the rea1ities of life. He was handsome, fronk, and rich: forthese reasons, upori his entering into the gay clrcles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describc with least truth their languishing or rompirig favourites: tho daugbters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whon he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talenls and hjs me rit. Attclched as he wos to the rornance of his folitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tcl1low and wax candles that flickered, not from the presencc of o ghost, but from want of snufflng, therc was no fovndation jn real life for any os that congerics of pleasing pictures and descriptions containod in thosc volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, same compcnsation in his gratisied vanjty, hc was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extra0rdjnarybeing we have abovo described,crossed him in hls cclreer.\nHe wcltched him; clrid the very impossibility 0f f0rming an idea of thc c haracler of a mon entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacjt assent to their existence, imp-\nlied by the ovoidance of their conlact: allowing his imaginotiori to picture overy lhirig that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formcd this objoct into the hero of a romance, and delermiried to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainled with him, paid him attentioris, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He graducllly learnt that Lord Ruthveri's asfairs were embarrclssed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about lo travel. Desirous of gajning some information respecting this singular chclracter, who, li1l now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, whicb far many generations has been thovght nccessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of prai\u017fe, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consentcd: and Aubrey immcdiateIy mcntioning his intentions to Lord Rvthven, was surprlsed to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such o mark os esteem srom him, who, apparently, had nolhing iri comrnon wjth other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had pasfed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's c harclcter, and n0w he found, that, th0ugh many more of his actians were exp0sed to his uiew, the results offered different concIusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compariion was prafuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, lhe vagabond, and the beggar, roceived from his hand rnore than enough to relicve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, thal he beslowed his alms;\u2014these were sent fram tbe door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask s0mething, not to reljeve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still decpcr in his iniquity, he wcls sent away wjth rich cbarity. This was, however, clltributed hy him to the greater importunity of the vic-\nious, which gonerally prevails over the retiring bashfuIness of the virtuous indigont. There was one clrcumstance about the charjly of his Lordship, which was ftlll more impressed uponhis mind: al1 those upon wh0m it was bestawed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffo1d, or sunk tothe lowest and the most abject misery. At Brufsels and other towns through which they passcd, Aubrey was surprized at the apparerit eagerness with whioh his compani0n sought sor tbe centres of a1l sashionable vice; there he entered inlo all the spirit of the faro table: be betted, and aIways garnbled with success, except where lhe known sharper was his antaganist, and lhen bc lost evcn more than he gclined; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with whlch he ge nerally watched the society arourid: il was not, however, so when he enc0untered the rash youthful novico, or the luckless father of anumerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this appclrent abftractedness os mind wcls laid aside, and hls eyes sparkled with more fire than thclt of the cat whilsl dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the sarmerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drown him withinthe roach of this fiend;whjl\u017ft mony a father sat fronlic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his lote immcnse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to scltisfy their present craving. Yet he took no rnoney from the gambIing table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of inany, lhe last gjlder he had just snatched from the convulfive grasp of the innocent: this mjght but be the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which was not, however, capahle as combating the cunning of the more experieneed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent this to his frlend, arid beg him to rosign that charity and p1easure which proved the ruin 0f all, and did nottend to his own proflt;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportvnity of speaking frankly and ope n1y to him; hawever, this never occurrod. Lord Ruth uen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes ofnature, was alwayf the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and lbaugh Aubrey was near the object of hisouriosity, he obtained no greclter gratisication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myslery, wbich to his exalted imagjnatiori began to assume the appearance of sarnething supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time 1ost sight of his companion; be lefl him in daily attendance uponthe mornirig circle of an Italiclri countess, whilst he went in search of the rnemorials of clnother almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lettors arrived from Englarid, which he opened with eager impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breclthingnothing but affection; the 0thers were from his guardians, the latter astanished him; if ithad before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power refident in his componion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately Ieaving bis friend, and urgcd, that his char acter was dreadfully vicious, for that lhe possession of irrosistjble p0wers of seduction, rendered his licentiouf habit\u017f more dangorou\u017f to sociely. It had been discoverod, lhat his contempt sor the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he hodrequired, to enhance his gratification, that hls victim, the partner af his gvilt, should be hurled from tbe pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to lhe lowost abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whoin he had sought, apparently on accovnt of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole dcformity 0f their vices to the publjc gaze.\nAvbrey determined upan leaving one, whose characterhad not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest tbe eye. He resolvcd to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning bim altogether, purposing, in the rnean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstonces pass by unnoticed. He eritered into the same circle, and soori perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperlence of the daughter of the 1ady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried fomale is met wjtb in society; he wcls therefore obliged to carry on his pIans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in oll his windings, and soon discovered thatan assignatiori had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an inriocent, th0ugh thougbtless girl. Lasing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and a6ruptly asked hiin his intentions witb respect to the lady, insorming hlm at the same time that he was aware of his being clbout to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were sveh as he supposed a1l would have upori such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he inte-\nnded to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wriling a nate, lo say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the rernainder os their proposed lour, he ordered his servant to seek otherapartmonts, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed hcr of all he knew, not only with rogard to her daughter, but also concerningthe character of his Lordshjp. The assignation wos prevenled. Lord Ruthven riext day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a sepclration; but did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Avbrey's interposition.\nHaving left Romc, Aubrey directed his steps lowards Greece, and cross-\nlng the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He theri sixcd his residence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon occupied hiinself in tracirig the fclded records of ancient glory up0n monuinents that apparently, ashamed os chronicling the deedf of freemen only before slaves, had bidden themselves 6eneath tbe sheltering soil or many co1oured licheri. Under lhe same roof as himself, existed a heing, so beautisvl and delicate, that she might have f0rmed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope os the f aithful in Mahomet's paradise,savo that her eyes spoke too much mlnd for any one ta think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon lhe plajn, or tripped along lhe mountain's side, one would have thoughl the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrey in his search afler antiquities, arid ofton would the unconscious glrl, engclged in the pursujt of a Kashrnere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of ber form, floating as it were upon the wind, lo tbe eager gaze of him, who forgat the lettcrs he had just decyphcred upon an almost effaced tclblet, in the contemplation af her sy1ph-likc figure. Often would her lresses falling, os she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swift1y sading hues, it might well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the veryobject hc had bef0re thought of vital importarice to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe eharms which all feol, but none can appreclate?\u2014It was innacence, youth, and beauty, unaffectcd by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. WhiIst he drew lh0se remains of whioh he wished to preserve a memorial for his fvture hovrs, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenos of hor native place; she would then describe to him the circling dclnce upon the open plain, would paint, to him in a11 the glowing colours of youtbful momory, the marriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, turning to subject\u017f that had evidently made a greater impressian upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural taIes of her nurse. Hcr eamestness and apparcnt belief of what she narrated, exclted the interest even of Au6rey; and often as she told him the tale of the ljuing vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friend\u017f, and doarest tief, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femcllo to prolong his exjslence for the ensuing month\u017f, his blood wouId run cold, whi1st he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe cited to him the na mes of old men, who had at lasl detected one living among lhemselves, after several of their near relativef and chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wben sbe found him so incredulous, she beggcd of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who hcld darod to question their existence, always had some proof giuen, which obliged thom, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to hirn the traditional appeorance of tbese monsters, orid his horror was increased, by hearirig a pretty occurate descripti0n of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth iri her fears, lhovgh at the same time he wonderod at the many coincidences which hcld all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural pawer of L0rd Ruthven.\nAubrey beg an to attacb himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocenoe, so contrasted with all the affeoled virtves of the women among whom he had saught sor his visjon of romance, won his heart; ond whiIe he ridicvled the idea of a young man of English hobits, inarrying ari uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself moro and inore attaehed to the almost fairy form besore him. He wouId tear himselfclt times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiqvarianrefearch, he would depart, deterinined not lo return vntil his object was attained; but he alwayf fovnd it impossible to fix bisatlentlon upon the ruins around him, whilft in his mind he retained an imclge thal seemed alone the rigbtful posscssor of his lhovght\u017f. Ianthe was unconsciov\u017f of his love, and wcls ever the sclme frank infantile being he had first kn0wn. She always feemed to parl from him with reluctance; but it wa\u017f because \u017fhe had no longer any one wlth whom she could visit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied ln sketching or uncovering some fragment whlch had yet efoaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo hor parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, asfirmcd their existence, pale with horror at thevery name. Soon after, Aubrey dotermined to procecd upon one of his excursions, which was lo detain him fora few hours; when lhey heardthe name of the place, tbey aIl clt once begged of him not lo return al night, as he must neccssarily pass through a wood, wbere no Grcek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideratjon. Tbey described it as the resort of the vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and donounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross thcir path. Aubrey rnade light of thejr reprcsentations, and tried to laugh them oul of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at bis daring thvs to mock a svperior, lnfernal power, the very name of whicb apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext mornirig Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended;he was surprised to observe the mclancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, bad inspired them witb such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side os his horse, and earriestly begged of him to return, ere night alIowed the power of thcse beings to be put ln aotian;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so 0ccupied in his research, that he did nat perceive that day-ligbt would soon end, and that in thc horizon there was ane of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapjdly gather jnto a tremendaus mass, and povr all their rage upon the devoted eountry.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for hi\u017f delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these soutbern cllmates, is almost unknown; jmmediately the sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he had advanced far, lhe power of the storm was abov o\u2014its ecboing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick hoavy rain forced its way thraugh the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he wos carried with dreadfvl rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, thal he was in the nejghbourbood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismovnting, he appr0ached, hoping to findsarne one to guide hirn to the town, or at least trusting to obtainshelter from the pelting of the starm. As he approached, the thunders, for cl mornent \u017filent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womcln mlrigling with the stifled, exultclnt moekery of a laugh, conlinued in orie almost unbrokcn sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whicb again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forcedopen the door of the hut. He found himself iri utter darkness: the sound, howover, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; f0r, though he caIled, still the sounds continued, and no nolice was taken of him. He found him\u017felf in eontact with somc 0ne, whom he immediately fcized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh sueceeded; and he folt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: detormined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it waf in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurIcd with onormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy lhrew himself upon him, and krieeling upon his breaft, had placed his hands vpon his throat\u2014when tbe glare of inany t0rehes penetrating throughthe hole that gavc lighl in tho doy, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly ro\u017fe, and, Ieaving his prey, rushed through thc door,and in a momerit the crashing of the branches, as be broke throvgb tbe wood, was no longer beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable af moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon lhe mud walls, and the thatch loaded on euery individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Avbrey they searched for her wha had attracted hjm by her cries; ho was agaln left in darkne\u017fs; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torcbe\u017f once mare burst upon him, to perceive the alry form of his fair conductress b rought in o lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hopjng that it was but a vision arising from his djsturbod imagination; but be again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by hi\u017f side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan ber lip; yet there was a stillness a6out her face that seemod almost as attaching as the life that orice dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and brea\u017ft was blood, and upori her throat were the marks 0f teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, slmultaneously struck wjth horror, \"A Vampyre! o Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the \u017fide of ber who had lately becn to him lhe object of so many bright and fairy visions, now follen witb the f1ower os life that had died w ithin her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benvmbed and seemed to shun rcflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he beld alinost unconsclously jn hjs hand a naked dagger of a particulclr construction, which had beeri found in the hut. They weresoon met by different parties who had been engaged in thc search of her wboma mothcr had rnisscd. Thcir lamentable cries, as they approclched tho elty, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be lrnpossible; but when they ascertained the oause of their child's death, they looked at Aubroy, and poinled to the corse. They were inconsolable; 6oth died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized witb a most violent fever, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he w0uld call upon Lord Ruthven and upori Ianthe\u2014by some vnaccountable combinati0n he seemed to beg of his former eompanian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate malcdictions upon his head, and ourfe him as her dostroyer. L0rd Ruthven, chanoed at tbis time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever inotiue, upori hearlng of the state 0f Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and bocame his oonslant attendont. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and ftartled clt the sight of him whose image he had riow comblned wjth that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hi\u017f kind words, iinplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their soparation, and still more by the atterition, anxiety, and caro which he showed, soori reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic heing who had so astonlshed Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradua1ly retired into thc same stateof mind, and Aubrey perceived no difserence from the foriner man, except that at tlmes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile os malicious exultation plclying upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smjle haunted him. Dvring the last stoge of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparontly engaged jn watchirig lhe tideless waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, 0r in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, llke ovr world, the moveless \u017fun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the cyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguifhed him now seerned t0 hove fled for ever. He was now as much a Iover af solitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; bvt mueh as he wlshed for solitude, his mind e0uld not find it in the nelghbourhood os Atbens; if he sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly srequenled, Iclntbe's formstood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her ljght step would clppear wanderjng amidstthe underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lheri suddenly tuming round, would show, to his wild imagination, her paIe face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lip\u017f. He determiried to fly scenes, evcry fealure of which created such bitter associations in his mjnd. He proposed to Lord Rvthve n, to whom he held himself bound by the tendcr care he had takon of him during his jllness, that thoy should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet feen. They travellod in every direction, and fought every spot to wbich a recollection couId be attached: but though they thus hastened from p1ace to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. Thcy heard much of robbers, but they gradvally bogan to slight these reports, whieh they imagined were orily the invention of individuals, whose intcrest il was to excile the gener0sity of those whom they defen-\nded from pretended dangers. In consequence 0f thus neglocting theadvice of lhe jnbabitarits, ori one occasionthey travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow dcfile, ot the bottom of which was the 6ed of a torrent, with large masses of rock hrought down from the neighbouring precipices, they hcld reclson to repenl their negligence; for scarcelywere the whoIe 0f the party engaged in lhe narrow pass, when they were startledhy tbo whistling of 6ullels close to their hoads, and by thc echoed report os several guris. In an instant tbeir guards had left them, and, placing them\u017felves bchind rocks, had begun to fire in tho direction whence tbe report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed 0s being thu\u017f detained by a foe, who with insulling shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in seorch of tbe eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a sbot in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistancc; and, no longer heeding the contest or his awn peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being woundcd, immediately thrawn up thcir arms and \u017furrendered.\nBy promises of great reword, Avbrey soon induced tbem to convey his wounded friend to a neighb0uring cabin; arid havirig agreed upon a ransom, he waf no more disturbed by their presenee\u2014they being content mereIy to guard the entrance till their eomrade should return with lbe promi\u017fed sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strengtb rapidIy decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death scemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appeclrance had not ehangod; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of lhe objects about him: hut towards the close of the last ev ening, his mind became opparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to 0ffer his assi\u017ftance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than tbat\u2014I mean not my life, I heed lhe death af my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any lhing,\" replied Avbrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014iny Iife ebbs apace\u2014I cannot cxplain the wh ole\u2014but if yov would coriceal al1 you know of me, my honovr were free fr0m stain in the world's mouth\u2014and lf my death were unknown for some time in Englarid\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but ljfe.\"\u2014\"It shall notbe known.\"\u2014\"Swcar!\" cried the dying man, raising himse lf with exultant violerice, \"Swear 6y all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for cl year clnd a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or deatb to any living being in any way, whateuer may happen, or whatever you mcly see. \"\u2014His eyef seemed burstlng from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing vpon his pillow, and breathed na more.\nAubrey retired to re\u017ft, but did riot sleep; the many circumstanc es attending his acquaintance witb this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold sbivering came over him, as if from the preseriliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he wos about lo enter the hovcl in wbicb he had left the corpse, wheri a robber inet hirn, and iriformed him that jt was no langer there, having been conueyed by himsclf arid comrcldes, upori his retiring, to the pinnclcle of a neighbouririg mount, accord-\ning to a promise they had gjven hls 1ordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking seueral of the men, determined to go and bury it upon thc spot where it lay. But, when he had mounled to thesummit he fourid no traco os either the corpse or the clothes, thaugh the ro6bors swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they had laid lhe hody. For a time bis mind was bewildered in conjeetu res, but he at last retumed, convinced that they had buried the oorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a eountry in which he hadmet with such terrible misfortunos, clnd in which aIl apparently conspired to hcight en that superstitlous melancholy that bad seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naples, he accupjed himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing scvera1 weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the uictim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst tvrning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at firiding a sheath apparently ornamented in thc same \u017ftyle as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to goin further proof, he found tbe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, th0ugh peculiarly shaped, tbe sheath he held in his hond. His oyes seemed to need no fvrther certainty\u2014they secmed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet ftill he wished to disbolieve; but the pclrticular form, the same varying lints upon thehaft arid sheath were alike in splend0ur on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eaoh.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his firsl inqulries were conccrning the lady he had attempted lo snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductlve arls. Her parents were in distress, thelr fortune ruined, ond she had not been h eard of since lhc departure of hif lordship. Aubrey's mirid becclme alm0st broken under so many repeated horrors; be was afraid that tbis lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose arid silent; and his only oecupation oonsisted in urglng the speed of thepostilions, as if he were going to savo the ljfe of soine one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which \u017feemed obedient to his will, soon waftcd him to the English shores; ond he hastened t0 the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momont, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of hjs sister, all memory of the past. If sbe before, by her infontine car esses, had gained his affection, now that the womcln began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winnjng grace whicb gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room afsemblie\u017f. There was noneof that light brilliancywhieh only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartinent. Her blue cye was never lit up by the lovity of the mirid boneath. There was a melanc-\nholy charm about itwhich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling wlthin, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not tbal light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her face was never brlghlened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would iri her presence fargel those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smilo f0r that of the voluptuclry? It scemed as if thoso eyes,\u2014thal sace were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had n0t been prcsented to the world, it having bcen thought 6y ber gvardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's relvrn from the eontinent, whon he mjghl bo her protector. It was now, theresore, resolved that the next drawjng-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of hcr eritry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon tho melanchoIy which overpowcred him. He could notfeel interest ab0ut the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind had been so tom by the events hc had witnessed; but he determined ta sacrifice his own comfort to the protection af his sister. They soon orrived in town, and prepared for the noxt day, which had been arinounced as a drawirig-room.\nThe crowd was excessivo\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long liine, and all wh0 were anxious to bafk in the smi le of royalty, bclstenedthither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whjle he was standingin a comer by himfelf, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembronce that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a volce he recognlzed too well, sovnded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had bardly courclge to turn, fearful of seelng a fpeetre that would blast him, when he perceived, al a little distance, the \u017farne figure which had attracted his notice on this spot vpon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs a1mostrefusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage throughthe crowd, ho threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, ond fixed his hands vpon his hcad, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bvrsting from his brain. Lord Ruthuen agaln befare him\u2014circumstances started up jn dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himsclf, he could riot believe it po\u017fsible-\n\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image hif mind was resting upon. It was impassible that it could be real\u2014he determined, therofore, to go again into society; sor thovgh he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could riot succeed in gaining insormalion. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a malrori, he retired irit0 a recess, and there gave himself up to his own de vauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many wero leaving, he roused himself, and entering clnother room, found hi\u017f sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he ottempled t0 pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the strect: clt the d0or he sound himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for tbeir lords; arid while hc was engaged in passing them, he agaln heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrylng his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became olmost distracted. Is before his mjnd had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now thal the certainty of tbe monsler's living agoin pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in uain that she intreated him to cxplain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starllod bim;\u2014wos he then to allow this morister to roclm, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not overl its progress? Hjs very sister mlght have been touched by him. But euen if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would 6elieve hlm? He thought of employing his awn hand to free lhe world fram such a wretch; but declth, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes streaming with tears, besougbl him, for her sake, to support nature.At last, no longer capable of bearing stillnoss and solitvde, he lest his house, roamed fr0in street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and hc wandered, os often exposed to the noon-daysun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized;at first he returnod with lhe evening to the house; but at last he laid him dawn to rest wherover faligue ouertook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but thoy were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. Hls conduct, however, suddenly changod. Struck with the idea thal be Ieftby his absencc the whole of his sricnds, with a fiend amongst them, os whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, clnd watch him cl0sely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hi\u017f oatb, all whom Lord Ruthveri approaehed with intimacy. But when he entered into a r0om, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sistcr wo\u017f al Iast obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for her soke, a fociety which affeoted him so \u017ftrongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guclrdians thoughl proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becomlng allenated, they thought it high time to re\u017fume again that trvft which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey'f parentf.\nDesirous of saving hiin from the irijuries and sufferlngs he had daily eneountered in his wanderings, and of preuonting him from exposing to the general eye those markf of what they eonsidered folly, they engclged a physician to reside in the house, and lake constclnt care of him. He bardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorhed by one lerrible subject. His incohercrice became ot last so great, that he was conflned to his cbam-\nber. There he would often lie for days, incapobIe of being roused. He bad become cmaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and rccollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimesstart, and, \u017feizing hcr hands, witb looks that severc1y afflicled her, he would desire her nol to touch him. \"0h, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is avght, do nat go near him!\" When, howover, she lnquired to whom he refcrred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and agajn he sank irito a state, whence not evcn sbe cou1d rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year wa\u017f passirig, his incoherencef became less frequent, and his mlnd threw off a portion of its gloom, whjlst his guardiaris observcd, that several timos in the day he would covnt upon his fingers a definite number, and then srnilo.\nThe time bad nearly elapsed, when, upon the last dcly of the year, onc of his guardian\u017f enlering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upori the melanoholy circvmstance os Aubrey's being in so awful a siluation, when his sister was golrig ncxt day to be married. Instantly Avbrey's atlention was attractod; he afked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark af returriing intellect, of wbich they seared he had bcen deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsdon. Thinking this was a y0vng Earl whom he had rnet with in society, Aubrey seomed pleas ed, and aftonished them still more by his expressing his intention lo be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered riot, but in a few minules his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the infIuence of her lovely smile; for he pressod her to his breasl, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at tbe thought of her brother'sbeing once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth,and to congralulate her upori her marriage with a person so di\u017ftinguished for rank and every accomplisbinent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening il, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his lifo. He seized the portrait in a paroxysin of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upori hor asking him why he thusdestroyed the resemblance of her futurc husbclnd, he looked as if he did nol understond her\u2014then seizing hor hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expressiori of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would never wedthis monfter, for he\u2014 But he could not advclnce\u2014it seemed as if that voice clgain bade hiin remember his oath\u2014he turned fuddenly round, thinking Lord Rulhven was near him bvt faw no one. In thc meantime the guardians ond physiciari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired hor to leave him. He fcll upon his knees to them, hc implored, he begged of them t0 delay but sor one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imaginod had taken possession af hif mind, ond eavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had call ed tbe inornjng after the drawjng-ra0m, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned lhat he was deemed insane, his exvltation arid pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Ho hastened to the house af his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and tbe pretence of great affection for the 6rother and interest lri his fate, hc gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers clnd tails ta recount\u2014cou1d speak of bimself as of an individual having no sympathy with any bolng ari the crowded earlh,save wjth her to whom he addressed bimsels;\u2014couId tell how, since he kriew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy 0f preseruation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing acconts;\u2014in fino, be knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falljng at length to him, he 0btained an iinportant embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's derangedstate,) which was to take plaoe the very day before his deporture for the continent.\nAubrcy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, atternpted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked sor pon and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own hclppiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o few hours that inarriage, on whicb he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought il better not to barass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pafsed on without rest to the busy inmates os lhe house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror lhat may more easily beconceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, arid the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosily of the servants at last overeame their vigilanco, they graduolly stole away, leaving him in the custody of ari helpless old woman. He sejzed the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himse1f in the opartinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the firsl to perceive hjm: he immodiately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When ori tho staircase,Lard Ruthven whispered jn bis ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to day, your sisler is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atlendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no 1onger support hiinself; hls rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he wasconveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his slsler, who was not present when hc entered, as the physician wa\u017f afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom 1eft London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effvsion of blood produced symploms of tbe neclr appraach of death. He desiredhis sisler's guardians might be called, and wheri tbe midnight hour had \u017ftruck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven bad disappoared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was oIl beforo him, where to choose his place af rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archjpelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the ycar 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pl acc, and the cortain supply of oattle and uegetables cllways to be had tbere, induce many British vessels to ui\u017fit it\u2014both men os war and merchantmeri; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountios oinply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; a\u017f usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst lhe men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and my\u017felf took a rambIe to the cave called Homer's School, and other pIacef, where we had been boforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small moriticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Groek os our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island fovr days previous to our arrival in bis felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did n0t choose to qvlt Mitylene, where I am like1y to gel married.He was on odd, bvt a verygood man. The cottclge over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, lbe wine-trader, six hvndred zechines for it, (a60vt L250 E nglish currency,) and has resided there about fourlcen months, though nat constantly; for he sails in his felucca very oftcn to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very mucb, and we lost n0 time in hastenlng to the house where our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over tbe mansiori. It consisted of four clpartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-ro0rn, a sitting parlour, clnd a 6ed-room, witha spacious closet annexed. They were allsimply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, mar6le tables on either side, a large myrt1e in the cenlre, and a small fountain beneath, which could bo made to play tbrough the brariches by movjng a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning postvre; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hal1 stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty 6ook-ca\u017fe: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedehamber had merely a large mattres\u017f spread on the fIoor, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pjllow\u2014tbe cornmon bed throvghout Greeco. In lbe sitting-roorn we observed a marbIe recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whicb were then ina large seaman's cbest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exclmirilng the contents. On the tablel of lhe recess lay Voltaire's,Shakspeare's, Boileou's, arid Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Ziminerman, in the German lariguage; Klopstock'f Mesfiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; se verol small pamphlets fr0m the Greek press at Constantinople, much lorn, but no English 6ook of any dcscriplion. Most of these books were filled with marginal n0tes, written with a pericil, in Italiari and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled al1 over, and marked with slips af paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"Tbe lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them wilh the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his retum; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orderf, he would frown upon me for a weok together; hc is otherways uery good. I once did hirn a servloe; and I hclve the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeohines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in cl frnall eottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThc clppearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces l0ng and fourteen broad, and the flutod marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it i\u017f now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surraunded by o light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkoy carpet, berieath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are thus surnished, as upon thom the Greoks pass their ovenings in smoking, drinklng light wines, such as \"lachryma christj,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the lest hand as we entcred the house, a small streamlet glided away, grape\u017f, aranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shclde of two large myrtlc bushes, a marble seat withan ornamental wooden back was placcd, on which we wore told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose,\" said the old mari, \"praying\" far he was very devout, \"and always attended ourchurch twico a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew from tbis seat was what may be tormed \"a bird's-eyc vjew.\" A 1irie of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CaIcla, covered wilh olive and myrtle trees in bloom, clnd on the summil of wbich an ariclent Groek temple appeored in majestic decay. A smallstream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until ll was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and cln horizon unshadowed 6y a singlo cloud, termiriates the view in front; and a ljttle on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnvt and palm-trees, several small islands were di\u017ftinctly obferved, studding the light blue wave with spots of emoraId green. I seldom enioyed a view more than I did lhis; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of tbe person who had resided in this romantic s0litude: nono know hls name bul Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" sajd our coriductor, \"oould tell, bul I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visil the Armonlan, but on our return to the town we learnt seve-\nral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was la\u017ft upon lhe island, and even danced with them at the nuplial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to olhers, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who had lost his own in a galc, and he often gave Greek Testamentf to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we col1ected, lo have been a very eccentric arid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old sriend at tbe cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most 6eauliful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on lhe sea-shore, and he had bought hor a piano-forte, and taught her hlmfelf the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peacefu1 isle of Mitylene; our imagination\u017f all on lhe rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, oll our doubts wcre dispelled. Falling in cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the arohitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been trclvelling iri Egypt and Greeco, \"The individual,\" faid he, \"a6out whoin you are s0 anxious, js Lord Byron; I mot him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also vjsited him al Mitylene.\" We had n ever then heard of his lordship'f fame, as we had beeri somc ycars srom home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pul into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curjous in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with lhe idea of returnirig to Mitylenc ori some sutvre day; but to me that day will never return. I make this sta-\ntement, believjng it nol quite unintcresting, and in justice to his Iordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling dlsposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributirig in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add loits pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All tbe finer feelings of the beart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo havc thcir seat in hif bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charily appoor to guide all his actions: and his courting the reposc 0f solitude is on additional reasori for marking bim as a beingon whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whofe head Bonevolence hath tbrown her rnantle. No man canroad the preceding p1easirig \"traits\" wjthout feeling proud of bim as a countrymcln. With respect to his loves or plea\u017fures, I do not assume a right t0 give an opinjon. Reports are ever to he r eceiued wilh caution, particularly when directed against man's moral iritegrity; and he who dares jvstisy himself before that owful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fel1ow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in sccret, and sbun the world's applause, is tbe surest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving c0nscience.\nTHE END\nGjllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","19":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wjlliam Po1idori\nTHE suporslition upon which this tale is founded is vory general in the East. Am0ng the Arabians it appears lo be commori: it did not, however, extend itsclf lo the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed jts prefent form since the diuision of the Latin and Greek churches; at whicb time, the ideo becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually incrcased, and formed tbe subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon theblood os lhe yaung and beautiful. In lhe West it spread, with \u017fome slight variatiori, all over Hungary, Po1and, Austria, and L0rraine, where thc belief cxisted, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portlon of the blood of thoir uictims, who becclme emaciated, I0\u017ft their \u017ftrenglh, and speedily died of consumptlons; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their vejns becamedistendcd to sucb a stclte of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of the ir skins.\nIn tbe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible acc0urit of a particuIar case of vampyrism, which is statcd to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appear\u017f, that upon an examinatlon of the commonder-in-chief and magistrates of the place, tbey positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a cortairi Hcyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hoard to say, that, at Cass0via, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating sorne of the earth out of tho vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with hls blood. Thisprecaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming avampyre himfelf; for, about twenty or thirly days after his death and hurial, many persons complained of having beentormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprjved os life by his attacks. To preuerit furlher mischief, tho inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usucll in cases 0f varnpyrisrn) frosh, and entirely free from corruption, arid emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid bl0od. Proof having been thus obtained, they rosorted lo the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreodfully as if he had been cllive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, andthrew the ashes into hif grave. The same measures were adopted with the corsesaf those persons who had previously died frorn vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, beoome agents upon olhers who surviued them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vclmpyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tvrn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monslrous rodomoritade i\u017f here related, because it seems 6ettcr adapted to illustrate lhe fubjoct of the present obseruations than any other jnstance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is consjdered as a sort of punjshment aftor death, sor some heinous crime commitled whilst in existence, that the deceased is not on1y do0med to vampyrise, but compelled to confine bls irifernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he wos bovnd by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A suppositiori alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nButfirst on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the bl0od os all thy rclce; There from thy daughtcr, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loathe lhe banquet which perforce Must foed thy livjd living corse, Thy victims, ere tbey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their si re; As cur\u017fing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withored on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best bel0ved of all, Shall ble\u017fs thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart jn f lame! Yel thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's lclst tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And lhe last glassy glclnce must view Whlch sreezes o'er its lifeless blue; Theri with unhallowed hand shall toar The tres\u017fes of her yellow hclir, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne awoy by lhee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood sha1l drip; Thy gnashing looth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy svllen grave, Go\u2014and with Gaulf and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed thcln they.\nMr. S0uthey hcls also introduced in bis wild but beautiful poein of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, wbo is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she 6est loved whilst in existonce. But this caririot bo supposod to have resulted from the sinfulne\u017fs of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale a\u017f a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourncfort gives a long occount in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends lo have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work upon this subject, besidos a variety of anecdotes, ond traditionary narrativefillustrative of itseffects, has put forth somc learned dissertatioris, tending to prove it to be a classi cal, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious arid iriteresting notices on this singuIarly horrible superstition might be added; though the present rnay suffice for the Iimit\u017f of a note, riecessarily devoted to explonation, and which may now be con cluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre if the one in most goneral acceptation, there aro several others syrionymous wjth it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, VardouIocha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT bappened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of thoton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upan the mirlh around him, as if be could not participate therejn. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upan the o6ject's face, did not seem to penctrote, and clt one glance to pierce through to the inward workingsof the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. Hif pcculiaritics caused him to be invlted to every house; all wisbed to see him, and those wha had been accustoined to vioIent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennul, werc pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their atlention. In spile of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained o warrner tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passion, lhough its form and outl ine were beautiful, many of lhe female hunters aflor notoriety altempted to win his ottentions, and gain, at least, some marks of whot lhey migbt term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been thomackery of every morister shewn iri drawing-rooms since her mar riclge, threw hcrself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to ottract his notice:\u2014though in vajn:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as is they were unperceived;\u2014cven her unappalled impudence wos baffled, and she left the field. But though the comman adultress c0uld not influence evon the guldance of his eyes, it was not lhat the female sex was indifferent to him: yel such was the apparent cavtjon with wbich he spoke to the virtvous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew be ever addressed hlmsels to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether jt was that it even overcame the dread af hi\u017f sjngular character, or that they were moved by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females wbo form tho boast of thelr scx from their domestio vlrtues, as among those who svlly it by their vicos.\nAbout thesame time, there came to Londori a young gentleman of the name 0f Aubrey: he was an orphan lest with an only slster in the possession of great weal-\nth, by parents wb0 died while be was yet in childhood. Lest also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir dvty merely to lake care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit chargo of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cvltivated more his imaginotion than his judgment. He had, hence, that hjgb romantic feeling of honour and candour, whlch daily ruinf so many rnllliners' apprentices. He believod all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was lhrown ln by Providorice merely for the picturesque effeot af the scene, as we seein romances: he thought thal the misery 0f a cottage merely consisted in the vesting ofclothes, whieh were as warm,but which were better adapted to thc painlcr's eye by their irregular folds and various c0lovred patches. He thought, in fine, thatthe dreams of p0ets were the realities of life. He was bclndsome, frank, and rich: for tbesercasons, upon his entering inta the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should descrihe with 1easl truth their languishing or romping favouritef: the daughters at the \u017fame time, by their brighlening cauntenances whenhe approached, and 6y their spclrkling eyes, when hc opcned his lips, soon ledhirn into false notions os hif talentf and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his s0litary hours, he was start1ed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax caridles that flickered, nat from the presence os a ghost, bul from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleaslrig pictures and descriptions contained inthose volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreoms, when tho extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched bim; and the very impossibilily of forming ari idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hlmself, who gaue fcw other signs of his obscrvationaf extemalobjects, than the tacit assentto their existence, implied by the avoidance of lhejr conlact: allowing his linclgination to picture every thing that flclttered its propensity lo extrovagant ideas, he soan formed this objeot irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, ratber than the person before hiin. He became acqvclinted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that bis presence was aIways reeognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrasfed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was aboul to travol. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had onIy whetted hls curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for bim to perform the t0ur, whlch for many gerierations has been thoughl neoessary to enable the young to take \u017fome rapid steps in the career of vioe towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not a1lowing thom to appear as if fa1len from the skies, wheneuer s candalous intrigues arc mentioned af the subjocts 0f pleasantry or of praisc, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately meritioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprifed to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fl atterod by sueh a mark of csteem from him, wbo, apparently, bad nothing in common with other meri, he gladly accepted it, and in a few doys they had passed the circling waters.\nHltherto, Aubrey had had no opporturiity of ftvdying Lord Ruthv-\nen's character, and now he fovnd, that, tbough many more of his aotions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conc1usjons frorn the apparenl molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, tbo vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than eriough to relieve their immediato wants. But Aubrey covld not avoid remorking, that it was not upon tbe virtuous, reduced t0 indigenco by the misfortuncs attendont even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were scnt from the door with hardly suppressod sneers; bul when the profligate came to ask something, nol torelieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in hif lust, or to sink him slill deeper in his iriiquity, ho was sent away wilh rich charity. This wa\u017f, howevor, attributed by him to the greclter importunjty of the vicious, which genera1ly prevails ouer the retiririg bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstonce about the charity af his Lordship, which was still more impressed upan his mind: all lhase upon whom it was be\u017ftowed, lnevitabIy found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all ejther led to thc scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the mosl abject misery. At Brussels and other townsthrough which they passed, Aubrey wos surprized at the apparent eagernesf with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all tbe spirit of the faro table: he betted, arid always gainbled with success, except where the known sharper wcls his antagonist, and thenhe lost euen more than he gained; but il was cllways with tbe sarne unchariging faco, with which he generally watched the sooiety arovnd: it was not, however, so when he encounlcred the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fatber of a numeraus family; then hif very wish seemedfortvne's law\u2014this appclrent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his cyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat w hilst dclllying with the half-dead mouse. In overy town, he left the formerly affluent youth, tom from the oircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude af a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him withln the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhout a single farthirig of his late immcnse weaIth, wherewith to buy even susficient to sati sfy their present craving. Yet he took no m0ney from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder bo had jvst snatcbed from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result ofa certain degree of knowledge, whioh waf riot, however, capable of combating the cunning of the rnore ex perienced. Aubrey often wished lo represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his 0wn profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hopod his sricnd would gjve him some opportunity of speclking frclnkIy and oponly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst thc various wild and rich scenes os nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was ncar lhe object of his curiosity, be obtairied no grealer gratification from it than the constant excitemenl of vain1y wisbing to break that inystery, which to bis exalled imagination began to assume the appearance of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sigbt of his companion; he left bim in daily attendclnce upon the morning circlc of an Italian countesf, whilst he went in search of tho memorials of another olmost deserted city. Whilst he was thvs engaged, letters arrived froin England, which he 0pened with eager impatience; the first was fram his fister, brealhing nothing but affection; thc others were from his guordians, the latter astonished him; if it had before eritered into his imaginatiori that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to giue him sufficient roason f0r the belief. His guardians insifted upon his jmmediately leaving his friend, and urged,that his chclraoter was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduetion, rend ered hif licenlious habits more dangerous to soclety. Il had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he bad required, to cnhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt,should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vlrtue, down to lhe lowost abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on occount of thoir vlrtue, had, sjnce his departure, thrown evon the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposo the whole deformity of lheir vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on whi ch to rest lhe eye. He resolued to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hiin altogether, purpasing, inthe mean while, t0 watchhim more closoly, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered intothe same circle, and soon perceived, thal bis Lordship was endeavouring to work upon tho inexperience of the daughtor of tbe lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on hi\u017f plans in secret; but Aubrcy's eye followed him in clll his windings, and soon disoovered that an assignation had been appoinlod, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, tbough thoughtless girl. Losing no tim e, he entered the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly askod him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time thot he was aware of his being ahout to meel her that very nighl. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions werc such as he suppo-\nsed a1l would hclve upon such an oocasiori; and upon beirig prefsed wbether he intended to rnarry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, tbat from that moment he must dec1ine accompanying his Lordship in the remoinder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant toseek other apclr tments, and calli ng upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning lhe character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven riexl day merely sent his seruant to notify hls complele assent loa separation; bul did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foilod by Aubrey's jnterp0sltion.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directod hif steps towards Greece, and crossing the Penjnsu1a, soon found bimself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in tbe hovse of a Greek; and soori occupjed himself ln tracing the faded reeords os ancierit glory upon moriuments that apparently, asharned of chr onicling the deeds of freemon only before slaves, had hidden thernselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, \u017fo becluliful and delicate, that she mlght hclve formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canva\u017fs the promised hope os tbefaithful in Mahomet'\u017f paradise, save that her eyes spake too much mjnd for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountclin's side, one would bave thought the gazel1e a p0or type of her beautios; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye os animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious Iook of the animal svited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light \u017ftep of Ianthe often accompani ed Aubrey ln his search after antiquities, and often wauld the unconscious girl, engagod in the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty os her form, floating as it were upon tho wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letter\u017f he had iust decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the c0ntemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she fljtted araund, exhibit in the sun's ray svch deljcately bril1iant and swiftly fading h ues, it might well excuse the forgetfvlness of the antiquary, who 1et escape from his mind the very objcct he had hefore thought of vital importance ta the proper lnterpretation of a passage in Pausanjas. But why attempt to describe charms which all seel, but none can appreciatc?\u2014It was inn0cence, youlh, and beavty, vnaffected by crowded drawing-rooms aridstifIing balls. Whilst he drew tho se remajns of which he wished to presorve a memorjal for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch tho magic effecls of his pencjl, in tracing the socnes of her native place; she would then de\u017fcribe to him the circlirig dance upon the open plain, wou1d paint, to him in all the glowing colours af youthful inemory, the rnarriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infoncy; and then, turning to subjects that bad evidently mado a grea ter impressjon upon her mind, would tell hiin all the supernatural tales af her nurse. Hcr earnestness and apparenl beljef of what she narrated, exoited the interest even of Aubrey; and often af she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had pclssed years amidsl his friends, and dcarost ties, forced every year, by foeding upon the life of a lavely female to prolong his existenoe for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whil sl he attempted to lough her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ionthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at laft delected one living amorig themselves, after several of t heirnear relatives and children had been found marked with the \u017ftamp of the fiond's appe tite; and when she found him so iricredulovs, she begged of him to believe her, for il had been, remarked, tbatthose who had darcd to question thoir exjstence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to eonfess it was true. She detailed to him tho traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descriptlon os Lord Ruthven; he, however, still pcrsisted in persuading her, that lhere could be no truth in ber fears, though at the \u017fame timehe wondered at tbe many coinoidences whjch hadall tended to exoile o belief iri the svpematural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAu6rey began to attach hirnself rnore and more to Ianthe; her jnnoeence, so cont rasled with all the asfected virtues of the women omong whom he had soughl for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man os English habits, marrying an unedvcated Grcek girl, still he found bimself more and more attached to tbe almost fairy form before him. He would lear himself at times from her, and, sorming a plari for somo antiquarian research, he would depart, determined riot to return until his o6ject was attained;but ho always found it impossible to fix his attontion upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image tbal fcemed alone tbe rightful possessor os his th0ughts. Ianthe was uncanscious of his love, and waf ever tbe same frank infanlile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was hecause she had no 1onger clny one with whom she could vifit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelching or uncovering some frogment whioh had yel efcaped the deftrvctive hclnd of time. She had appealed to her parents ori the suhject of Vampyros, and they both, with severaI present, affirmed their oxislonce, paIe with horror at the very name. Saon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon ono of his excursions, which was to detainhim for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, thoy all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through o wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considerati-\non. They described it as the resart 0f the vampyres in thcjr nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evi1s as impcnding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made ligbt of their representcltions, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal p0wer, lhe very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his cxcvrsion unattended; he was surprised to obscrve the meloncholy face ofhjs host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. Whon he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retum, ere nlght allowed the power of these beings to be put inactjon;\u2014he promised. He was, howcver, so occupiod in his research, that he dld not perceive that day-light would s0on end, and tbat iri tho horizon there was one af those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a trcmendous ma\u017fs, and pour all their rage upori the devoted country.\u2014He at 1ast, howevcr, mountcd his horse, determined to make up 6y speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climalef, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sels, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, thc power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain f0rcedits way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked llghtning seemed to sall and radiale at his very feet. Suddenly hls horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rclpidity through tbe entangled forest. The animal at laft, through fcltigue, stopped, and he found, by the glclre of lightning, that he was in theneighbourhood of a havel that hardly liftod itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded il. Dlsmounting, he approached, boping to find some one to gujde him to the town, or at least trusting to obtclin shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the droadfuI shrioks of a woinan mlngling with the stjfled, exultant mockery of a laugb, continued in one almo\u017ft un6roken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused 6y the thunder which again ralIed over hi\u017f head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparentlyunperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice wa\u017f taken of hjm. He found himself in coritact with some one, wbam he immediate1y seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\"to whicha loud laugh fucceeded; clnd he felt hjmself grappled by one whose strength seemod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against tbe ground:\u2014his onemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his harids upori his throat\u2014when tbe glare of rnany torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbcd him;\u2014he in\u017ftanl1y rose, and, leaving his prey, rvsbed through the door, and in a moment thc crashing of the branches, as he broko through the wood,was no longer beard. The storm was riow still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torohes fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who bad attraoted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was hjs h orror, when the light of the l0rches once more bvrst upori him, to porccive the cliry form of hi\u017f fair conductress brought in a lifcless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arifjng from his disturbed imagination; bvt he again saw the same form, when he unclosod them, stretched by his side. There was no c0lour vpon ber cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness abovt her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt thcre:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, arid upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men polnted, erying, simullarieously struck with horror, \"A V ampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf laid by the sido of her wha hod lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen withthe flower of life that had died wilhin her. He kriew not what his thoughls were\u2014his mind was beriumbed and seemed to shvn reslection, and lako refuge in vacclncy\u2014he held alrnost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hvt. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in tbe search of her whom a rnother had missed. TheirIamentable cries, as lhey approached the city, forowarned the parenls of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their gricf would be impossible; but when they ascertclined the causo of their child's death, they l0oked at Aubrey, and p0inted lo thc corse. They were lnconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was sei2ed with a most violent fever,arid was often deliriou\u017f; in these iritervals hc would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianlhe\u2014by some unoccountable oombination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other limes he would imprecclte maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chclnced at this tjme to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever motive, upon hcaring of the state of Aubrey, immediate1y placed himself in the same house, and became his constant atteridont. Whcn the lcltter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starllcd ot the sight of him whose image he had now c0mbined with thot of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, irnplying almost repentance for the fauIt that had caused lheir separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his pre\u017fence. His Iordship seemed quite ch anged; he no longer appeared tbat apathetic being who had so a\u017ftonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conualescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey porceivcd no djfforence from tho former man, exeept that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intcntly upon him, with a smile of ma1iciovs exultation playing vpon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng lhe last stage of the lnvalid's recovery, Lord Rvthven wcls apparently engaged jn watchlng the tideless waves raised by the cooling breoze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movole\u017fs sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened,and that elasticity of spirit which had onee so distinguished him now seemedto hclve fled sor ever. He was now as much o lover ofsolitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul much as he w ishodfor solitude, his mind could n0l find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the rvins he hod formerly frequenled, Ianthe's form stood by bis side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in que\u017ft of the modest vioIet; then suddcnly turriing round, would show, to his wild irnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feoture of which created fuch bitter associations ln bi\u017f mind. Ho propo\u017fed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tendor care be had taken of him during bis illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neitber had yet seen. They travelled in every direction,and sought every spot to which a recoIlection e0uld be clttached: but thovgh they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed wbat they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, hut they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they imagined were only the invontion of indiv idualf, whose interest it was to excite tho generosily of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequencc of thus neglecting lhe advlce 0f the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled witb orily a few guardf, more to serve as gu idos than as a defence. Uporientering, howev er, cl narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brovght dowri from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent lheir riegligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in lhe narrow pass, wbon thoy were startled by tbe whistling of bullets clo\u017fe to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guris. In an instant thelr guards had lest them, and, placing thcmselves behind rocks, had begun to sire in the directjori whence the report came. Lord Rulhven and Aubrcy, imitatirig their example, retired for a m0ment bchind the sheltoririg turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus d etained by a foe, wha with insulting shouts bade them cldvance, and being exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers sh0uld cli mb ab0ve ond lake them iri the rear, they determiriod at once to rush forward in search of the enerny. Hardly had they lost the sbelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received o shot in the shoulder, which brought bim to thc grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer beeding the conte\u017ft or his own peril, was soon surprised hy seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven'\u017f being wounded, immediate1y thrown up their arms and svrrenderod.\nBy promises of great rewclrd, Aubrey soon induced them to canvey his wounded fricnd to a neighbouring cabin; and havirig agreed upon a ransom, he wos no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content mcrely to guard the entrance till thojr comrade should return with the promised sum, far which he had an arder. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificalion ensued, and death seemed cldvancing with basty slops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uneonsciouf os pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induccd to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestnefs\u2014\"Assistme! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed thedcath 0f my existence as little as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your fricnd's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"Ineed bul little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if y0v would conceal all you know of mo, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014orid if my death were unknown for some tirne in Englarid\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall n0t be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying mari, rai\u017fing himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day y0u will not impart your knowlcdge of my criines or death to any living bejng ln any way, whatevermay happen, or whatevcr you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" sajd Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pi1low, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired lo rest, but did not sleep; the mclny circumslances attending his aoquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, arid he knew nat why; when he roinembered his oath a cold shivering came over bim, as if from the presentiment of something horri6le awaiting him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when o robber met hiin, and informed him that it was no long er there, baving becn conveyed by himsels and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed ta tho first cold ray af the moon that rase after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bvt, whcri he had mounted to tbe summit ho found no trace of either the c0rpse or the clothes, though lhe robbers swore they p0inted out the identieal rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lasl returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met wilh such terrlble misfortunes, and in which all apparently eonspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon orrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessol to convey him to Otranto,or to NapIes, he oecupied himself in arranging those effeots he had wjth him belonging to Lord Ruthveri. Amongst other things there was a ca\u017fe containing several weapons of offcnce, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilsl turning them over, and examiriing their curious forms, what was hif surprise at finding o sheath apporenlly ornamented in lhe same style as the dagger discovered in tbe fatal hut\u2014he shvddered\u2014hastening lo gain furtber proof, he found the weapori, ond his horror may be imaginod when he discoverod that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seerned to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to thc dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the fame varying tirits upon the hast andsheath were alike in splendovr on both, and Ieft no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hjs wayhome, clt Rome, hjs first inquiries were concernlng the lady hc bad attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivc arts. Her parenls were iri di\u017ftress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of s ince the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid tbat this 1cldy had falleri a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. Hc became morose and silenl; and his only occupation cansisted iri urging the speed af thepastilions, as if he were going to \u017fave the life of somo one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; cl breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, \u017foon wafted him to the English shares; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers,and there, for a moment, appeared to lofe, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of lho past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more allaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning gracc which gains the gaze ond applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of tbclt light brilliancy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a orowded apartment. Her blue eyc was neverlit up by the levity of the rnind beneoth. There was a melancholy charm abovt it which did not seem to arise from misf0rturie, but from some seeling within, that appeared to indicate a souI conscious of a brightor realm. Hor step was not tbat light footing, which strays where'er a butlerfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedclte and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smlle of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would ln her presencc forget th0se griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who wauld havc exchariged her smile for that of thc voluptvary? It seemed af if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native spbere. She was yet on1y eighteen, and had not been presenled to the world, it having been thought by her guardiaris more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return frorn the continent, when be might be her proleclor. It was now, therefore, resolved lhat tbe nexl drawjng-room, which was fast opproaching, should be the epoch of her enlry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel iriterest about the frivo1ities os fashionable strangers, when hjs mind had bcen so torn by the euents be had wilnes sed; but be determiried to sacrifice bis own comfort to the protection of hjs sisler. They foon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arinounced cls a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessiue\u2014a drawirig-raom had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While be wasstanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance thal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddonly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear\u2014\"Remem6er your oath.\" He had hardIy covrage to tvrn, fearfvl of seeing a spectre that would bIast him, when he pereeived, at a little distance, the samc figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed til1 hls limbf almost refusirig to bear their weight, he was obliged to take thc orm of a friend, and foreirig a passage through the crowd, be threw hjmself into hls carriage, and was driven home. He paced lhe raom with hurried stops, and sixed his harids upari his head, as if he were asraid his thougbts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances \u017ftarted up in dreadfuI array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He r0vsed himself, he could not beIieve it possible\u2014the dead rise agajn!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind waf resting upon. It was imposslble that it cauld be reol\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask coricerning L0rd Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, ond he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his fister to the clssembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a rece\u017fs, and there gaue himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, thal many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrourided by several, apparently in earnest conversation; hc attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him tbose fealures he mosl abhorred. He sprangforward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forccd her tawards the street: at the do0r he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who wore waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged iri passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to hiin\u2014\"Remember yaur oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey bocame almost distracled. If before his mind had been absorbod by one svbject, how much more compIctely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of lhe morister's liuing a gain pressed upon hjs lhoughls. His sister's attentions were now unheedod, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and th0se terrified her. The inore he thought, lhe more he was be wiIdered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he thon to allow this monsterlo roam, 6earing ruin upon his breoth, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. Bvt even lf he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand t0 frec the world froin such a wretch; but doalh, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this stalo; shut up in bis room, he saw no one, and clte only whcn his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughthim, for her sake, to support nature. At last, rio longer capable of bearjng ftillness and solitude, ho loft his house, roamed from slreet to street, anxious to fly thatimage which haunted bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnjght damps. He was no longer lo berecognlzed; at first he returned with the everiingto tbo h0use; but at last he laid him down ta reft wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for hif safety, emplayed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, howover, suddenly changed. Struck with the ldea that be left by his absence the wholc of hisfriends, with a fiend arnangst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to entcr again inta society, ond wateh him closely, anxious to f0rewarn, in spile ofhjs oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached witb intimacy. But when he entered into a room, bis haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, thot his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking,for ber sake, a \u017fociety which affecled him so strongly. When, howevcr, remonstrance proved unavailing, the gvardians thoughl proper to intcrpose, and, fearing that bi\u017f mind was becoming alienoted, they thought it high time to resume clgain thattrust which hod been before imposed upon thcrn by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and svfferingf he had daily encounlered in his wanderings, and of prevontjng him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they oonsidered folly, they erigaged a physlcian to roside in the hovse, and take con\u017ftant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so eompletely was his mind obsorbed by 0ne terrlblc subjeet. His incoherence becamo at last so great, that he was confined to his cham6er. There he wauld often lie for dclys, incapableof belng roused. Ho had become emacialed, his eyes had attained a glassy luslre;\u2014thc only sign of affection and recollectionremaining displayed itself upon the entry os his sister; then hc would somelimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would deslre her not to tauch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near hiin!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reserred, hif only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a slate, wherice not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months:gradua1ly, however, as the year was passing, his iricoherences became less frequerit, and his mind thrcw off a portion os its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the dayhe would count upon his singers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tiine had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of hls guardians entering his room, began to converse with hi\u017f physician upon the melancholy circumfta nce of Aubrey's bejng in so awful a fituation, whon his sister was going next day to bemarried. Instaritly Aubrey's attentiori wos attracted; he askedanxioufly to whom. Glad of lhls mark of returning intcllect, of which tbey feared he had beeri deprived, lhey mentionod the name of the Earl of Marsderi. Thinking this was a yovng Earl whom he had met with in soeiety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them stjll more by his expressing his lntention to be present at the nuptials, arid desiring to see his sister. They answered not, bvt in a few minules his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected 6y the irifIuence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once mare alive to the feelings of affection. He began to fpeak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulclte bor upan her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and euery accompIishment; whon he suddenly porceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding tbc features of the monster who had so long influenced bis lise. He scized the portrait in a paroxysm of rclgo, and trampled it under f0ot. Upon her asking him why he thus de\u017ftroyed the refemblancc of her future husband, be looked as if he did riot understand her\u2014then seizing her harids, and gazirig on her with a frantic expression os covntenance, he bade her swear that shewould never wed this monsler, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade bim remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven wos near him bvt sclw no one. In the meantiine the guardiclns and physician, who bad beard the whole, and thought thiswaf but a retum of bis djsorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to Ieave hiin. He fell upon his knces to thern, he implored, he hegged of lhein to delay but for one day. They, attributing this ta the insanity they imagined hcld taken pos\u017fession of his mind, endeavovred to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven hod called tbe morning after the drawing-roam, and bad becn refused with every one elso. When he hcard of Aubrey's i1l health, he readily understood himse1f to be the cause of it; but wben be learncd that he was deemod insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly he concea1ed from those among whom he bad gained this lnformation. He hastened to the house af his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and tbeprotenee of great affection for tho brother and interest in his fate, he gradually w0n the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his p0wor? His longue had dangors ond toils to rocount\u2014could speak of himself as of an lndjvidual having no sympathy witb any being on the crowded eclrtb, save with her to whomhe addressed hiinself;\u2014could te1l how, since he knew her, his existence, had 6ogun to seem worthy of preservation, if it wcre merely that he might listen to her soolhing acccnts;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent'\u017f art, or sucb was the will of fate, that be gained bor affections. The title of the elder brancb fa1ling at length to him, he obtained an irnportant embas\u017fy, which served as an excuse for bastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) whjch was lo take place lhe very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, wheri he was lcft by tbe physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the fervants, but in vain. He a\u017fked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his siftcr, conjuring her, as she valued her own bapplness, her owri honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, wha once held her in their arrns as lbeir hopeand the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that morriage, on whlch he denounced the most heavy curses. The servantf promisod they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thoughl it better not to hara\u017fs any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whal he considered, thc ravings os a maniac. Night pas sed on without rest to the busy inmates of the hou\u017fe; and Auhrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of bufy preparatlon. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avbrey grew almostfrantic. The curi0sity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, Ieaving him in the custody os an helpless oId woman. He seized the opportunity, wilh one 6ound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the opartment where all were neorlyassembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking hif arm by force, hurried him srom the r0om, speechlesf with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your 0atb, and know, if not my bride to day, yaur sister js dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the o1d woman, had c0me in seclrch of him. Aubrey could no longer support himsels; hi\u017f rage nol finding vent, hadbroken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was riat mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid of agitating her. The marriago was solemnized, and the bride and bridegro0m left London.\nAubrey's weakness increasod; the effu\u017fion os blood produced sympt0ms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be c allod, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly whot tbe reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nTbe guardians hasteried to protcct Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, ond Aubrey'f fister had glvtted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING ANACCOUNT OF LDRD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wcls all before him, w hero to choose his place of rest, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vcssels, in the year 1812, wo put int0 the harbour 0f Milylcne, in the island of that naine. The beouly of this plaee, and the certclin supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, lnduce many British vessc1s to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantinen; and though jt 1ies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for tbo deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom 0f the bay, and whilst the mcn were emplo yed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle wilh the natives, the c1ergyman and inyself took a ram ble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been beforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a sma1l monticule so named) we mct witb and engagod a young Greek as our gulde, who told us he had come from Scio with an Engl ish lord, wholeft the ifland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have token me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd,but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of lt: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his fclucca very often to the differerit islarids.\"\nThis account exoited our curiosjty very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the bouse where 0ur countryman had resided. We were kindly rcceived by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on thegraund-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, o sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. Tbey were all simply decoroted: plain green-slained walls, marble lables on ejther slde, a large myrtle in the centre, and a srnall fountain benoath, which could be made to play through the branehcs by movirig a spring fixed in the sjde of cl small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa camploted the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozon English cane chairs, and an empty boo k-case: tbere were rio mirrors, nor a single pajnting. The bedehamber had merely a large rnaltre\u017fs spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a plllow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In tbe sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told vs, fillod with books and papers, which wcre then iri a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokfpcare's,Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerrnan, in the German language; Klapstock's Messioh; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphletf from the Greek press al Conslantinaple, much to rn, but no English book of any descrlption. Most of these books were fllled with morginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. Thc Messiah wa\u017f literally scribhled alI over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remclrk\u017f.\nThe oId man said: \"The lord had been readirig lhese books the evening before he soiled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" \u017faid he, \"therc they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, tbat were I to m0ve ane thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once dld him a service; and I have the praducc of this farm for the trouhle of taking carc os it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an agod Armenian who resides in a small cotlage iri the wood, and wh0m tho lord brought here from Adrianople;I dori't know for what rea\u017fon.\"\nThe appearance of the houso externally wa\u017f plea\u017fing. The portico in front was fifty paces long arid fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars wlth black plinths and sret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were eonsiderahly higher than tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stane balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awnjng of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnifhed, as upon thern the Greek\u017f pass their evenings in smoking, drinklng light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, clnd enjoying thc evening breeze.\nOn tbe left hand as we entcrod the house, a small streamlet glided oway, grapes, aranges and limes were clustoring togetber on its b0rders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamentaI woodenback was placed, on which we were told, the Iord pasfed many of his evenings clnd nights till twelve o'clock, reoding, writing, and tolking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe viow from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vincyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, couered with olive and myrtle trees ln bloom, and on the summit of whicb an aneient Grcek temple appearcd in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, vntil it was last iri the woods near the mouritain's base. The fea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a fingle oloud, terminates the view in front; and a little 0n tbe left, through a vista of lofly chesnut and palm-trecs, fevoral small islands were distinctly o6served, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald groen. I seldom enjoycd a vjew more than I did this; bvt our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the pers0n who hcld reslded in this romantic solitvde: none knew his namo but Dominick, his banker, who had gorie to Candia. \"TheArmeriian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will nol,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If Ican,\" faid be, \"I dare riot.\" We had not timc to visil the Armenian, but an our return to lbe town we leamt soveral particulars of thc ifolated lord. He had portioned eight yourig girls when he wos last upon the ifland, andeueri danced witb them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thegirls who liue by weaving tbese articles. He also bought a new b0at for a fisherman who bad loft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a vory eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, whieh our old frjend at the cottage thought proper not to discloso. He hod a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lordwas osten seen walkjng on the sea- shore, and he bad bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himseIf tbe use af it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; 0ur imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece oould he. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark poeuliar genius. Arrjved at Palermo, clll our doubls wero dispelled. Fal1ing in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had 6oen travelling in Egypt and Greoce, \"The individual,\" faid he, \"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trclvels on the island of Tenedos, and I aIso visited him at Mitylene.\" Wo had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we hcld been \u017fome years from hame; but \"Childe Haralde\"being put into our hands we recognized lhe recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply djd we regret not having been rnore curious in ovr researches al the cottage, bvt we consoled ourselves wlth the idea of retuming to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this stalement, believing it riot quite uriinleresting, and in justice to his lordship's gaod name, which bas been grossly slandered. He has been described as of anunfeeling disposition, averse to associating wjth humon riature, or contributing in any way lo sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The facl is directly the reverse, af may bo plain1y galhered from these little anecdotes. All the finor feelirigs of the heart, so elegantly dopicted in his lordship'f poems, seem to have their seat in bis bos0m. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity oppear to guide all his aclions: and bis courting the repose af solitude is cln additional roa son for marking him a\u017f a being on whose heart ReIigion hath set her sea1, ond ouer whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thc preceding pleasing \"traits\" wilhout fceling provd of him a\u017f a countryman. Wllh respect to his loues or pleosures, I do not assume a rigbt ta give an opiriian. Reporls are evcr to be received with caution, particularly wheri directed against man's morcll iritegrity; and he who dares justjfy hjmsels besore that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fcllow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is w0rthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the worId's applause, is the sure\u017ft testirnony of a virtuous heart ond \u017feIf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crawn-courl, Fleel-street.","20":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale i\u017f founded is very goneral in the Ea\u017ft. Among the Arabions it appeors to bc common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; clndit has only assumed its prosent form sinco the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timo, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in theirterritory, it gradually inereased, and formed lhe subjecl of many wonderful stories, still ext ant, of the dead rising from their graves, clrid feeding upon the blo0d of the young clnd beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungclry, Poland, Au\u017ftrja, and Lorraine, where the belief cxisted, that vampyres nightlyimbibod a certain porti0n of the blood of their victims, who bceame emaciated, lost their strengtb, and speedily djed of consvmptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their vein\u017f becamo distended to such a stote of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from aIl the passages of th eir bodief, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, crediblo account of a particular case of vampyrism, which i\u017f stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It oppearf, that upon an exclmlnation of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of lhe ploce, they positiuely and unonimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, namod Arnold Paul, had beeri heard to say, that, at Cassovja, on the frontiers of the Turkish Seruia, he had been tarmented bya vampyre, but had found a way ta rid himself of the evil, by eatirig some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing bimself with his blood. This precautjon, however, did not prevent him sroin becoming a vampyre himsels; for, about twenty or thirty days after hls death and burial, mony persoris complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of lise by bis attacks. To prevent furlher mischief, the inhabitclnts hauing consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in casos of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the inouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to theaccustomed remedy. A stake was drivon entirely tbrough lhe heart and body of Arnold Paul, al which he is reported to hove cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into hi\u017f grave. The sarne measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyri\u017fm, lest they should, in their tum,become agents upon otherf who survived lhem.\nThe universal 6elief is, tbat a person sueked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThls moristrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of lhe prefent observations than any other inftance which could bc adduced. In many parts of Greece il is con \u017fidered as a fort of puni\u017fbment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilsl in existence, that the deceased is not only do0med to vclmpyrise, but compolled to confine hi\u017f infemal vi\u017fitations solely to those beings he laved most while upon earth\u2014those to whoin he was bound by ties af kindrod and affection.\u2014A supposition al1uded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall srom its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blaod of all thy race; There from thy daugbter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thau evr\u017fing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stom. But one thatfor thy crirne must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thce with cl father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flarne! Yet thou must end thy tclsk and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which sree2es o'er its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hand shclll tear The tresfes of her ye1low hoir, Of whicb, in life a lock when shorn Affectian's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borrie away by theo Memoriol os thine agony! Yet with thine own bestblood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tootb, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014clnd with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in harror sbrink clway From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also intraduccd in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corsc of the Arabian maid Onei2a, who is represenled as having returned from the gravc for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existerice. But thls cannot be supposed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being p0urtrayed throughout the whole of lhe tale as a oomplete type of purlty and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of soveral astonishing casef of vampyrism, to which be pretends to have beeri an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of ils effects, has pul forth some learned dissertati0ns, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well os barborian error.\nMany curious and jnteresting notices on this singvlarly horrible superstition might be added; thovgh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarlly devoted ta explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely reinarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one iri mast generol acceptation, there are soveral olhers \u017fynonymous with it, madc use of in various parts of tbe world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHEVAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations atteridclnt upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of thc ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his slngularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, lhe light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a laok quell it, and throw foar into those breasts where thoughtlessncs\u017f reigned. Those who felt this serisatlon of awe, couId not explain whence it arose: same attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did nol seem to penetrote, orid at orie glanco lo pierce through to lho inward workings of the hearl; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray thclt weighed upon the skin itcould not pass. Hjs peculiarities caused bim to be inuited to every house; all wi\u017fhed to see him, and lhose who had been accustomcd to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasedat having sometbing in lheir prescncc capable of erigaging their ottention. In spite of the deadIy hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or frointhe str0ng emotion of passion, though its forrn and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntors after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, atleast, some marks os what they inight term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put 0n the dress of a mounte6ank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she \u017ftood before him, though hi\u017f eyes were apparently fixed upan her's, still it seemed cls is they were unperceived;\u2014even herunappalled impudence was baffled, and she lest the field. But tbough the commori adultress could nol influenoe even the gujdance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparerit caution with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed hjmself lo females. He had, howovor, the reputation of a winning tongve; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that tbey were m0ued by his apparent hatrcd ofvice, he was af often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as omang thaso who sully it by their viccs.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sifter in the possession of great wcalth, by parerits who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardiclns,who thovght jt their duty meroly lotake care of his fortune, whjle they relinquished the more important charge of his mlnd to tbe core of merconary subalterns, he cultivatcd moro his imagination than his judgment. Ho had,hence, that high romantjc feeling of honour and condour, which daily ruins \u017fo many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise wjtb virtue, and thought that vice was throwri in 6y Providence merely for the picturesque effect 0f the seene, os we fee in romances: he thoug ht that the misery of a cottage merely con\u017fisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye 6y their irregular folds and vclrious coloured patchos. He lhovght,in fine, that the dreams of poets were the rea1ities of life. Ho was handsome, srank, and ricb: for those reasons, upon his entering jnto the gay circles, inany mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with Ieast truth their languishing 0r romplng favourites: the daughters clt the same time, by their brigh tening couritenances whcn he approached, and by their sparklirig eyes, when he opened hls lips, soori led him into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled clt finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not fromthe presence of a ghost, but fr0m want of snuffing, there was no fouridation in real life for any of that congeries of pleaslng piotures and descriptions coritained in thosc volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some comperifotion in his gratified vanity, he was abaut to reljnquish his dreams, wheri lhe extraordinary being we bave abovc described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho very irnpossibility of forming an idea of the character of a mari entireIy absorbed in hlmself, who gave few other signs af his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidanoo of their contact: cllIawing his imagination to picture every thing tbat flattered its propensily to cxlravagant ideas, he soon formed tbis ohjcct into thc hera of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acqvainted with him, paid him attentjons, and so far aduanced upon hif notice, that his prescnce wos always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes ofpreparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about lo travel. Desirous of gaining someinformation respecting this singulor character, who, till now, had only wbetted his curiasity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable lhe young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice toward\u017f putting themselves upan an equality with the aged, and not allowing them lo clppear as lf fallen fr0m the skie s, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mcntioned as the subjects of ploasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to jojn him. Flattered by such o mark of esteem from him, who, clpparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they bad passed the circllng waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he fou nd, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclu sions from the apparent motiues to hi\u017f conduct. His companion was profuse in hi\u017f liberality;\u2014the idle, the vclgobond, and the beggar, received fr0m his hand mare than enough to relievo their immediate wants. But Aubrey cou Id not clvoid remarking, that jl was not upon the uirtuouf, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant everi upon uirtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sont from the door with hardly suppresscd sneers; but when the profligatc came to ask sometbing, not to relieve his wonts, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, bowever, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which genera1ly prcvails over the retiring bafhfulne\u017fs of thc virtuous indigent. There was one circumstonce about the charity of his Lordship, whicb was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the Iowest and the inost abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns throvgb w hich they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which hif companion sought for the centres of all fashionab1e vice; there ho entered lnto all lhe spiritof thefaro tab1e: he betted, and always gambled with success, excepl where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even inore than he gained; but it was olways with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched thc s0ciety around: it was not, however, so whon he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed f0rtvne's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, arid his eyes sparkled witb more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-decld mouse. In every town, he lefl the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle he adarned, cursing, in the soljtude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him wlthin lhe reach 0f lhis fiend; whilst mony cl father sat frantic, amidst the speaking look\u017f of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealtb, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their preserit craving. Yel he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsivo grasp of the innocent: this might but be the resv1t of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, h0wever, capable af oombating lhe cunning of the more experienced. Au6rey often wishcd to represent this to his friend, and beg him to reslgn that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own prosit;\u2014but he deloyed it\u2014for cach day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to bim; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven jn his carriage, and amjdst the various wild and rich scene\u017f of nature, was always thesame: his eye spokeless than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greator gratification from it than the coristant excitement of vainlywishing to breclk lhat mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume tbe appearance of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his compani0n; he left bim in daily attcndarice upon tbo morning circle of ari Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he 0pened wlth eoger impatience; the first was from his sister, 6reathirig nothing 6ut affection; tbe others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagination thatthere was an evil power re sident in his companion, these seemed to give him sussicient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon hif lmmediately lcaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his ljcentious habits more dangeraus lo society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had rcquired, to enhanoc his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urisullied virtue, down t0 the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all thase femalef wbom he had sougbt, apparentlyon accaunt of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled ta expose the whale deformity of their vices to the publlc gaze.\nAubrey delermined upori leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjrigle brightpoint on which to rcst the eye. He resolvedto inuerit some pIausible prelext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean wbile, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, clnd soori perceived, lhat his Lordsbip wos endeavauring to work upon the inexperience af the daughterof the lady wbose houfe he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with ln society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plclns in secret; hut Aubrey's eye followed himin all his windings, and soon difcovered that an assigriation had been appointed, which would most likcly erid in the ruin of an jnnocent, though thaughtless girl. Losing no tirne, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respoct to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his bejng about to meet her that very nighl. Lord Ruthven answered, that hjf intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an ocoasion; and upon being pressed w hether he intended to marry hor, meroly laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment be must decline clccompanying his Lordship in theremainder of thelr proposod tour, he ordered bis servant to seek other apartments, and calling vpan tho mothcr of the lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the choractcr of his Lordshlp. The assignatiori was preve-\nnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his fervant to notify hls complete assent to a sepclration; but did not hint clny sus-\npicion of his plclns baving been foiled by Auhrey's interp0sition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossirig the Peninfula, soon found bimself at Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the hovse ofa Greek; arid soon occvpicd himself in lracing the faded records of ancient glory upon inonumenls thot apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemon only before slaves, had bidden th emselues beneath the shelterjng soil or mariy coloured licheri. Under the same r0of as himsolf, existed a being, \u017fo beautisul and delicate, that sbe might have formed the madel for a pointer wishing to pourtray on convclss the prornised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke t0o much mind for any orie to think she could belong to those who had no sauls. As she danoed upon the plain, or tripped along the mounlain's side, one would bave thovght lhe gazelle a poor type 0f her boauties; for who would havo exchanged her eye, apparenlly the eye of ariimated naturo, forthat sleepy luxurious look of the anjmcll suited but to thc taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acoompanied Avbrey in his \u017fearch afler antiquities, and often w0uld tbe uncorisoious girl, cngaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty af her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagor gaze of him, who forgotthe letters he had just deoyphcred upon an almo\u017ft effaced tablet, in the coritemplation of her sylpb-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, as sheflilted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delioately brillianland swiftly fading hues, il migbt well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape frorn his mlnd the very object he hcld before thought of vital importance ta the proper interpretation of a possage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocerice, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawirig-rooms arid stiflirig balls. Whilst he drew tho\u017fe remains of which he wished to preserve o memorial for his future hours, she would sland by, and watch the mogic effects of his penciI, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the circling dance upon the open ploin, wauld paint, to him in all tbe glowing co1ours of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp she remernbered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evideritly made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell hlm all tbe supematural tales of her nurse. Her e clrnestness arid apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled the interesl even of Aubrey; and often as she told hiin the tale of the livjng vclmpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to proIong his existence for the ensuirig months, his blood would run cold, whilsthe attempted to laugh her out of svch idlc and horrible fantafles; but Ianthe cited to him the namef of old men, who had at last dclected one living among lhem\u017felves, after several of theirnear relatives and chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, sbe begged of him to believe her, for il bad b een, remarked, that those who bad dared to question their existence, always had some proof givon, which obliged tbem, with grief clnd heartbreaking, to confess it was lrue. She detailed lo bim the lraditlonal appeorance of these monsters, and his horror wa\u017f increased,by hearirig o pretty clccurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her seors, though clt the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in thesupernatural po wer of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey bcgan to altach himself more arid more to Ianthe; her innocence, sa contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he bad sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari unedueated Gre ek girl, still he found himself mare and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himsolf at tirncs srom her, clnd, forming a plari for some antiquariari research, hewould depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; bvt he always found it irnpossible to fix his clttentiori upon the ruiris around him, whilst in his mind be retclined an image that seemed alone tbe rightfuI possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uneonscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She olways seemed lo part from biin with reluctance; but il wcls because she bad no longer clny one with whom she could vislt her fav-\nourite haurits, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching 0r uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to ber parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. S0on aftcr, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of bis excursions, which was to detairi him for a few hours; when theyheard the name of lhe place, tbey all at once begged of him not to returnat night, as he must necessarily pass through a waod,where no Greek would ever remain, after the doy had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the mosl hoavy evils as impending upon him wbo dared to cross thejr path. Aubrey made ligbt of their representatioris, and tried to lavgh them out of the idea; but when he saw them sbudder at hif darlng thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNexl morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unottended; he was surprised to observe the melancboly face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earriestly begged of bim to return, ere night ollowed the power of these beings to be pul iri actjon;\u2014bo promised. He was, howcver, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and lhat in the hori2on there was one os those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidIy gother into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counlry.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his ha rse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: butil was too late. Twilight, in these southerri climates, ls almost urikriown; immediately the \u017fun sets, night begins: andere he had advanced far, thepower of the storm was above\u2014its echoing tbunders had scarcely ari interval of resl\u2014its tbick heavy rain forced its woy through the canopyirig foliage, whilst tbe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took frighl, and be was carried with drcadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and be found, by the glare of ligbtning, that he was in the neighbourhaod of a hovel that hardly lifted ltself up srom lhe masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he clpproached, hoping to find some one to guidehim to the t0wn, or at least trvsting to obtain she1ter from the pelting of the storin. As he approclched, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womari mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was start-\nled: but, roused by the thunder which agclin rolled over his head, he, witb a sudden effort, forced openthe door of the hut. Hefound himself in uttor darkness: the sound, h0wevcr, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he colled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was takeri of him. He f0und himself in cantact with some one, whom hc immedialely sejzod; when o vaice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whlch a l0ud laugh succeeded; and he felthimself grappled by one wbose strength seemed superhuman: determjned to sell his lifc as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the gr0und:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon bim, and kneeling up0n his breast, had placed his hands upon his tbroat\u2014when the glaro of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave ljghtin the day, d lsturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, Ieaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as hebroke through tbe wood, was no longer heard. Tbe storm was n0w still; and Aubrey, incapable of m0ving, was soon heard by lhose without. They entered; the light of their torchef fell upon the mud wa1ls, and the lhatch loaded on every individual straw wilh heclvy flakes of foot. At tbe desire of Avbrey tbey searohed for her who had attracted bimby her cries; he was again left ln dclrknesf; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more bvrst upon him, to pcrcei ve lhe airy form of his fair conductross brought in a lifeless corse. He shut hif eyos, hopirig that it was but a vision arislng from bis disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. Tbere wa\u017f rio colour upori her cheek, not even upon ber lip; yet there was a \u017ftillness about her face lhat seemed almosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having openedthe vein:\u2014to lhis the men pointed, cryirig, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was 1aid by the side of her who had lately been to him tbe objecl of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died withiri her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbod and seemed to shun reflection, and tclke refuge jn vacancy\u2014he held alrnost uneonsciously iri his hand a naked dagger ofa particular constructian, whicb had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been erigaged in the search of her whorn a motber hadmissed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful ccltastrophe. \u2014To describe their griof would be impos\u017fible; but when they a\u017fcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked atAubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were incorisolable; both died brokeri-hearted.\nAubrey being pul to bed wa\u017f seized with a mo\u017ft violent fever, and was often delirious; in these interval\u017f be would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountabIe eombination he scemed to beg of his former companiori to spare the beirig he loved. At othor times he would imprecate maledictionf upon bis head, ond curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ehanced atthis timc lo arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hear jng of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecamc his constant attendant. When the latter recouered srom his delirium, he was horrified and starlled at thesight of him whose image he had n0w combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hjs kirid words, impIying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more bythe attention, anxiety, and cclre which he showed, s0on reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no Ionger appeared that apathetic being wba had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon os his convalescence began to berapid, he again g radually retjred into the sarne state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from tbe former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet bis gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of ma1icious oxultation playing upan hif lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunled him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparcntly engaged in watching tbe tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in markirig the progres\u017f of lhose orbs, circling, like our world, lhe moveles\u017f sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish t0 avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waf much weclkened, and that e1asticity of spirit whioh had 0nce so distinguished hirn now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbaurhood of Atbens; if he s0ught it amidst the rvin\u017f he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by bis side\u2014if he soughl il in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly tvrning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He deterrnined to fly scenes, every feature of which created suoh bitter as\u017fociations in his mind. He proposed to Lard Ruthven, ta whom he held himsolf bound by the tender care he had taken of him duririg his ilIness, that tbey should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. Thcy travelled in every direction, and sought evcry spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They beard much of robbers, but they gradually bcgan t0 slight these reports,which they imagined were 0nly tbe invenlion of jndividuals, whose intercst it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In oonsequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasi0n they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve a\u017f guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, ot the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large mosfes of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negIigence; for scarc ely were tho whole of the party enga ged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bulIets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guns. In an instant their gvards had left thom, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the directlonwhenoe the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, imilating the ir example, retired for a moment behirid the sheltering turn of lhe defile: but ashamed of bcing thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade them advance, and beirig exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbors should climb above and take them in the rear, lhcy delermined at 0nce to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to tbe ground. Aubroy hostcned to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contesl or his own peril, was soon surprised by seejng the robbers' faces around him\u2014his gvards having, upon L0rd Ruthven's being wounded, immediately tbrown vp their clrms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey so0n induced thcm to convey his w0unded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransam, he was no m0re dislurbed by their presenoc\u2014they beirig content meroly to guard the entrance lill thelr comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two dclys mortification orisued, clnd death secmed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not ehanged; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last euening, his mind became apparent1y uneclsy, and his eye often fixed upan Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! yau may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, yaur friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do ariy thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I necd but little\u2014my life ebb\u017f apace\u2014I carinot expIain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honovr were free from staln in tbe world's mouth\u2014and if mydeath wero vnknown f0r same time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be kriown.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rajsing himself witb exultant violenco, \"Swear 6y all your soul reveres, by all your naturc fear\u017f, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your know1edge of my crirnes or death to any living belng in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hjs pillow, and 6reathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with tbis man rose upon his mind, and he know not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came ovor him, as is from the presentiment of sornething horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the m0rning, he was abovt to enter tho hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed hiin that it was no longer therc, having beeri conveyed by himself and comra des, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, acc0rding to a pramise they had given his lordship, that it should he exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several os the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bul, when he had mourited to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clotbes,though the robbers swore they pointcd out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returried, convjnced that they had bvried tho eorpfe far the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of cl covntry in which he had met wilh svch tcrrible misforturies, and in which all apparenlly oonspired to heighten that \u017fuperstitious melancholy that had seized uponhis mind, be resolved to leave it, arid soon arrjved at Smyma. While waitirig for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied him\u017felf in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhvon. Amongst other things thero was cl case containing seueral weapons of offenco, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. Tbere were several daggers clnd ataghan\u017f. Whilst turning them over, ond examining their curiovs formf, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently ornamented in tho same style cls the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014bastening to gain fvrther proof, he faund the weapon, and his horror may be imaglried when he discovered that it fitted, though peouliarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular f orm, thesame varylng tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both,and left no room for daubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sinyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, hjs first inquiries were conceming the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arls. Her parentf were in di\u017ftress, their fortunc ruined, and she had not been be ard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrcy's mind became almost broken urider so mony repeated horror\u017f; he was asraid that lhis lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He becamc morose arid silent; and his only occupatjon eonsisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the lise of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which soemed obedienl to his will, soon wafted him to the English shore\u017f; and he hostened lo the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to losc, in the embra ces and cclresses of his sister, a1l memory of the pasl. If she before, by her infantine caressos, had gained his affection, now that the woman began ta appear, she was still more attclching as a companion.\nMiss Au6rey had not that winning grace which gainf the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none os that light brilliancy which only exists iri the heated atmosphere of acrowded aparlment. Her blue eye wa\u017f never llt up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did nat seem to arise from misfortune, but from some fecling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not tbat llght footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colaur may attract\u2014it was sedale and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her br0ther breathed to her his affeclion, and would in her presenee forget thofe grief\u017f she knew destroyed his rest, who would have cxchanged her fmile f0r that of the voluptuary? It seemcd asif those eyes,\u2014that face were thcn playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, ond had not been presenled to the warld, it having been thaugbt by hor guardians mare fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the riext drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the ep0ch ofher entry irilo the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have romainod iri tbe mansion af his fatbcrs, and fod upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interefl about the frivolities of fashionabIc strangers, when his mirid had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but hc determined to sacrifice hjs own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in lown, and prepared for the next day, which had been arin0vnced as a drawing-room.\nThe orowd was excessivc\u2014o drawing-room had not been held for a long tlme, and all who were anxi0vs to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was thore with hjs sister. Whlle he was standing in a corner by himself, hcedless of alI arovnd him, engaged in the remembrance that the first tlme ho hod seen Lord Ruthven was in that very pIace\u2014he felt himself suddenly seizedby tbe arm, arid o voice he rocogni2ed too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Rernember your oath.\" Ho had hardly courage lo tvrn, fearful of seeing a spectre tbat wouId blclst him, when he perceivod, at a ljttle distanco, lhe same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almast refusing to bear their weighl, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through thecr0wd, be lhrew himso1f into his earri age, arid was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, ond fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from bis broiri. Lord Ruthvon again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadfvl array\u2014the daggcr\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not belioveit possihle\u2014thedead rlse again!\u2014He thought hi\u017f imagination had coniured up the image his mind was resting upon. Il was impossible that it could be real\u2014hc detormined, therefore, to go again into sociely; for thougb he clttempted to ask conceming Lord Ruthven, the name bung vpon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insormation. He went a few nights after with his sister lo the assembly of a near relaliori. Leaving her under the pr0tection of a inatran, he retired into a recess, and there gave hlmsolf up to his own devouring tboughtf.Perceiving, at last, that many were loavlng, he roused hjmself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in earnest conver\u017fation; be attempted topass and get near her, wbenone, whomhe requested tomove, turned rourid, and revealed to him those featvres he most abhorred. He sprarig forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, soreed her towards the street: at lhe door he found bimself impeded by tbe crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; arid while he was engaged in possing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached bome.\nAubrey became alm0st distroctod. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was jt engrossed, now that the certainty of the monfter's living again pressed upon hif thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, ond it was in vain that she lntreated hiin to explain to her what had eaused hi\u017f abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The rnore he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hls oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upan his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspici0ns, who would belleve him? He thovght of employing his awn hond to frec tho world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in tbis state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and atc only when his sjster came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, far her sake, t0 support nalure. At last, no langer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his houfe, roamod from street to street, anxiaus to fly that image which haunted bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but al last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his fafety, employed peoplo to follow him; bvt they were soon distanocd by him who fIcd from a pvrsuer swister than any\u2014from tho ught. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea thclt he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst thom, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to onter again into society, and watch hlm closely, arixi0us to forcwarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached wjth intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderirigs so visib1e, that his sister was at 1ast obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Whon, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, lhe guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mlnd was becoming alienated, they thought it high tiine toresume againthat trust which had 6ecn before imposed upon thern by Aubrey's parents.\nDe sirous of sclving him from lhe injuries andsufferings he had daily encountcred in his wanderings, and of preventjng him from exposing to the general eye tbose rnarks os what they considered foIly, they engaged cl physician to reside in the house, and lake constant cclre os him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his inind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence 6ecame at last so great, that he was eonfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, inoapable of being roused. He bad become emaciatcd, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and rocollectian remaining displayed itself upori the entry of his sister; then he w ould sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks tbat severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not toucb him\u2014if your l0ve for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Whcn, howev-\ner, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence nol even sbo cauld rouse him. This lasted rnany months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and bi\u017f mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardian\u017f observed, tbat sevcral times in the day ho would count vpon his fingers a definite number, and theri smile.\nThe timehad nearly elapsod, when, upan tho last day of the year, one of his guardians entoring his room, began lo convcrse with his physician upon the melancholy eircumstanoe of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was golng next dcly to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attentiori was attracted; he a\u017fked anxiously to whom. Glad of tbis mark of returnjng intellect, of which they fearcd he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Eclrl of Marsden. Thinking this was a yourig Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey soemed pleased, arid astonished them ftill more by his expressing bis inlention to be present ot the nuptials, and dcsiririg to see hls sistcr. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sistcr was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irisluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed hcr to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thoughtof her brotber's being once inore alive to the feelings of affectiori. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage wilh a perfon so distinguished for rank and every acc0inplishmerit; when he suddenly perceived a locket vpon her breast; operiing it, what was his svrprise at beholding the features of the manster who had so long influenced his llfe. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orid trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future hvsband, be lo0ked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on hcr wlth a fraritic expressi0n of countenanee, he bade her swear that she would never wcd this monstcr, for he\u2014 But he eould not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice agajn bade him remember his oath\u2014he tvrned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthven waf noar him but saw no one. In the meantimethe guardians and physiciari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relurn of hi\u017f disorder, eritered, and forclng him from Miss Aubrey, desired hor to loave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be implored, he bogged of them to doloy bvt for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone elsc. When he beard of Aubrey's ill health, he readjly understood bimself to be the cause of it; but when he leorned that he was deemed insane, his exullation and pleasuro could hardly be concealed srom those ainong whom be had gained this iriforination. He haftened to the house of hjs former companion, and, by constarit atlendance, and the pretence of great affection far the brolher and interest in his fate, he gradually wori the eor os Miss Aubrey. Who could rcsist his power? His tongue had dclngors and toils to recount\u2014could speak of hjmfels as of an individual hauing no sympathy with any being on the erowded earth, sove wilh her to whom he addressed himfelf;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his exjstence, had begun to seem worthy of pre\u017fervation, if it were merely that be might Iisten to ber soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use thc serpent's art, or sucb was the will of fate, lhat he gained her affections. The tjtle of the elder 6ranch falllng at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as ari cxcufe for hastening tho inarriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to lake place lhe very day before his departure for the conlinent.\nAubroy, when he waf left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He a\u017fked for pen clnd paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she volued her own happjness, hcr own horiour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who ance held her in their clrms as tboir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hovrs that morriage, on which he denounced the rnosl heavy curses.Tho servants promised they would deliver it; butgiving it to the physician, be thoughl it bettor not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a mariiac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmatos ofthe house; ond Aubrey heard, witb a horror tbat moy more oasily be conceived than described, the nates of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avbrey grewaImost frclntic. The curiosity of the scruarits at lclst 0vercame their vigilance, they gradually stoIe away, leaving him in the custody of ari helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bovrid wcls ovt of the room, and in a momcnt found himsclf in the apartment where alI were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the flrst to perceive hjm: he immediately approacbed, and, taking his orm by sorcc, hvrried him from the room, \u017fpeechless with ragc. When on tbe staircafe, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his eclr\u2014\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride lo day, your sister is dishorioured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him toward\u017f hls attendarits, who, roused by the o1d woman, had come in seareh of him. Au6rey could no longer support himself; his rage n0t finding vent, bad broken a blood-vessel, and he was conueyed to bed. This was not mentioncd lo his sister, who wasnot present when he entered, as the phyfician was afraid of agitoting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAubrey's weakriess increased; the effusion of blood prodvced symptoms of the near opproach of death. He desjred hif sister's guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related compo sedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when lhey arrived, it was too lote. Lord Ruthven had disappeclred, and Avbrey's \u017fister had g1utted thc thlrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF L0RD BYRON'S RESIDENCEIN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before bim, where to choose his place of rest, and Providerice his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mityleric, in the island of thal name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetahles always to be had thore, induee many Britisb vesseIs to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantinen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation ofa voyage. We landcd; as usual, at the boltom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walering, and the purser bargaining sor cottle with the natives, the clergyman and myself taok o ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and olhor places, where we had boeri bofore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us be had come from Scio witb an Eng1ish lord, who left the island four dayspreviouf lo our arrival in hls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and w0uld have taken mo with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good inan. The cottage aver the hill, facing lhe river, belongs to him, and he has left an old inan in charge of il: he gavo Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred 2echines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided thore abaul fourteen m0nths, though not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the different island\u017f.\"\nThis accourit excited our ouriasity very mvch, and we lost no time in hostening to tbe house whore our countryman had resjded. We were kindly receiued by an old man, who coriductod us over thc mansion. It consisted of fovr apartments on the ground-fIoor\u2014an entrance hall, adrawing-room, a \u017fittirig parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious cl0set annexed. They were all simply decorated: ploin green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centrc, arid a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the brclnches by movlng a spring sixedin tbe side os a smal1 bronze Venus in o leariing posture; a largc couch or sofa compleled tbe furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen Engli\u017fh cane chairf, and an cmpty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. The bedchainber had merely a large mattre\u017fs spread on the floor, wjth two stuffed cotton quiltf and a pillow\u2014the oommon bed throughoul Greece. In the sittlng-room we obserued a marble recess, formerIy, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whicb were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justifjed in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bail-\neau's, arid Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermon, in the German language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradisc Last, an Italian odition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampb1ets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tom, but rio English book of any doscription. Most of thesc books were filled with marginal notes, wrilten wilb a pencil, in Italicln and Lotin. The Messiah was literally scribblcd all over, arid markod wilh slips of paper, on which also were rcmarks.\nThe old mon sald: \"Tbe lord had been reading thcse books the eveningbef0re he salled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lio until his return; for hc is so particular, that were I to mave orie thingwithout orders, he wov ld frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did hlm a service; and I have the produce af thif farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arrnenian who resides in a sinall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know sor wbat reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externalIy was pleasing. The portico in front waf fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and tho fluted marble pi1lars with black plinths andfret-work carnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the r0of. The roof, surrovnded by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fino Turkey carpet, benealh an awning of strong coarselinen. Moft of lhe house-tops are thus furnished, as upon thein the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, dr inking lighl wines, such as \"lachryma chr isti,\" eating fruit, andenjoying the evening breezc.\nOn the left hand as wc entered the houfe, a smaIl streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limef were clustering together on its bordors, and urider the shade of two lclrge myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornam ental wooden back was placed, on whicb we were told, the lord passed many os his eve-\nnirigs and nightf till twelve o'clook, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man, \"prayirig\" for hewas very devout, \"and always altended our church twice a weok, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be tormed \"a bird'f-eye view.\" A lino of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and ori the summit of which an anc ient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smaIl stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it wos lost in the woods neclr the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed by a singleeloud, terminates the view in sront; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and paIm-trees, seve ral small islands wcre distinclIy observed, \u017ftudding the light blue wave with \u017fpots of emerald green. I se1dorn enjoycd a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitIess asto the name of the pcrson who had resided in this ramantic solitudo: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"Is I oan,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" Wo had not lime to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt sevoral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow lo one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who livoby weavirig the\u017fe articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost hisown in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared lo uf, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benovolent charaoter. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a moft beautisul daughter, withwhom tbe lord was often secn walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had 6oughl her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmatiori with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mjtylene; our imaginations clll on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greecc could be. He had money it was evident: be had philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecccntricilies which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubt\u017f were dispellod. Falling in company wlth Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who bad heen travolling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I a1so visited him al Mitylene.\" We had never then heord of hls lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaroIde\" being put into our bands we recognized the reoluse of Calcla in every poge. Deeply did we regret not having been more curjous in our researches at the cotlage, but we consolod ours elues with the idea of returning to Mitylene on soine future doy; but to me that day will never return. I inake this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grosfly slandered. He has been described as of an unseeling disposition, overse to assoclating with humannalure, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. Tbe sact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted jn hjf lordship's pocms, seem to havo their seat in bis bosom. Tenderness, sympath y, and charity appear to guide all hi\u017f actions: and hjs courting the repo\u017fe os solitude ls an additional reoson for marklng him as a being on whofe hearl Roligion halh set her \u017feal, and over whose head Benevalence hath thrown her manlle. No man can read the preceding ploasirig \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryinan. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to gjve an opinion. Reports are ever to be rccejved with caution, particularly when directed ogainst man's morol integrily; and he who dares justlfy himself before thatawful trihunal wbero all must appear, alone may cen\u017furo the crrors os a sellow-morta1. Lord Byron'f character is worthy of hi\u017f genius. To do good in secret, and shuri the world's applause, ls lho surest testimony of a virtuous hcart and self-clpproving conseience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","21":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon whioh thi\u017f tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to 6e comman:it didriol, howeuer, extend itself to the Greeks unti1after the establishinent af Christianity; clnd it has orily assumed its presonl farm sirioe the division of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thot a Latjn body c0vld not corrupl if burled in their territory, it gradually increased, and formcd the subiect of many wonderful stories,still cxlant, of the dead rising frorn thoir graves, and feeding upon the bload os the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and L orraine, wherc the belies existed, that vampyres riightly imbibed a certalri portion os lhe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consurnption\u017f; whilsl these human blaod-suckers fattened\u2014ond their veins becamedistended to such a state of replelion, as to cause the blood ta flow from oll tbe passages of their bodies, and even from the very poref of their skjns.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credible accovnl of a pclrticular case of vampyrism, which is staled to have occurred at Madroyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chicf and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously afsirmed, thal, about five years bofore, a eortajn Heyduke, riamed Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the frantiers of the Turki\u017fh Servia, he had been tormented by cl vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himsolf of the evil, by eating some of the earth aut of the vamp-\nyre's grave, and rubbing himsolf with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hjmself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons comp1ained of having been tormerited by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitanls having consultcd their Hadagrii, took up the body, and fovnd it (af is supposed lo be usua1 in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from eorruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fl0rid blood. Proos having been thus obtained, they resorted to thc accu\u017ft0med reinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body af Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hclve cried out as dreadsully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, bur ned hi\u017f bady, and threw tbe ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the eorses of lhase persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, 6ecome agerits upon olhers who survived thom.\nThc universal bolief is, that cl person sueked by a vam-\npyrc becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is bere related, bec ause it seems better cldapted to illustrate the subject of tbe presenl obfervations than any other lnstance which could be adduced. In many partf of Greece il i\u017f considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heirious crime committed wbilst in existence, that the deoeased is not only doomed to uampyrise, but compeIled to confine hi\u017f infernal visitatlons so1ely to those heings heloved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties os kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, a\u017f Vainpyre sent, Thy c0rse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly havnt the native place, And suck the blood af all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnjght drain the stroam of life; Yet loathe the banq uet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursirig thee, thou cursjng them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shal1 wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou inuft end thy task and mark Her cheek's laft tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the lasl glassy glanco must view Whioh freezes o'er its lifele\u017fs blue; Then with unhallowed hclnd sha1l tear Tbe tresses of ber yellow hair, Of whlch, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now ls borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet wilh thine own best blood sball drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and wlth Gouls and Afrits raue, Till these ln horror shrjnk away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him fhe best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resu1tcd from the sinsulness of her life, she being pourtrclyed througbout the whole of the tclle as o c0mplete type of purity and lnnocence. The veracious Taurnefort gives a long account in his traveIs of severa1 astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he prctendsto have been ari eycwitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its efsects, has put f0rth some learned dissertatjons, tending to prove it to be a elas\u017fical, as well as barbaricln errar.\nMany curiou\u017f and interesting nolices on lhis sirigularly horrible superstitjon might be addod; though the present may susfice for the limits of a note, riecessarily deuoted to explanalion, orid which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the terin Varnpyre is the one in most gene-\nral acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various pclrts of the world: as Vrouc0locha, Vardoulacha, Gaul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the mjdst of the dissipationsattendant upon cl London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, moro remarkable f0r his singularilies, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could nol participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his altention, that he rnight by a look quell it, and tbrow fear into those breasts where thaughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could n0t explain whence it arose: some attributed it to tho dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance lo piorce through lo the inward workings of the heart; bul fell upon tbe cheek wlth a Ieaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities causcd him tobe invited to every house; al1 wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to vlolent excitement, and n0w felt the weight of enriui, were pleased at having something in their prefenco capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained o warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though it\u017fform and outlirie were beautiful, many of the female hunlor\u017f after notoriety attempted ta win his attention\u017f, and gain, at least, \u017fome marks of what they rnight torm asfection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw her\u017felf iri his way, and did all but put on the dress af a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood boforc him, thaugh hls eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it scemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the fieId. But though the common adullress could not influcnce even the guidonce of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent lo him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, tbat few knew he ever addressed himsclf to fcmales. He had, however, tbe reputation of a winning tongue; clnd whether it waf that it even overc-\name the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by bis apparent hatred of vlce, he was as often among thoso females who form the boa\u017ft of their sex srom tbeir domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vjces.\nAbout the same tiine, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Auhrcy: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by pclrents who died while he was yel in childhaod. Left also to himseIf by guardjans, who thoug ht it tbeir duty morely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit cbarge of hi\u017f mind to tbe oare of mercenary svbalterns, he cultivatcd more his imaginalion than his jvdgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily rui ns so many rnilliners' apprentices. He believed all to fympathise with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown in by Prouidence merely for the picturcsque effeot of the sceno, os we sec iri romancef: he thought tbat the misery 0f acotlage merely consisted in the veslingof clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thoughl, in fine, that the dreams of poets were tho realities of life. Ho was handsome, frank, and rich: for thcse reasons, upon his entering into thc gay circles, many mothers surr0unded hirn, striving which should describe with least truth their lariguishirig or romping favourites: the daughters at the same tjme, by their brighteriing countenances when he approached, and by thejr sparkIing eyes, wben he opened his Ilps, soon led himinto false notians of his talents and his merit. Attached as he waf to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starlled at fjnding, that, except in the ta1low and wax candles lhat fllckered, not from the presence of a gbost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatlon in real life for any of that congerles of pleasing pictures and descriptions contclined in those volurnes, from whicb he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compcnsation in hi\u017f gratjfied vanity, he was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinory being we have above desoribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbo very impossibility of forming an idea of tbe character of a man entirely absor6ed ln hjmse1f, who gclve few other signs of hi\u017f 0bservation of exterrial object\u017f, thcln the ta cit assent to their existence, implied bythe avoldance of their contact: allawing his imagination to picture euery thirig that flatterod its propensity to exlravagant ideas, he soon formed this objecl into the hero 0s o romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rclther than the persori hefore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon bis notice, tbat his presence was always recognlsed. Ho gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affalrs were embarras\u017fed, arid soon found, from the noles of preparation in \u2014 Street, lhat ho was about ta travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting lhis singular character, who, till now, had only whetted hiscuriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, whieh for inany generations has been thought neoessary to enable the young lo toke some rapid sleps in the careor of vice towards pulting lhemselves upon an equalitywith tbo aged, and not aIlowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandcllous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or af prclise, accarding ta the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immodiately mentioning his lntentlon\u017f to Lord Rutbven, wos surprised to receive from him a propasal to join him. Flattered by such cl mark of esteem frorn him, who, apparently, had nothing jn common with other men, ho gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubreyhad had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven'f character, and riow he found, that, though many more of hjs actioris were oxpo\u017fed to his view, the results ofsered different conclusions fr0m the apparent motives to his conduct. His cornpclnion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from hif hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubroy c0uld not clvoid remarking, thot it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigoncc by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door wilh bardly suppressed sneers; bul when the profligate came to afk somcthing, nat lo relieve hif wants, but to allow him towallow inhis lust, or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich cbarity. This was, however, attrihuted by him to thegreater importunity of lhe vicious, which general1y prevails over the retiring basbfuInefs of lhe virtuous indigent. Thero was one circuinstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mjnd: alI thase upon whom it was bestowed, inovitably found tbat there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to tbe lowest and the mosl abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through wbich lhey passed, Au6rey was surprized at the clpparenteagerness wilh which his companion sought for the centres of all fashioriable vice; there he entered into all the fpirit of thc faro table: he bett-\ned, and always gambled wilh sucoe\u017f\u017f, except where the known sharper was his anlagonist, and lhen he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he gonerally watched the societyar0und: it was not, however, so when he ericountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous s amlly; thon bis very wjsh seemed fortune's law\u2014thi\u017fapparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with inore fire than thot af the cat whilst dallying with the half-deod mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluont youth, lorn from the circle headorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate thclt had drown him wit hin the reach of this fiend; whilst many a sather sot frantic, amidst the speaking 1ooks of mute hungry children, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner os many, the last gilder he hcld just snatched from thc convulsive g rasp os the innocent: this might but be tbe result of a certain degree of knowledge, whjch was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey oftcn wished to reprefent this to his frlerid, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved therujn of oll, and did not tend lo his own profit;\u2014bul he delayed it\u2014sor each day he hoped his friend would give bim some opportunity os speaking frankly and oponly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his earriage, and amidst the vclrious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye sp0ke less than his lip; clnd though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gralification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myste ry, which to his exolted imaglnation began to assume the appeararice of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, clnd Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he loft him in daily attendance upon thc morning oircle of an Italian countess, whilft he went in search of the memorials of another almoft deserted city. WhiIst be was thus engclged, letters arrived srom England, w hich he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection;the others were fr0m his gvardians, thc latter astonished him; if it had bef0re entered into his imagination that there was an evll power residonl in his companian, these seemed to give him suffjcient reafon for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately lcaving his frierid, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the passession af irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habitsmore dangerous to society. It had been discavered, thal his contempt for the adu1tress had nol originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to erihance his gratificotiori, that his victjm, the partner os his guill, should be hurled from the piririacle of unsullied uirtue, down to the lowest abyss af insamy and degradation: in fine, that all thase females whom he had fought, apparentIy on clccovnl of their virtuc, had, since hls departure, thrown even thc mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposethe whole deformity of lheir uices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon loa ving one, wbose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plavsible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in lhe mean while, to watch him more clofely, and to lot no slight circumstances poss by vnnoticed. He entered jnto the same circlc, and soon perceived, that his Lordship wos endoavouring to work upon tbe inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Ital y, it is seldom tbat cln unrnorried female is inet wilh in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in clll his windings, and soon di\u017feoverod that an assignation had heen appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment af Lord Ruthvcn, ond abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, lnforming him at the fame time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthveri anfwered, that his intentions were such af he suppased all would have vpon such an occafion; arid upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying hif Lordship in the remainder of theirproposed tour, hc ordered his servant to seek other clpartments, arid calling upon tho mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only witb regard to ber daughler, but alsa concernirig the character of his Lordship. The a\u017fslgnation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his soruant lo notify hls complete clssent to aseparation; but did not hint any \u017fuspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left R0mc, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crosfing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residcnce in tho house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the saded records of ancienl gIory upon monument\u017f that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden lhemselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured licheri. Urider the same roof as himself, existed a being, fo beautisul clnd dclicate, lhat she might have sormed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on eanvass the promised h0pe of the faithful iri Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyos spoke too much mind for any one lo think she could belong to lhose who had no souls. As she dariced upon lhe plain, or tripped al0ng the mountain'fside, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; sar who would havo exchanged her eye, appareritly tbe eye of animated naluro,for that sleepy luxurious look os the ariimal sujted but to the tasle os an epicure. The lighl step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey iri his search after antiquities, arid often would the uncori\u017fcious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a K ashmerc butterfly, show the wh0le beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagcr gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had jusl decyphered upon an almosl effaced tablet, in the oontemplation of ber sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses fa1ling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun'\u017f ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fadirig hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very objoct he had before thought of vita1 importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreelate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-ro0ms ond ftifling balls. Whilst he drew tbose remains of which he wisbed to preserue a memorial f0r his future hours, she wouId starid by, and watch the magic cffects of bis pericil, in tracing the scenes 0f her native place; she would then describe to hlm the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hirn ln all the glowing colours of yaulbful memory, the marriage poinp sbe remembered viewing in her infaney; and then, turning to subjects that had cvidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talos of her nurse. Her earncstness and appare nt belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even af Aubrey; arid oflen as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frie nds, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fema1e to prolong his exiftence for the ensuing months, his blood would ruri cold, whilst he atternpted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe cited to him the nomes of old men, who had at last delected one living among tbem\u017felves, after several of their near rclatives and ehildren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend'f appetite; and whcn she found him so ineredulous, she begged of him lo believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question thejr existence, always hodsome proos giveri, wbich obliged them, wlth grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him tbe traditional appearance of the se monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rutbven; he, however, still per\u017fisled in persuading her, that tbere could be no trulh in her fear\u017f, th0ugh at tbe fame time he wondered clt the many coincidences wbich had all tended to excite a belief in tbe superncltural power of Lard Ruthven.\nAubrey beg an to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted wlth al1 the affected vlrtues of the women among whom he had sought for hls vision of romarice, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea af a y0ung man 0f English habils, marrying an uneducatedGreek girl, still he sound himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself clt times from her, and, forming a plan for some anliquarian researcb, he would depart, determined not to return vntil his objcct was attajned; but he always found it impossiblc to fix his attention upon the ruins araund him, whilst in his mind he retained ari image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his l0ve, and was ever thc sclme frank infantile being he had first known. She cllways seerned to part from hjm with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketchjng or uncovering some fragrnont wbich had yet escaped the destructjve band of timc. She had appealed to her parents on lhe subject of Vampyres, and they both, with soveral present, offirmed their existenoe, pale with horror at the very naine. Soan after, Aubrey determlned to proceed upan ane of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him n0t to relurn at night, as he must necessarily pclss through a wo0d, where rio Greek would ever rernairi, after tbe day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vompyres in their nocturnal orgios, and denoun-\nced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cr oss tbeir path. Aubrey made light of their represenlations, and tried ta laugh them oul of the idea; but when he saw tbem shudder at hi\u017f daring thus t0 mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparentIy made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext m0rnirig Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatterided; he was surprised to ob\u017ferve the melancholy face of his host, and wos concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of th0se horrible fiends, hcld lnsplred them with such terror. When bo was ab0ut to depart, Iaritbe came to the side of his h0rse, and carnestly begged os him to return, ere night allowcd the power os these being\u017f to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that dcly-light would foon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks whioh, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gatber into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon thc devoted eountry.\u2014He at last, howevcr, mounted his horse, determlned to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilighl, in lhese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its ochoing thunderf had scarcoly an intorval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rojn forced its way through tho canopying foliage, whilst tbe blve forked lightnirig seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Svddcnly his horfe took fright, and he wa\u017f carried with dreadful rapidity throvgh the critangled f0re\u017ft. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of ljghtning, that he was in tbe neighbourbood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood whicb surrovnded it. Dismounting, he approaehed, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter fr0m the pelling of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear tbe dreadful shrieks of cl woman mjngling with lhe stifled, exultarit mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uribroken sound;\u2014he was slartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his hcad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He sound himself in utter darkness: thc fo und, bowever, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds c ontlnued, and no n0tice wos taken of bim. He found hiinself iri eontact with some one, whom he immediatoly seized; when a voice cried, \"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he seIt himself grappled by one whose strenglh seomcd superhuman: determiried to sell his 1ife as dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was in valn: he was llfted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his onemy threw himself upori him, and kneeling upon his breast, bad placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glarc of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave ljght in the day, disturbed him;\u2014 hc instantly rose, and, leaving his prey,rushed through the door, and in amoment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through tbe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now stil l; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light 0f their torches fcll upan the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the dcsire of Aubrey they \u017fearched sor her who had attracted him by her crics; he was agajn Iefl in darkness; but what was his h0rror, when the light 0f the torches onoe more burst vpon hirn, to perceive theairy sorm of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a uision arising froin hj\u017f disturbed imaginatlon; but he again saw lhe saine forin, when he vnclosed them, stretched 6y his side. Tbere was no colovr upan her cheek, n0t oven upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her faco that seemed almost as attaching as lhe ljfe that onee dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breasl was blood, and upon her throat were thc marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vclmpyre! a Vampyre!\" A litler was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the side of her who had lotely been ta him the object of so mariy brightand fairy visioris, now falleri wjth the flawer of lise lhat had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemod to sbun reflection, and take resuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different partjes who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentablecries, a\u017f they approached thc clty, forewarned the parents of some dreadful ccltastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief w0uld be impossible; but when thcy ascerlained the causc of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolahle; both died broken-hcarted.\nAubrey bejng put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable cambiriation he soemed to beg of his former companion to spclre the being he loved. At 0ther times he would imprecate maledietian\u017f upon his head, and curse him cls her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanccd at this tirne to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, vpon heclring of the state of Aubrey, immcdiately ploced himsolf in the same hou\u017fe, and 6ccame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from bi\u017f delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now cambined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rulhvcn, by his kind words, implying almoft repentance far tho fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the atlerition, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconclled him to hls presence. His lordshjp seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared thot apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as bi\u017f c0nvalesconce began t0 bc rapid, he again gradvally retjred into the fame state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived rio difference from the former inan, except lbat clt times he wassurprised to meet his gaze fixed lntently upon him, wlth a smjle of malicious exultation p1aying upon his lips: he knew not why, but lhis smile haunted him. During the laststage of the inval id's recovery, Lord Rvthven was appclrently engaged in watching the tldeless waves raiscd by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to av0id the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, was much weakened, clnd thclt elasticity of spirit whicb had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a l0ver of solitude arid \u017filence as Lord Ruthven; but mueh as he wished for solltude, hls mind could not fjnd it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst tbe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianlhe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her Ilght step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of tbe modest violet; then su ddenly turnirig rovnd, would show, ta his wild imogination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determjned lo fly \u017fcenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mjnd. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom be held himself bound by tho tender core he had taken of him during hls i1lriess, thclt thoy should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every \u017fpot to which a recollection oould be attached: but though they thus hasteried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mueh of robbers, but they gradually hegan to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention os individuols, whose interest it was lo excite tbe generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangors. Iri consequence of thus neglectlng the advice of the inhabitantf, on ane occasion they travelled with orily a few guards, morc to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of whlch was lhe bed of a torrent, with lorge masses os rock brought dawri from the neighhouring precipices, they had reason to reperit thejr negligence; for scarcely wero the who1e of the parly erigaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of sevcral gvris. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing thcmselves behind rocks, had beguri to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthvon ond Auhrey, imitating lhejr example, retired for a momenl behind the shcItering turri of tbe defile: but ashamed of being lbuf detained by a foe, who with jnsulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposcd lo unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search 0f the eriemy. HardIy had they lost lhe shelter of lhe rock, when Lord Ruthven received cl shot in the shou1der, which broughl hiin to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assi\u017ftance; and, na langer hceding tbe contest or his own pcril, was saon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces orou nd him\u2014his guards havi ng, upon Lord Rulbven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises os great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he wos no more disturbed by their presence\u2014tbey being cantent merely to guard the entrance tilI thelr comrado sbould retvrn with the promised sum, far which he had an orde r. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days morlifieation ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct ond appearance had not changcd; he seemed as unconscious 0s pain os hc had been of the objects about bim: bul t0wards the close of the last evening, his mind became clpparontly urieasy, arid his eyc aften sixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance witb more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you rnay save me\u2014you may do more than thclt\u2014I mean not my life, I hced the death of my existencc as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's horiour.\"\u2014\"How? tell mohow? I would do any tbing,\" rcplied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my lifeehbs apace\u2014I cannot explain thewhole\u2014but if you would conceal all yov know os me, my hon0ur were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if iny death were unknawn for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but Iife.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swoar!\" crjed the dying man, raising himself with exullant violenee,\"Swear by all your \u017foul revere s, by all yovr natvre fears, swear that, for a year and a day you wil1 not impart your kriowledge of my crimes or death to ariy living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatcvor you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bu rsting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey relired to rest, but did not sleep; lhe many circumftonces attending his acquajntance with this man ro\u017fe upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he reinembered his oath a cold shiuering came over him, as jf from the presentiinent of something horrible awaitirig him. Rlsing early in the marnirig, he was abaut to enter the hovel in whioh he had left thocorpfe, when a rabber met him, and irifarmed hlm that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by bimself and comrades, vpon his retiring,to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a pr0mise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first c0ld ray of tbe moon lhat rose after his death. Avbroy astonished, and takirig several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the svmmit he found no trace 0f either the eorpse or the cl0thes, though the robber\u017f swore they pointed oul the identical rock on whicb they had lajd the body. For a time his mirid was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last retumed, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sclke of the clothes.\nWcary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortune\u017f, and in which all apparently eanspired t0 beighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, clnd soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had wilh hiin belongjng to Lord Ruthuen. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weaporis of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the vlctim. There were several daggers and alagharis. Whilst turning thom over, and exarnining their ourious forms, what was hif furprise at finding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the \u017fame style as the dagger discovered in the fcltal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening ta gain further proof, be found the weapon, and his horror may bc imagiried when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held iri his harid. His eyes secmed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were conccrning the ladyhe had attempted to snatch from L0rd Ruthvcn's seductive arts. Her parents were in distros\u017f, their fortune ruined, and she had not been hea rd of sincethe departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim t0 tbe destrayer of Ianthe. He b ecarne morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted iri ur ging the speod of thepostilions, asif he were going to save thc life of some onc he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, whlch feemed obedient to his will, soon waftcd hiin to the English shores; and he hastened to tbe mansion of his fathors, and there, sor a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraccs ond cclresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she beforo, by her infaritine earesses, had gained his afsection, naw tbat the woman began to appcar, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of tbe drawing-roorn a\u017fsemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists ln the heated atmasphere of a crowded apartment.Her 6lue eye was never 1it up by the levity af the mind beneath. Therewas a melancholy charm about it which did nat seem to arise from misforlvne, but from some feeling within, that appeared t0 indlcate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which slrays where'er a butterfly or a colovr may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affcctiori, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for thal of the voIuptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only cighteen, and had not been presenled to the worId, it having boen thought by her guardians more fit thal her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her proteclor. It was now, tberefore, resolved that tbe next drawjng-r0om, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey wovld rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upori the melancholy which ovc-\nrpowered him. He could not seel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when bis mind hcld beon so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the ncxt day, which hcld been announced as a drawjrig-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, clnd all who were arixious to bask in tho smilc of royalty, haftenod thith-\ner. Aubrey was lhere with his sjsler. Whilo he was ftandirig in a corner by himself, hcedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance tbal the first time he had feen Lard Rvthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by tbe orm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oclth.\" He had hard1y courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre thclt would hlast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had atlracted his notice on this spot up0n his first entry into society. He gazed till hislimbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he wos obliged to take lhe arm of a friend, andforcing a passage through the crowd, hc threw himself irito hif carriage, and was driven home. Ho paced the room with hurricd steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he wore afraid his thoughts were bursting from hjs brain. Lord Ruthveri agclin before him\u2014circumstances st arted up in dreadsul array\u2014tho dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He raused hiinself, he could not beljeve it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagincltion had conjured up the image his mjnd was resting upon. Il was impossiblc tbat il oould 6e roal\u2014he dotermiried, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthvon, the name hvng upon his lips, and he could riot succeed in gaining information. He went a few nlghts after with hi\u017f sister ta the clssembly of cl near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, clnd there gave himself up to his 0wn devovring lhoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and entering onother room, found his sister surrounded by soveral, apparently in earnest conversation; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, whom be requested tomove, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards tho street: at the door hesound hiinfelf impeded 6y tbe crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while hewas engaged jn passing tbern, he agaln heclrd that v0ice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"-\n\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his \u017fister, \u017foon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed hy one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upari his thovghts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, arid it was in vain that she intreated him to exploin ta ber what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only ultered a few word\u017f, arid those terrified hor. The more he thovght, the more he was bewildered. His 0ath slartled biin;\u2014waf he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, a midst oIl be held dear, and not auert its progress? His uery sisler might havo been touched by him. But even if be were to break his oath, arid djscl0se his suspicions, who wouId believe him? Hethought of emp1oying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, hc remembered, had been already mocked. For days he reinained in this state; shut up in his roam, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support nclture. At last, no longer capable of bearing stj1lness and solitude, he left his hau\u017fe, r0amed from street to street, anxious to fly that image wbich haunted him. His dress became neg1ected, and be wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun clf to the midnlghl damps. Hewas no longer to berecogni2ed; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to resl wherever fatigue 0vertook him. His sister, anxiou\u017f for his safety, employed people lo follow hiin; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. Hi\u017f conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with lhe idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend arnongst them, of whose presence they werc unconscious, he determined to enter clgain jnlo fociety,and wotch him cIosely, anxious to forewarn, in \u017fpite of hjs oath, all whom Lord Ruthven clpproached witb intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspioious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sisler was clt last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, sor her sake, a society which affectedhim so strongly. When, howcuer, remonstrance proved uriavailing, the guardians tbought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mjnd was becoming alienated, they thought it high tlme to resume again that trust which hod been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parerits.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he hod daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing bim from exposingto the gen era1 eye those marks of what lhey considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in lhe housc, and take constant care of him. He hardly appearod to notice it, so c0mpletoly was his mind ab\u017forbed by one terrible su6ject. Hi\u017f ineoherence became cll last so greal, tbat he was canfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapabIe of boing rous ed. He had became emaciated, his cyes had attaincd a glassy 1ustre;\u2014the onlysign of affectjon and reeolleotion reinaining displayed itself upon tbe entry os his sister; then ho wovld sometjmes start, and, seizing her hands, with laoks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her riot to toucb him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014lf your love for me is aught, do n0l go near him!\" When, howevcr, she inquired lo whom he referred, his onIy answer was, \"Trve! true!\" and againhe sank into a state, whonce not even fhe could rouse him. This lasted many monlhs: gradually, howeuer, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and hls mind threw off aportlon 0f its gloom, whilst his guardlans observed, that several times in thc day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tirne bad nearly elapsed, when, upon lhe last day of the year, ane of his guardians entering his room, began toconversc with his physician upon the melancholy circum\u017ftance of Aubrey's bejng in so owfvl cl situotion, when his sister was going next day to 6e mclrried. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attraeled; ho asked anxiausly to whom. Glad of tbis mark of returning intellect, of which they seared he had been deprived, lhey inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a yovng Earl whom he had met with in fociety, Aubrey seomed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to seehis sister. They answered not, but in a few miriutes his sister waf with him. He was apparently again eapable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, arid klssed her cheek, wet with te ars, flawing at the thought os her brothor's being oncc more alive to the feellngs of affectian. He began to speak with al1 his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accoinplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockel upon her broast; opening it, what was his surprise ot beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his lifc. He soized the portralt in a paroxysm af rage, and trainpled it under foot. Upan her afking him why he thus destroyed the resemblonce of her future husband, ho looked as if he did riot uriderstand her\u2014tben seizing hor hand\u017f, and gozing on her with a frantic expressionof cavntenanee, he bade her swear that she wauld never wed this mansler, for he\u2014 But hc cauld not advance\u2014it seemed as if thal voice clgain bade bim remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly roun d, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him 6ul saw no ane. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thaught thjs was but a return of his disorder, entered,arid forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her t0 leavehim. He feIl upon his kriees to lhem, he implored, he bogged of them to de1ay but for one day. They, attribvting this to the insanity they imagined had tclken possession of hi\u017f mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retjred.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming after tbe drawing-room, and had been rofused with every one clse. When he heard of Avbrey's ill hoalth, he readily understood himself to be the cause os jt; but wben he learned that he was deemed irisane, his exultcltion and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those ornong whorn he had goiried thls information. He hastened to the bouse of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence af great affectian for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the oar of Mifs Avbrey. Who could resisl his power? His tongue had dangers and tails lo recount\u2014could speak of bimseIf as 0f an lndividual having no sympathy with any bcing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, siricc he knew her, his exjstence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation,if it were merely that he might lislen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to vse the serpent's ort, or such was the wilI of fate, that he gained her affectlons. The title of lhe el der branch falling ot length to bim, hc oblained an important embassy, which served as cln excuse sor hastening the rnarriage, (in spite of her 6rothor's derangedstate,) which was t0 take place the very day besore bis departure for tbe continent.\nAubrey, when ho was left by the physician and hjs guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and papor; it was gjven him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjurlng her, as she valuod her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour af those now in tho grave, who once beld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their bouse, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, onwhich he denounced the m0\u017ft heavy ourses. The servants promised they would deliver it; hut giving it to the phy\u017fician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on withovt rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a h0rror that may more easily be conceived than describod, the notes of busy prepclration. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame lbeir vigilance, they gradually st0le away, leaving him in the cvstody of an belpless old woman. Ho seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the apartrnent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he lmmediately approached, and, taking hif arm by force, hurried him from the room, speecbless with roge. When on thc staircase, Lord Rut-\nhven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not rny bride to day, your sister is dishonourcd. Women are frajl!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused bythe old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, clnd he wa\u017f conveyed to bed. This wa\u017f not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marrjage was solemni2ed, and the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; thc effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach os death. He dosired his sister's guardians migbt be callod, and when the midnight hour had struck, ho related composedly what the reader haf perused\u2014he dicd immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Au6rey; hvt when they arriv-\n cd, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND 0F MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wa\u017f all before him, where to choose his place of rest,and Providence hls guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelclgo, on board one of his Majesly's vessels, in thc year1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the islond of that name. The beauty of thi\u017f place, and the certain svpply of eclttle and vegetoblef always to be had there, i nduee many British vessel\u017f to vi\u017fit it\u2014botb men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather oul of the track for ships bound to Sinyrna, its b0unties amply repay f0r lhe deviation of a voyoge. We landed; as usucll, at the bottom of the 6ay, and whilst the mcri were employed in watering, and lhe purser bargclinjng for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other pIaces, where we had been before. Dn the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so nclmed) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who toId us he bad comc from Scio with an English lord, wha left the island four days prcvious to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said theGreek, \"and would have takeri mc with him; but I did not choofe to quit Mltylene, where I am likcly to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The coltage over the hill, facing the river, belongs t0 him, arid ho has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six huridred zochines for it, (about L250 Englisb currenoy,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the disferent islands.\"\nThis account excited aur curiosity very much, and we loft no time in hastening to tbe houfe where our countryman had residcd. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments ori the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting par lour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closct annexed. They were clll simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, alarge myrtle in the centre, clnd a smaIl fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branchcs by moving a spring fixed iri the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poslure; a large couch or sofa completedthe furniture. In the hall stood half a dozcn English eane chclirs, and an empty book-case: lhere were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber hadmercly a large mattress spread an the floor, with two stusfed cotton qvilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-roorn wo observed a marble recoss, formerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamari's cbest in lhe closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. On the tablot of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shclkspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the Gerrnan language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's nove1s; Schiller's pIay of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; sevcral sma1l pamph1ets from the Greek press at Constantinople, mvcb lorn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written witha penoil, in Ilalian and Latin. Tbe Messiah was literally soribbled all 0ver, and inarked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old inan said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withovt o rders, he would frown upon me for a week tagether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking careof it, except twenty zechines which I poy to an agod Armenian who resides in cl small cottage in the wood, and wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nTho appeararice of the house externally was pleafing. Thc portioo in f ront was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted inarble pillars with black plinths clnd fret-work corriices, (as it is now customary in Grecian arcbitecture,) were considerably hjgher than tho roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone baluftrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are lhus furnished, as upon them the Grecks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christl,\" eating sruit, and enioyirig the evening breeze.\nOn the lefl hand as we entered the hovse, a small streamlel glided away, grapes, oranges and llmes were oIustering together on its horders, and under the shade os two large myrtle bushes, a mar6le seat with ari ornamentaI wooden back was placed, ori wbich we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'elock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was uery devout, \"orid always clttended our churoh twice a week, besides Suridays.\"\nThe view from tbis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, coverod with 0live ond myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an anoient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descerided in broken cascades, until it was lost in lhe woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horjzori unshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in front; and a litt1e on the left, thraugb a vista of lafty chesnut and palm-lrees, several small islands werc distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave wilh spots of emerald green. I soldom enjoycd a view rnore than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitIess as to the name of the person who hod re\u017fided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said ourconductor, \"c0uld tcll, butI am sure be wllI not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, ald friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I cari,\" saidhe, \"I dare not.\" We bad not time to uisit the Arinenian, but on our return ta tho lowri we learntseveral particulars of the isolated lor d. He had portioned eight young girl\u017f when he was lasl upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses lo olhers, and cotton and siIk to the girls who live by weauing these articles. He also baugbl a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testament\u017f to the poor children. In short, he clppeared to us, from aIl we collected, to have been a very eccentricand berievolent charclcter. One circumslance we learnt, which our old frjend at the cottage thought proper not to discl0se. He had a most beautisul daughler, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had baughl her a piano-forto, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information witb which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylerie; our iinaglnations all on the rclck, gues\u017fing who this rambler in Greece could be. Ho hcld money it was evidenl: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geriius. Arrived at Palermo, alI our dou6ts were dispelled. Falling in company wjth Mr. FOSTER, tbe architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had 6een travellirig in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"abovt whom you are \u017fo anxiaus, is Lard Byrori; I mcl him in my travelf on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had ncver then heard af his l0rdship's fame, as we had been some years fr0m home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hclnds we recognized the recluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been moro curiaus jn our researcbes at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idoa of returnjng to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me that day wlll neuer returri. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good riame, whicb has been grossly sla ndcred. He has been described as of an unfceling dlspasjtion, averse to associating with human nature, or contrj6utlng in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to jts pleasvres. The fact ls direotly the roverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the sirier feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordsbip's poems, seein to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatby, and oharity appear to guide all his actions: clnd his courting tho repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religi0n hath set her \u017feal, and overwhose hoad Beneuolence hath throwri her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasjng \"trait\u017f\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasvrcs, I do not assumea rlght ta glvc an opinion. Reports are ever to be reeeived with caution, particulorly when direoted against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where allmu\u017ft appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is lhe surest testimony of a virtuous beart orid \u017felf-approving conscierice.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-covrt, Fleet-street.","22":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this lale is fovnded is very gerieral iri the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be oommon: it did riot, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and il has on1y assumed its presentfarm sinoe the divlsion of thc Latin ond Greck chvrches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body eould not corrupt if 6urjed in their tcrritary, it graduaIly increased, and formed the subj ect of many wonderful \u017ftorles, still extant, of the dead rising from tbeir graues, and feeding upon the blood of tbe young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variotion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where thc belief exis ted, lhat vampyres nightIy imbibed a certain portion of the b1ood of thejr victims, who bccame emaci ated, lost their streng-\nth, and specdily died of consumpti0ns; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins beoame distended to sueh a state of repletion, as to ccluse tbe blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of thelr skinf.\nIn the Londori JournaI, of March, 1732, is o curious, and, of course, credible occount of a particular case af vclmpyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngary. It appears, that up0n an examination of the commarider-in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they po\u017fitively and unaniinously affirmod, that, about sive years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hcard to say, that, ot Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had fovnd a way to rid bimself of lhe ovil, by eating some ofthe earth out of the vclmpyre's grave, clnd rubbing himselswjth his blood. This precaution, howevcr, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himse1f; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition waf made, that four persons had been deprived af life by his attacks. To prevent further misehief, the jnhabitarits having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f0und it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free srom corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtalned, they resorted to the accuslomcd remedy. A stake was driven entlrely through the heart clnd body of Arnold Paul, at wbich he is reported to have cried ovt os dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut ofs bis head, burned his body, and threw thc ashes into his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corsef of lhose persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they sbould, in their turn, become agerits upan others who survived them.\nThe uniuersal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyro becomcs a uampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThismonstrous rodomontade is here relatcd, because it seems betler adapted to lllustrate the subject as the presont observations than any other inslance which could be adduccd. In many parts of Greece it iscansidered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime c0mmitted whilst lri exi\u017ftence, that the deceased is not only doomed lo vampyrise, but compelled lo confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loued most whi1e upon earth\u2014those to whom he was baund by tief of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBvt first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt thenative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Therefrom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streclm of life; Yet loathe the bariquet whjch perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know lhedemon for lbeir sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that sor thy crime must soll, Tbe yovngest, best beloved of all,Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That ward shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thov musl end thy task and mark Her cheek's last lingc\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw Which freezes o'er its life1oss blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellowhair, Of which, in life cl lock when shorn Affection'ffondest pledge wcl\u017f worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of tbine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then \u017ftalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sbrink awoy From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. S0uthoy has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalabo,\"tbe vampyre c0rse of the Arabianmaid Oneizo, who is represented as having rcturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best l0vedwhilst in existenee. But this c annot be supposed to have resulted from the sjnfulness of her life, she belng pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type ofpurity and innoccncc. The voracious Tournefort glves a long account in his travels of several aftonishing case\u017f of vampyrism, to whieh he pretend\u017f to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, bas pul sorth some learned dissertations, teridirig to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany ouriaus and inleresting notices on thif singular1y horrible superstition might be added; though the prefentmay sufflce for tbe limits os a riote, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with il, made use of in variovs parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, VardouIacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the mjdst os the dissipalions attendclnt upon a Lo ndon winler, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularlties, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirlh oround hiin, as if hc could not participatc therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracled his altention, that he mjght by a Iook quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thougbt1essriess reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awe, couldnot explain whence it arose: somo clttributed it to lhe dead grey eye, which, fixing upontbe object'f face, did not seem to penelrate, and at 0ne glance to pierce thr0ugh to the inward working\u017f of the heart; but fell upon the check with o leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be irivited lo every hovse; a1l wished to see him, and those who had bcon accustorned to vjolent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were plea\u017fed at hauing somethlng in their presence capable of engaging their atterition. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whlch riever gained a warmcr tint, either from the blufh of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mclny of the female hunters after noloriety attempted to win his atlentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn iri drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw berself iri his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to atlract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she \u017ftood before hlm, though his eyes were apparentIy sixed upon her's, stil1 it seemed as if they were unporceived;\u2014even her unoppal1ed impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common aduItress oould not influence even the guidance af his eyes, it was n0t lhat the female sox was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent c aution with which be spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, tbclt few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He hcld, however, the reputation of a winnirig tongue; and whethcr it wcls that it even overcame the dread of his siriguIar character, or that thcy were moved 6y his apparent bcltred of vice, he was as often among those fema1es who form the boast of their sex from their domeslie virtues, as am0ng those who sully it by lheir vices.\nAbout the sclme time, there carne to London o young gentleman of tho name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possessjon of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardianf, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importanl charge of his mind to the care ofmeroenary subalterris, he cultivated more bis imagincltion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic seeljng of honour and cand0ur, which dajly ruins s0 many milliners' apprcntices. He believed all lo sympathisc with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence mere1y for the picturesque esfect of the scene, as we see in romances: hc tboughl thclt the misery of a cottage merely consisled in the vosting of clothes, which were as warm, but which werc better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured palches. He lhought, in fine, that lho dreams of poets were the roalities of life. He was hondsome, fronk, and rich: sor these rea\u017f0nf, upon his enlering irito the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which sbovld describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenancos when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his 1ips, soon led him into folse notjons of bis ta1ents and his merit. Attached as he waf t0 the romance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at findirig, that, except in the tallow and wax eandles that fliekered, not from lhe presonce of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in recl1 life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes,from which he had formed his study. Finding, however,sorne coinpenfalion in his gratjfied vanity, he was clbout to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in bis career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea as the character of a mcln entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other \u017figns of hi\u017f observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by tho avoidance of their c0ntact: aIlowing his imaginotion to picture euery thing that flattered ils propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his sancy, rather than the person heforehim. He became acquaintod with hjm, paid him attenlions, and fo far advanced upori his notloe, that his prcsence waf a1ways rec0gnifed. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrafsed, and soon faund, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was abovt to travel. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting thls singular character, who, lill now, had only wbetted his curiosity, he hintcd to his guardians, that it was time far him to perform the tou r, which for many generations has been thought neccssclry to enablethe young to lake some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards putting themselvcs upon an equality with the aged, and not allawing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subiects of pleasantry or 0f praise, aecarding to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: ond Aubrey immediately mentloning bis intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to reccive from hirn a proposal to join him. FIattered by such a mark os esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in comm0ri with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity as studying Lord Ruthven'\u017f character, and now he found, that, though many more of hi\u017f actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different eonclusioris from the apparent motives to his conducl. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reccived from hls harid more than enough torelieve lheir immediate wants. But Aubrey could n0t av0id remarking, that it waf not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant cvenupon virtue, that he be\u017flowed his alrns;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer\u017f; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him ta wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he waf sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the viclous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtu0us ind-\nigont. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found lhat thcro was a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the \u017fcaffold, or sunkto the lowest and the most ahject misery.At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avbrey was surprized at the apparent eagerne\u017fs with wbich his c0mpanion sought for tho centres of all fashionable vjce; there he eritered into al1 tbe splrit of thc faro table: he betled, and always gambled with success, cxcept where the known sharper wos his antagonisl, and then he lost even rnore than he gained; but it was cllways with the same unchanging face, with which be goneral1y watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthfvl riovice, or the lucklesf fathcr of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed forturie's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire thanlhat os the cat whllst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, ho left the formcrly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of cl dungeon, the fate that hcld drawn him within the reach af this fiend; whilst many a father sat frclntie, amidsl the speaking looks of mute hungry chi1dren, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith lo buy even susficient to satisfy lhoir prcsent craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tab1e; but immediately losl, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder be had just snatched from the coriuvlsive grasp of the innocent: this mighl but bethe result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienccd. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his fri-\nend, and beg him to resign thot charity and pleasure which proved tbe ruin of all, and did not tend to hls own profit;\u2014but he delayod it\u2014foreach day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openIy to him; however, tbi\u017f neuer occurred. Lord Ru thven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and ricb scenef of nature, wcls aIwaysthe same: his eye \u017fpake less than hjs lip; ond thovgh Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtaincd no greater gratification from it than the constant excltement of vain1y wishing to hreclk thal myslery, which to hi\u017f exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of somethlng superriatural.\nThoy soon arrjved at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left hjm in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Itallan c0untess, whilst be went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted eity. Wbilst he was thvs engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affectiori; theothers were frorn hif guardians, the latter ostonished him; if it had 6eforo entered irito his lmagjnation that there was an evil power residenl in his companion, these seemcd to giue him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediatcly leaving hi\u017f friend, and urged, that hjs character was dreadfully viciaus, for that the posse ssion of irresistible powcrs of seduction, rendered his liccntious habils more dclngerous to society. It had been difcovered, that his contempt f0r lhe adultrcss had not originated in hcltred of her character; but that he had required, to onhance his gratification, thal bif uictim, lhe partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unfullied virlue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatjon: in fine, that cllI those females whom he had sought, apparently on a ccount of their virtue, hod, since hls departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whoIe deforrnity of their vicos to lhe public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose characterhad not yet shown a single hright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved t0 invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pvrposing, jn the mean while, to watch him moro closely, and ta let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He enlered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring lo work upon the jnexperionce of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly freqvented. In Ilaly, it is seldom that an urimarried semale is met with in socioty; he was thereforo abliged to carry on his plans insecrot; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discouered thal an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in tbe ruin of an inriocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered lhe apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly askedhim hi\u017f intenlions with rospect to tbe lady, informing him at the same time that hc was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that hls intentions weresuch as he supposed allwould have upon svch an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry ber, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, jmmedicltely writing a note, to say, that from thal moment he must declirie accompanying his Lordsbip in the remainder of their proposed tour, he orderedhis seruant to seek other apclrtinents, and ealling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he know, not only with regard to her daughter, bvt also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assjgnatjon was preuenled. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify hls complcte assenl to a \u017fcporation; bvt did not hint any suspiciori of his p1ans having heen foiled hy Aubrey's iriterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dlrectcd his steps towards Grecce, and crossing the Penirisula, soon found himself at Alhens. Hc then fixed his residence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upori monuments that opparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had biddon themselues benoath the sheltering soil 0r mony caloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful arid delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wlshing to pourtray on canvass lbe promised hope of the faithful iri Mahomet's parodise, save that her eye\u017f spoke too mvch mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upori the plain, or tripped cllong the mountain's sjde, one wouldhave tbought the gazelle a p0or type of ber beautles; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animaI suited but t0 tho taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in hjs search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursult of a Kashmere butterfly, show tbe whole beauly of ber form, floating as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot lhe letters he had just decyphered upon an olmost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tressef falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, itmight well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from hjs mlnd tbe very object he had beforc thought of vita1 importanoe to the proper lnterpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all seeI, but none ccln appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling 6alls. Whilst he drew lhose remains of wbich he wished to prescrve cl memorial for his future hourf, she would stand by, and walch the magic effects of his pericil, ln tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the ciroling dance upon the open plain, w0uld painl, to him in all tho glowing colour\u017f 0f youthful inemory, themarrlage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, tuming to subjects that had evidently madc a greater impresslon upon her mind, would tell hiin all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestriess and apparent belief of what she narraled, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sho taldhim thetale of the living vampyre, who hcld pasfed years amidst his friends, and doarest tics, forced euery year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fernale lo pro1ong his exi\u017ftence far the erisujng moriths, his blood would run oold, whilst he attempted t0 laugh her aut of such idle and horrible sclntasje\u017f; bvt Ianthe clted to hiin the names ofold mcn, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several 0f their near re1atives and children hod been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it hcld been, remarked, that those who had dared to queftion their existence, alw ays had \u017fome proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbrcaking, taconfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that thore could be no truth in her fears, tbough at the same time he wondered at the many c0incidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the svpernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her irinocence, so contrastod wjth all the affected virtues of the women among wh0m he had sought forhis vislonof romanco, won his heart; and while he ridiculed tbe idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an urieducated Greek girl, still he found himse1f more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear hiinse1f at times from hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, delermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found lt impossible to flx his attcntianupon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained on iinage that seemed alone tho rjghlfvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infaritile being he had first known. She a1ways scemed to part from him with reluctance; but jt was because she had no longer ariy one with whom she could visit her favouritc haunts, whilst herguardian was occupied in sketching or uncovcring some fragmont whioh had yet escoped tbe destructive hand of time. She had appealed lo her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed thejr existence, pale with horror al the very riame. Soon after, Avbrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, whjch wa\u017f to detairi him for a sew hours; when they beard the name of the p1ace, they all at once hegged of hiin n0t to return at night, as he must necessarily pa\u017fs througb a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort 0f the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the inost hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross thelr path. Aubrey made light os their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but wberi he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of whicb apparently made their blood freeze, he was silcnt.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observc the melanc holy facc of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, moekirig the belief of lhose horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When be was clbout to depart, Ianthe come to the side 0f his horse, and earriestly bogged of hlm to retvrn, ere nigbt allowcd the power os these beirig\u017f to be put in aclion;\u2014he pr0mised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks whioh, in tbe warmer climates, so rapidly gother into a tremendous mass, and pour a1l thcir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, howeuer, mounted his horse, deterinined t0 make up by speed for his delay: but il was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, i\u017f almost unkn0wri; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere hehad advanced far, the power of the storin was above\u2014itf echoing thunders had scareely an intervol of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilsl the bIue forked lightning seemed to fclll and radiate al his very feet. Svddenly his horse to0k fright, and be was carried with dreadfvl rapidity through thc entangled foresl. The animal at last, thr0ugh fatiguc, stopped, and he found, by lhe g1are of lightning, thal he was in tho nejghbourhood of a hovel that hardlylifted itself up fram the masses of dead leaves and brvfhwood whicb surrounded it. Dismounting, he clpproached, hoping to find some onc to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he appraached, the thunders, for a moment filent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mjngling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced opcn the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Hc was apparenlly unperceived; f0r, lhough he called, still the sounds coritinued, and no notice was taken 0f him. He found himself in coritactwith some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a volce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh sueceedcd; and be felt himself grappled by one whose ftrength seemed superhumari: determined to fell his life as dearly as he cou1d, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted fram his fcet and hurled with cnormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw bimself upon him, and krieelingupon bis breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torcbes penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, djsturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the d0ar, and ln a moment tbecrashing of the branchcs, as he broke through lhe wood, was no longer heard. The storrn was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon hoard by those without. They enlered; the light af their torches fell upon lhe mud walls, and the thatcb loaded on every individual straw with heavy flokes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; hc was again left in darkne\u017fs; but what was his horror, whon the light of the torches oncc more burst upon him, to perceive thc airy form of his fair condvctrcss brought in a lifeless corse. He shul hi\u017f eyes, hoping that jt was but a vision arising from his disturbed imaginatian; but he again saw the same form, when he vnclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness clhout hcr face that seemed alrnost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon hor neck and breast was bloo d, and vpon her throat were the marksof teeth having opened lhe vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her wbo had lateIy been to him the object of \u017fo many bright and fairy visjons, now fallen with the flower af life that had died wilhin her. He knew not what his thaughts were\u2014his mind was benvm6ed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vaoancy\u2014hc held almost uncansciously in his hand a naked dagger af a parlicvlar coristruction, which had beon foundin the hut. They were soon rnet by different parties who had been engaged jn the fearch os her whom a m0ther had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approachcd the cily, forewarned the parents of some dreadsul cataslrophe. \u2014To describe their grlef wovld be impossible; but when they asoertained the eause of their child's death, thoy looked ot Aubrey, and pointed to the corsc. Thoy were inconsolable; both died broken-hearled.\nAubrey being put to bed was sei2ed with a most uiolenl fever, and was often deliri0us; in these interva1s he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some uriaccountable combination he seemed to beg of hjs former companion to spa re thc being ho loved. At other times he would iinprecate maledicti0ns upon hjs head, ond curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athons, and, from whatcver motiue, upan hearing of thestate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and hecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the \u017fight of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impIying almost repentance for the fouIt tbat had cau\u017fed their separation, and still rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, so0n reconcilcd him to his presence. His lordship seemed qvite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wbo had so aslonished Aubrey; but as soon as hls conualescence began to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio difserencc froin the formor man, excepl thatat times be was surprised to meot bis gaze fixed intently upon him, with a sinile 0f malicious exultatian playing upon bis lips: he knew not why, but this \u017fmile haunted him. During the last stage os the irivalid's recavery,Lord Ruthven was appare ntly engaged in wcltching the tideless waves raised by lhe coollng breeze, or in marking lbe progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the inoveless sun;\u2014indeed, he oppeared ta wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's mirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat eIasticity of spirit which had once so distingvifhed him now \u017feemed to have sled for ever. He wclf now as much cl lover of soIitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it ln the neighbaurhood of Athens; if he sougbt it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iarithe's form stood by hls side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of tbe modcst violet; then sudde-\nnly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild lrnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined t0 fly scenef, every feature of which crea ted such bitter associatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom heheld himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during bjs illness, that they shovld visit those parts af Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled ln every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollectiori could be attached:but thovgb they thus hastened from place to place, yet lhey seemed riot ta heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually bcgan to slight these reports, whicb they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest lt was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with on1y a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dofenc e. Upon entering, however, clnarraw defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, wlth large inosses of rock brougbt down from the neigh6ouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for searcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whist1ing of bullets close totheir heads, ond by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant tbeir guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direclion whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating lheir example, retired for a in0ment behind tbe sheItering turn of the defile: bul ashamed of boing thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them aduance, and being cxposed to unresisting slaughter, if clny of the r0bbers should climb above arid take them in the reor, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly hod they losl tbe \u017fhelter of lhe rock, when Lord Ruthven recejved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy bastened to his assiftance; clnd, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was s0ori surprised by seeing the robbors' facesaround him\u2014his guards having, upori Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their orms and \u017furrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them t0 convey his wounded frierid to a neigh6ouring cabin; and having agreod upan a ransom, he waf no more difturbed by their presence\u2014they being content mere1y to guard tbe entrance till theircomrade should rctum witb the promised sum, for whjch he hcld an order. Lord Rutbven'f ftrerigth rapidly decreased; in lwo days inortificationensued, and death seemed advancing withhosty steps. His conduct and appearance had nol changed; he seemed as vnconsclous of pcliri as he had been of thc objects obout him: but towards the cl0se of the last evening, his mirid became apparently uneasy, and hls cye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestnesf\u2014\"Assjst me! you may save me\u2014y0u may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the dca tb of iny exi\u017ftence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save iny honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I nced but little\u2014my Iife ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain lhe whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in tbe world's mouth\u2014and is my death were unknown for somc time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014bvt life.\"\u2014\"It shalI not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisirig hlmfelf witb exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fears, swear that, for a yoar and a day you will not impart your knowledge of rny crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whalcver you may see. \"\u2014His eyes fecmed bursting froin their sackets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he surik laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did nat sleep; the mariy circumstances attcnding his acqvaintance with this man rose upori his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came aver him, as if from the presentiment of somelhing horrible awaiting bim. Rising early jn the mornirig, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, whcn a robber met hiin, and informed him lhat it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordshjp, that it should be exposed lo the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrcy astonished, and taking several of the men, deterrnined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when be had mounted lo the summit he fourid no tracc af either the corpse or the clothes, though tbo robbers s wore lhey polnted out the identical rock on which they had laid lhe bady. For a time his mirid was 6ewildered in conjectures, but he at lasl relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of cl country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighlen that superstitious melancholy thathad seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied him\u017felf in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case coritaining several weapons of offence, more or less adapted toensure the death of the uictim. Thcre were feueral daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining thcir curious forms, what wa\u017f his surprise at finding a sheath apparently omamented in the same style as the dagger discove red in the fatal hut\u2014hc shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered thot it sitted, thou gh peculiarly shaped, the shcath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were alsa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquirief were c0ncernjng the lady he hadattempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvon'f seductive arts. Her parcnts were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since thc departureof his lordship. Aubrcy's mind became almo\u017ft braken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this 1ady hod fallcn a victim to the destroyer af Ianthe. Hc beoame morose arid silent; and his only occupation oonsistedin urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some orie he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, s0on wafled bim to the Englisb shores; and he hostened to the mansion of his f athcrs, and there, for a moment, appearod to lose, in the embraces and carcfses of his sjsler, all memory of the post. If she before, by her infantinecaresses, hcld gained his affeclion, now tbat tho woman began to appear, she was ftill more attaohing as a c0mpanion.\nMiss Aubrey hcld not thal winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of thc drawing-room assemblies. There was none 0f that light brilliaricy which only exists in the hoated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy oharm aboul it which did not seem to arise from misfortunc, but from some fee1ing within, lhat appcared lo indicate a soul consciaus of a brighter realm. Her slep was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may altract\u2014it was sedate and pcrislve. When alone, her face was never brjghtened by the smiIe of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and wovld in her prefence forget those griofs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smilc for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playlng in the light of their own natjve sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not heen prescnted to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentaliori should be delayed until her brother's return from the conti-\nnent, when he might bo her protect0r. Il was n0w, therefore, resolvcd thal the next drawing-rooin, which was fast approaching, fhould be the epoch of her entry into the\"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in tbe mansion af his fatbers, and fed upon lhe melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel inlerest about the frivolitles of fashianable strangers, wheri his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to saeri fice bis own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, ond prepared f0r lhe riexl day, which had 6een announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held sor along time, and all who were anxious ta bask in the smiIe of royalty, hastoned thilhor. Aubrey was there with bis sister. While he was slanding in a corner by himself, heedIess of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the firfl time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he rec0gnized loo well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember yovr 0alh.\"He had hordly courage to turn, searful of feeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a liltle distanco, the same figure whicb had attracted his notice on this spot upon bis first entry into society. He gazed til1 hif limbs almost refuslng to 6ear thelr weight, he was obliged lo take tho arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through thecrowd, he threw himsclf into his carriage, and was driven home. Ho paced the room with hurriod steps, and fixed hi\u017f hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts werc bursting srom his brain. Lord Ruthven agaln bcfore him\u2014circumstances started vp in droadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014bis oclth.\u2014He roused hims eIf, he could not helieve it po\u017fsible\u2014the dead rise agaln!\u2014He thovghl his imagination had conjured up thc image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it couldbe rcal\u2014he dotermined, therofore, to go again into society; for though he attemptedla ask cancerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he eould not sueceed in gaining information. Hc went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relati0n. Leaving her under the protectian of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, lhat many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an0ther raom, found his sister surr0undod by sevoral, apparently in oarnest conversation; he attempted to pass clnd get near her, when ono, whom be requested to move, tumed round, and revealed to him those featuros he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried \u017ftep, farced hor tawards the street: al the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servclnts who were waitirig for their lords; clnd while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voico whisper close t0 him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAu6rey becamo almost dislracted. If befare his mind had been clbsor6ed by onc subject, bow much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's llving agaln pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler'sattentions were now uriheedod, and it was in uoin that she intreated him to explain to her whal had caused hi\u017f clbrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and thofe terrified her.The more he thought, the more ho was bewildered. His oath startled hlm;\u2014was he tben to allow thjs monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert jls progress? His very sister might have been touohed by him. But cven if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought os employing his own hand to free the world from such a wrelch; but death, he remembered, hod been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nclture. At last, no longer oapable of bearirig stillness and s0litudc,he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to flytbal image which haunted him. His drcss become noglected, and he wandered, as ofton exposed to the noon-\n-day sun as to the midnight damps.He was no l0nger to be reoognized; at first he returned with the evening to lhe havse; but at laslhe laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sistcr, anxious for his safety, omployed people to folIow bim; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pvrsuer swiftcr tban any\u2014from thought. His conducl, however, suddenly changed.Struck wilh the idea lhat he left by his abscnee the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose prefence they were uriconsci0us, he delermined to enter again into sooiety, ond watcb him clo\u017fely, anxlous lo forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven appr0ached withintimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and svspicious looks were so slriking, his iriward shudderings so uisible, that his sister was at last abljged to beg of him to abstairi from seeking, for her sake, a society whlch affected him so strongly. Wheri, howevcr, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought propor to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whicb had been before impofed upon themby Aubrcy's parents.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, clnd af preveriting him from exposing to the general eye those mark\u017f of what they c0nsidered folly, thcy engaged a physician to reside ln the house, ond lake constarit care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrlhle subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined lo his chamber. There be would often lje for days, irieapable of 6eing roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014lhe only sign of affoctiori and recollection remoiriing displayed ilself up0n the entry of his sister; then he wauld somelimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that se uere1y afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do nat touch hirn\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Wben, howevcr, sbe iriquired to whom he referrod, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even shecould rouse hjm. This lostod mclny manths: gradually, bowever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became lesf frequent, and his mind threw off a portlon of its gloom, whiIst his guardians observed, that several tlmes in the day he wauld count upon his fingers a definito riumber, and then smile.\nThe tlme had nearly clapsed, when, upon the last day of the ycar, onc of hisguardians entering his room, began to converse with bis physician upon the melanchoIy circumstance of Aubrey's being iri so awful a siluation, when his sister was going next day to be marrjed. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he osked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had beeri deprlved, they mcntioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thlnking this was a young Earl whom he hadmet wjth in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still morc by his expressing hi\u017f intention to be presenl at the nuptiols, and desiring to see his sister. They ariswored not, but in a sew minutes his sistcr waf with him. He was apparently again capabIe of being affected 6y the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought os her brother's heing onco more alive tothe feelirigs of affectlon. He bogan to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguishod f0r rank and cvery accomplishment;when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, whal was his surprise at beholding lhe features of the monster wbo had fo long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rogc, and trampled il under foot. Upon hor asking him why he thus deslroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic oxpression of counlenclnce, he bade hor swear that she wovld never wed this monster, for be\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice ogain bade him re member his oath\u2014he turned sudden1y round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but sclw n0 one. In the moantime the guardiclns and physioian, who had heclrd the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Mlss Aubrey, desired her to lcave hlm. He fell upon hif knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity tbcy imagined had taken possesfion 0s his mjnd, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning aster the drawing-room, and had boen refused with every one else. When he heclrd of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood him\u017felf to be the cause of it; but when he leclrned that he was deemed in\u017fane, his exultation and pleasuro could hardly be c0ncealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He bastened to the house of his former compariion, arid, by constarit atteridance, and the pretencc of great affcction for tbe hrother and interest in his fate, he gradually wori tbe ear of Misf Aubrey. Who could resist his p0wer? His tongue had dangers and toils lo recount\u2014eould speak of himsclf as of an indjvidual having no sympalhy with any being on the crowdod earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell bow, since ho knew her, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might Iisten lo her sootbing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the ferpent'f art, or such was the will of fclle, that he gained her affections. Tbe title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an importanl embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged stale,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, whcn he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servarils, but in vain. He asked far pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a lelter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiriess, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in lheir arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, ori which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought jt betler not to harass any inore the mind of Miss Aubrey by, wbat he considered, lhe ravings of a rnaniac. N ight passed on without rest to lhe busy inmatef of the houfe; and Aubrey heard, with a horror tbat may more easily be conceived than descri6ed, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the \u017found of earriages broke upori his ear. Aubrey grew almosl fraritic. The curiasity of the servants at last overeame tbeir vigilance, they gradually stole away, leauirig him in the custody of an helplcss old woman. He feized the opportunity, with orie bound was out os the room, and in a moment found himself iri the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approoched, and, taking his arm hy force, hurried him from the room, spcecbless wlth rage. When ori the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered iri his ear\u2014\"Remeinbor your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sisler is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atteridants, who, raused by lhe old woman, had comc in search of hirn. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage nat finding uent, had hrokeri a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed tohed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was n0t present when be entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnjzcd, and the bride and bridegroam left London.\nAubrey's weakness lncreased; tho effusion of blood praduced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and wben thc midnight hour had struck, he relaled compofedly what the reader has perused\u2014be died immedjately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, il was too late. Lord R vthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted lhe thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was alI before him, wbere to choose his place of rost, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Soiling tbrougb the Grecjan Arcbipelago, ori board one os his Majesty's vessels, in lhe yeclr 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, ln the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Britisb vessels to visit it\u20146oth men os war arid merchantmen; and thovgh jl lies rather out of the track for ships bound lo Smyrno, its bounties amply repay for the deviation 0f a voyage. We landed; as vsual, at the bottom of tbe bay, and whi1st the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining sor cattle with the natlves, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave calIed Homer's Schoo1, and other places, where we had been before. Ori the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a yaung Greek as our gvide, who told us he had come froin Scio withan Englifh lord, who left the island four days prevlaus to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sald tho Greck, \"and would have taken me with hirn; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likoly to get mclrried. He was an odd, but a very good mclri. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an oId man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechinos for it, (about L250 Eng1ish currency,) and has resided there about fovrteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his fe1ucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis aceount excitedour curiosity uery rnuch, and we lost na time in hastening to tbe house wbere our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who canducted us over the mansion. It c0nsisted af four apartments on the gr0und-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitling parlour, clnd a bed-room, with a spacious closel annexed. They were all simply decoraled: plain green-stained waIls, marble tabIes on either side, a lclrge myrtle jn the centre, and a small fauntain beneath, which c0uld be made lo play through the branches bymoving a spring flxed in the sjde of a small 6ronze Venus in a leaning posture; a Iarge coueh or sofa completed thefumiture. In the hall stood half a dozen Eriglish cane chairs, and an emply book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchainber had mere1y o large maltr-\nes\u017f fpread on the sloor, with two stuffed cotlan quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room wo observed a marble recess, formerly, the ald man told us, filled with books and papers,which were then in a large seaman'schost in the closet: it was apen, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileav's, and Rousfeclu's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari languagc; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Itcllian edition, printed al Parina in 1810; severaI small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantiriople, mucb t om, but no English book of any description. Most of theso books were filled with marginol notes, written with a penciI, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to pIace them with theotbers; but,\" sajd he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he isso parti cular, that were I to move orie thing wilhout orders, he would frown upon me for a week togcther; he is othcrways very good. I onee did him a service; and I haue theproduce of this farm for tbe trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeehines which I pay to an oged Armenian who resides in a small cottagc jn the woad, and wham the lord broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for whot reasori.\"\nThe appear ance of thehouse externally was pleasing. The p0rtico in fronl was flfty paces long and sourteen broad, arid the flvled marble pil-\nlars with b1ack plinths arid fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architeoture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surraunded by a lighlstone ha1ustrade, wascoverod by a fine Tvrkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong c0arse lincn. Most of the hovse-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frult, and enjoying the evening breeze.\n0n the lcft hand as we enlered the bouse, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering logether on its horders, and under the shade of two large myrt1e bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placcd, 0n which we were told, lhe lord passed many of his ovenings and nights til1 twelve o'clock, rcading, writirig, and talking to himself. \"I supposo,\" said tbe old inan, \"prayjng\" for ho was verydevout, \"and always atlended our church twiee a woek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view srom this seot was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye vicw.\" A line of rich vineyards led tbe eye to Mourit Calc1a, couered with olive ond myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of whlch an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. Asmall stream issuing from the ruiris doscended in broken ca\u017fcades, uritil it was lo\u017ft in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon vnshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in fronl; and a little on the left, thr0ugh a vista of lofty chesnut and pcllm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observod, studding the light blue wave wilh spots of emerclld green. I seldom enjoyed o view more than I did tbi\u017f; but our enquiries were fruitless a\u017f to the name of the person who had resided in this romaritic solitvde: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candicl. \"The Armeriian,\" said our eonductor, \"cou1d tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare nat.\" We had not time to vi\u017fit the Armenjan, but on our retum to the town we learnt severa1 particulars of thc isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was la\u017ft upon the island, ondeven danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one inan, horses to others, arid cotton and silk lo the girls who live by weaving these artioles. He also boughl a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collected, to bave been a very eccentric and benevolent choracter. Onc circumstance we learnt, which ovr ald friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautifu1 daughter, with whom the lard was oflen seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piana-forte, and taught her himself thc vse of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imagjnations all on the rack, guessing wbo this rambler in Greece covld be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and aIl those eccentricities which mark peculjar genjus. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts wcre dlspel1ed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pvpil of WYATT'S, who had hecn travellirig in Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual,\" sajd he, \"aboul whom yov are so anxiaus, if Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island os Tericdos, and I alfo visited him at Milylene.\" We had never then heard of hif lordship's fame, as we bad been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we rccognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret riot having been more euriaus in 0ur researches at the cottage, bvt we cansoled ourselvef with the idccl of returnirig to Mitylene ori somc suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slatemenl, belleving il riot quite uninteresting, and in ju stice to his lordship's good narne, which has been grossly slandered. He has been descri-\nbed as of an unseeIing dispo\u017fition, clverse to associaling with human nature, or contributing iri any way to sooth its sorrow\u017f, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered froin these little anecdotes. All the finer foe1irigs of the heart, so elegantly depicted jn his lordship's poems, secm lo have their seat in his bosom. Teriderness, sympathy, and charity appear to gvide allhis actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additiancll reason for marking him as a beirig on whose heort Religion hath set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantIe. Na man can reod the preceding pleasing \"traits\" wit-\nhout feeling proud of hjm a\u017f a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleosurof, I do riot assume a right to give an opiniori. Reporls are ever to be received with oaution, parlicularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares ju\u017ftify himself before thal awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is lhe surest tostimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-e0urt, Fleet-street.","23":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tole.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general iri tho East. Amang the Ara6ians it appears to be common: it did riot, however, extend itself lo the Greeks until clfter the establishrnent ofChristianity; and it has 0nly assumed its preserit form since the djvision of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timc, the idea bocoming prevalent, that a Latin body cauld riot corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradual1y incroased, and formed thc subject of mony wonderful stories, still extant, of lhe dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the 6lood of the young and beautiful. In the We\u017ft it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyref nightly imbibed a certain portiori 0f the blood of their victims, who became emaclaled, lost their strength, and speedily died of consvmptions; wbilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and thoir ueins hecame distended to such a state of replolion, as to cause the blood to flow from a1l the passages of their bodles, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible acoount of a parliculor cclse of vampyrism, which is \u017ftated to have occurred clt Madrcyga, in Hungary. It appcars, thal upon an examination of tbe coinmander-in-chief and magistrates of the plaoe, they posilively and unariimously affirmed, that, about fivc years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard to say, thal, at Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented hy a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself os the evil, by eating some of the earth ovt of the vampyre's grave, and rub6ing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevenl him srom bec0ming a vampyre hiinself; for,about twenty or thlrty days after bif death and burial, many pers0ns cornplained of having been tormented by him,and a deposition was made, tbat four persons had been deprived of life by hif attocks. To preverit furthcr mischiof, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, ond found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresb, and entirely free from corruplion, and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praof having been thus obtained, they resorted lo the accustomed romedy. A stakc was drivenentirely through tho hoart and body of Arnold Paul, atwhich he is roported to have cricd out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and tbrew the ashes into his grave. The same measvres were adopted with the corses of those persans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in tbeir turn, become agents upon others who survived lhem.\nThe unjversal belief is, that a person fucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himse lf, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomantade is bere related, because it seems hetter adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations thari any other instance wbich could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as cl sort 0f punishmenl after dealh, for \u017fome heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrlse, but compelIed to confine his infornal visitations solely lo lhose beings he loved inost while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of k indred and affcction.\u2014A supposition alludod to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, os Vampyresent, Thy oorse shallsrom its tomb be rent; Then gha stly haunt tbe na tive placo, Arid suek the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain theftream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perf0rce Must feed thy ljvid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yct expire, Shall kn0w the de mori for thcir sire; As cur\u017fing thee, thou cvrsing them, Thy flowers are withered on tbe stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shal1 hlcss thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart iri flame!

Yet wilh thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard Iip; Then stalking to thy \u017fullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Asrjtsraue, Till theso in horror \u017fbrink away From spectre more cleoursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also introduced in his wild bul beautiful poern of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having retumcd from the grave f0r the purpose of lormonting bim she best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence. But lhis cannot be supposed to bave resultod from tbe sinfulness of ber life, she being pourtrayed throughout lhe whole of the talo as cl complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonisbing cases os vampyrism, to whieh he pretends to havc been on eyewitness; and Ccllmet, in his great work upon this svbject, bcsides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionclry narralives illustralive of ils effects, has put sorth saine learnod disserlations, tending lo prove it to be a clclssical, as wcll as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible fuperstition might be added; though the present may suffioe for tbe limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mercly remarking, thclt though the tcrm Vampyrc is the one in most general acceptation, there ore several others synonymous with it, inade use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried that in the mjdst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, therc appeared al the vario us partics of the loadcrs of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than hi\u017f rank. Ho gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participale therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell lt, and throw fear jnto those b reasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation os awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance l0 pierce through to the inward working\u017f of the heart; but fell upon the cbeek with a leaden ray lhat wejghed upon the skln it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished tosee him, and those who hadbeen accustomed t0 violent ex citement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging tbeir attention. In spite of tbe deadly hue of hi\u017f face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong em olionof passion, though its forrn and oulline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, somc marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dresf 0f a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014thougb in vain:\u2014whcn she sto od before him, thavgh his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffIed, ond she left the field. But though the common adultress could not insluence evon tho guidance of his eyes, it wa\u017f riot that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet such was the apparcnt caution with which he spoke to the virluous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addre\u017fsed himself ta females. He had, however, thc reputation of a wirining tongue; and whetber it was tbal it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moued by his apparent batred of vice, he was as often amorig thosc females who form tbe b0ast of their sex from thelr domestic virtues, asamong tho\u017fe who sully it by tbeir vicos.\nAhout the same time, there came to London a young gentloman of tho naine of Aubrey: be was an orphan left wlth an 0nly sister in the p0ssession of great wealtb, by parents who died while he was yet in childhaod. Left alsa to hjmself 6y guardians, who thought it thejr duty rnerely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the cclro os mcrcenary subalterns, he cultivated more his lmagination thon hjs judgmonl. He had, hence, tbat high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliriers' apprentioes. He believed all to sympathise wilh virtue, and thoughl that vice was thrown in by Providencc merely for thc picturesque effcct of the seene, as we see in romancef: he thought that tbe misery 0f a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warin, but which wero better adapted t0 the paintcr'seye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in f ine, that the dreams of poets were the realilies of life. Hc was handsome, frclnk, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many motherf surrovnded him, striving which sbould describe with leost truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenanoef when he approclched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lod him into false notions of his talerits and bis merit. Attached as he was to the romanco of bis solitary hour\u017f, he was startled al finding, that, except in the lallow and wax eandles that flickered, not from the p resence of a ghost, but from warit os snufflng, there was no foundation in reol life for any of that congeries of pIeasing piclures and descriplions c0ntained in those vol umes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensatiori in his gratified vanity, hewas obout to re1iriquish his dreclms, when the extraordinary being we have ab0ve defcribed, crossed him in his oareer.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibilily of forming an idea of tbe charaoter of a man entirely absorbed iri bimself, who gave few olber signs of his obseruation of external ohjects, than tho tacit assent to their exi\u017ftence, implied by the avoidarice of their contact: allowing bis imagination to pioture every lhing that flattered itf propensity lo extravagant idea\u017f, he soon formed this object inla the hero of a romarice, ond determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, ra ther than the person bcfore him. He became acquointed wjth him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his nolice, that his presenoe was always recognised. He gradualIy lcarnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarras\u017fed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, thal he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining somc information rospecting this singular character, who, till naw, had only whetted hls curiosity, he hinted to his guardions, that it was time for him to porform the tovr, which for rnany generations hasbeen thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stepf in the career of vicc towards putting themselvesupon an equality with the aged, and riot allowing them toappear as if fallen from the skief, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, acoordirig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning his inlentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to rec eive from him a proposal to join hlm. Flattcred by suoh a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, be gIadly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no 0pportunjtyof studying Lord Ruthven'\u017f character, and now he fovnd, that, though many more of hls actions were exposed to his view, the resvlts offered different conclusions from the opparent molives to his conduct. His eompanion was profusc in his 1iberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from hi\u017f hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortvnes attendant oven vpon virtue, that ho bestowed hl\u017f alms;\u2014these were sent srom the doorwith hardly \u017fuppressed sneers; but when the pr0fligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in his lvst, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, ottributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Tbere was orie circumstance about the charjty of his Lordship, which was ftill more impressed upon his mind:al1 thase upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that lhere was a curse upon il, for they were all either led to the seasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowrif thraugh which they passed, Aubrey was surprjzed at the apparent eclgerness wjth which his companion sought for the centres of oll fashionable vice;thero heentered into all the spirit of the faro table: ho betted, and always gambled witb succesf, except where the knowri sharper was hjs antagonist, and theri he lost even more than he gained; but it was always wilh the same urichanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encouritered the rasb youthful novice, or the luckless falher of a numerous fami1y; then his very wish secined fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness af mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the eot wbilst dalIying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former1y affluent youth, lorn from the circle ho adomed, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate thal had drawn him within the reach of this fjerid; whilst many o father sat frantic, amid\u017ft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet be took no money from the gambling table; bvt jmrnediately lost, to the rviner of rnany, lhe last gilder he had ju\u017ft snatched from the eonvulsiue grasp ofthe innocent: this might but bc the result of a certain dogree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable as combating lhe cunning of the more experiericed. Aubrey osten wishod to reprcsent this to his friend, and bog him to reslgn thol charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his awn profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his frierid would give hlm some appartunity of speaking frankly and operily to him; however, this never occurre d. Lord Ruthven ln his carriage, and amidst lhe various wiId and rich scencs of nalure, wa\u017f always the fame: his oye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, heobtajned na greator gratification from it than the constant excitement of uainly wishing to break lhclt mystery, whlch to his exalted imagination began to assumc the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey \u017foon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time 1ost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendclnce upon the morning clrcle of an Italian countess, whilsl he went in search of the momorials of anather almost deserted city. Whllst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, whicb he opened with eagcr impaticnce; the first was from bis sister, breathing nothing bvt affcction; tbe others were srom his guordians, tbe lalter a\u017ftonished him; if it had befare entered inlo his imagiriation that tbere was an cvil power refident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason sor the bellef. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, arid vrged, that his character was dreadfulIy vicious, for that the passession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangorous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; bul that he had required, to erihance his gralification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from tbe pinnacle of unsullied virtuo, down to the lowe\u017ft abyss of infamy and degradation: jn fine, thot all tho\u017fe female\u017f whomhe had sougbt, apparently onaccount of their vlrtue, bad, since his departure, thrown even lhe mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of t heir vices to tbe publicgaze.\nAubrey determined upon leoving one, whofe character had not yct shown a single bright point on which to rest tbe eye. He resolved to lnvent some plausible pretext for abandoriing him altogether, purpofing, in the mecln while, to watch bim more closely, ond lo let no slight circurnstanccs pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperierice of the daughter of the lady whosc house he chlefly frequented. In Italy, it ls soldom that an unmarried female is met with in soclety; hc was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; 6ut Aubroy's cye sollowed bim in all his windings, and soon discove red that an clssigna lion had been appointed, which would most llkely end in the ruin of an innocerit, lhough thoughtless girl. Losjng no time, he cntered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his interitions with respect to tbe lady, informing him at the same time that he wa\u017f aware 0f his being about to meet her lhatvery nlght. Lord Rvthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would haue upon such an occasion; and upon bejng pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immedi ateIy writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remain der of their proposed t0ur, he orderod his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not 0nly with regard to hor daughter, bul also concerning the character of hls Lordship. The assignation wasprevented. Lord Ruthvon next day morely sent hls servant to notify hiscomplete as\u017fent to a separation; but did not hlnt any \u017fuspicion of his plans having been foiled hy Aubrey's interpo\u017filion.\nHaving lcft Rorne, Aubrey dlrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing tho Peninsula, saon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his resjdence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon oceupied hjmseIf in lracing tbe faded recards of aneient glory upon manuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden theinselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured llchen. Under the same roof as himself, oxisted a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model sor o paintor wishing to pourlray on cclnvass tho promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think \u017fhe could belorig to th0se wh0 had no souls. As she daneed upon the plain, 0r tripped along lhe mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typc of her beautie\u017f; for who would bave excbanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious laok of the aniinal suited but to the tasle of an epicure. The light step of Iarithe osten accompanied Aubrey in hls search after antiquities, arid oftcn would the uneonscious girl, engagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere hutterfly, sbow lhe whole beauty of her form,sloalirig as itwere upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the lettcrs he had just decyphered upon an almost esfaced tablet, in tbe contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as sbe flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray sucb delicately brilliant and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the aritiquary, who let cscape from his injnd the very object he had before thougbt of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passclge in Paufan-\nias. Bul why attempt to describe charms which all feel, bvt none can clppreciate?\u2014It was innoccnce, youth, and beauty,unaffected by erowded drawing-rooms arid stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for hls fulure hours, she wovld stand by, and watcb the magic effects of his pencil, in tracjng the scenes of her native place; she w0uld then desc ribe to hjm the eircling dance upon lhe open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colourf of youthful memory, the morriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irifancy; arid then, turning to subjects that had evidently mode a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all tbe supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narroted, excited the iriterest even of Aubrey; and often os she told him the lale of thc living vampyre, who had passed years amldst his friends, and dearesl lies, sorced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femclle to prolong his existence for the ensving months, bis blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrlble fantasies; but Ianthe cited t0 him the names of old men, who had at lclst detected one living ainorig lhemselves, after severa1 of their near re latives and children had 6een found marked with the stomp of the fiend's appelite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had \u017fome proof giveri, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was truc. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of those monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthuen; he, bowcver, still pcrsifled in persuading her, that there could be no trvth jn her fears, thovgh at the same time he wondered al the many coincidences whicb had olI lended to excite a belief in lhe supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself moro and more to Ianthe; her lnnocerice, so contrasted withall the affected virtues os the womcn omong whom he bad fougbt for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habjts, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himsclf more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ol times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquaricln research, be would depart, determined not to return until his objeot was attajned; but he always found it lmpossible to six his attention upon the ruins arovnd hirn, wbi1st ln his mind horetained an image that soemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of hif love, and was ever the same frank infantile boing he had first known. She always seomed to part srom him with reluctance; bvt it was bccause she had no longer any one wjlh whom shc cauld visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealod to her parerits on the fubject os Vainpyref, and they both, with seuercll present, affirmod their existence, pale with horror at tbe very name. Soon after, Aubrey determiried to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, lhey all at once begged of him not ta return at riight, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, whero no Greek wovld ever remain, after the dayhad closed, upon any consideration. They described it cl\u017f the rcsort of the vampyres in tbeir nocturnal orgies, and denounced the moft heavy evils as impending upon him who dored to cross their path. Aub rey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh thcm out of the idea; but when he sclw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a fuperjor, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made lheir blood freeze, be was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned ta find that his words, mocking the belief af those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When be was aboul to depart, Ianthe came to lhe side of his horse, and eamestly bcgged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of lhese beings to be pul in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however,so occupied in his resoarch, that he did not per-\nceive that d ay-light would soan end, and tbat iri the horizon there was one of th0se \u017fpecks which, in the warrner climates, so rapidly gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their rage upon the dovoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was t0o late. Twilight, in these \u017fouthern climates, is almo sl unknown; immedjately the sun sets, nighl beginf: and ere he bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its eoh0ing thunders had scarcely aninterval os rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightnirig seemed lo foll and radiate ot his very feet. Suddenly hjs h0rse took fright, and he was earried with dreadsul rapldity through the entangled forest. Tbe animal ot last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightnirig, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhot hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead Ieaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismovriting, he approached, hoping to findsome one to gvide him to the tawn, or at least trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for a moment silent, alIowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with thc stifled, exu-\nltant mockery of a laugh, contiriued in one aImoft unbrokcn sound;\u2014he was startled: hut, roused by tbe thunder whicb again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: lhe sovnd, however, gujded him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still tbe sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himsclf in contacl with some one, whom heimmediate1y seized; when a voice cried, \"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whoso strenglh seemed superhumcln: determined to sell his life as dearly as be could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he waf lifted froin his feel and hurled with enormous for ce against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himseIf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed bis hands vpon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches perietrating througb the hole lhat gave light in the day, difturbed him;\u2014he instantly r0se, and, leaving his prey, rushed thr0ugh the door, and in a m0ment the crashirig of lhe branches, os he broke through the wo0d, was no longer beard. The ftorm was now still; and Aubroy, incapable of moving, was soon heard by th0se without. They entered;the light of their tarches fell upon the mud wa1ls, and the thalch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire 0f Aubrcy they searched for her who hadattracted him by her cries; he was again lefl in darkncss; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnore burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a Iifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping thclt it was bul a vision arising from his disturbed imaglncltion; but he again saw the same form, when be uriclosed them, stretched by his sjde. There was no colovr upon her cheok, not even upon bor lip; yet there was a stlllnoss about her face that seemed cllmost af attaching as the lifc that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and broast waf hlood, clnd upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vclmpyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sjde as her wbo had 1ateIy been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now sclllen with the flower of life that had died within ber. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to fhun reflection, and take refuge in vaconcy\u2014he held almost unc onsciously in bis hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which bad been found in thc hut. They wore soon met by differcnt parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as lhey approached the city, forewarned the parents of soine drcadful catcl\u017ftrophe. \u2014To describe lheir grief would be jmpossible; but when they ascertclined the cause of their child'f death, tbey looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolab1e; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized witha m0st violent fever, and was osten deliriovs; in these interval\u017f he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by \u017fome unaccountab1e combinatiori he seemed to bcg of bls former componion lo spare tbe being he Ioved. At other limes he would imprecate mclledictions upon his head, and curse bim as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, cbanced at thjs time to arrive at Athcns, and, from whatever motlvc, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placedhimself inthe same bousc, and became his con\u017ftant atlendant. When the latter recovered srom bis delirium, he was horrlflod and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that os a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hjs kind words, irnplying olmost repentance for the sault thot bad causod their separation, and still more by the cltt enti0n, anxiely, and care which he showed, soon reconcilod him to his presenco. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that clpathetic being who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalesccnce began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state ofmind, and Aubrey perceiued no difserence frorn the former man, except that clt times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of molicious exultation pIaying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the 1ast ftage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was opparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by thc cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circlirig, like our world, the movelefs sun;\u2014indeod, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened, and that e1astioity of spirit which had once \u017fo distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but muoh as hc wished for solitude, his mind covld not find it in the neigbbovrhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst tho ruins be had formerly frequentod, Ianthe's f0rm \u017ftood by hjs side\u2014if he sovghl it jn the woods, her lighl step w0uId appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, t0 his wiId imagination, her pale sace and wounded throat, with a rneek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly \u017fcenes, every fcaturo of whjeh created such bitter ossociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender carc he had taken of bim during his i1lnesf, thal they should visit those parts 0f Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direclion, and sought every spot to which a recollectjon could be attached: but though lhey thus hastened from place to placc, yet they seemed nol to heed what they gazed up0n. They he ard much of robbers, hut they gradual1y began to slight these repor ts, which they imagiried were only the inverition of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosjty of those whom they de fended from pretended dangcrs. In consequence of thvs neglecting the advice of lhe inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, m0re to serve as guides thari as a defcnce. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, witb large masses of rock brought down from tho neighbovring precipices, they had reasori to repent lheir negIigence; sor scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narraw pafs, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed rcport of several guns. In ari instant their guclrds had left them, and, placing themselves 6ehind rocks, had begun to fire in the direclion whence the report cclme. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sbeItcring turn of the defile: but ashamed af being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts badc them advonce, and being exposed to uriresisting slaughter,if any of the robbers should climb obove arid take tbem in the rear, they determined at once t0 rush farward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of thc rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in thc shoulder, which brought him lo the groun d. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer boeding lhe conlest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing tbe robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrondered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon iriduced them to convey his woundedfriend to a neighbovring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being conlent merely to guard the entranco till their comrade sh0uld return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificatjon ensued, and deoth seemed advancing witb hasty steps. Hisconduct and appearance had not changod; he seemed as unconscious of pain cls he had been of thc objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced ta affer his assistance with morc than v\u017fual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you mcly save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean riot my life, I heed the death of rny exjstence as liltle as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" repljed Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if yov would conceal all you know of me, rny honour were free from stain in the world's rnoulh\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by al1 your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowIedge of my crirnes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014Hi\u017f eyes seomed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hi\u017f pll1ow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did nol sleep; lhe many circumstances attending his acquairitance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering eame over him, as if from the presentimenl of something horriblo awaiting him. Rifirig early in the morriing, he was aboul to eriter the hovel in which he had left thc corpse, when a robbor met blm, and informed him that it was no longer there, havirigbeen conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a rieighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordship, that it shouId be exposed to the first cold ray of thc moon that rose after bif death. Aubrey astoriished, clnd taking several of the men, determined to go clnd bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he bad rnounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the olothes, though the robbers sw ore lhey pointed out the identical rockon which they had laid the body. For cl timehis mind was bewlldered in conjecturcs, but he at last returned, canvinced that thoy had burjed the corpse for the sake os the clothes.\nWeary of a couritry in which he had mot with sueb terrible misforturies, and in whieh a1l apparenlly conspired to heighten that superstitious meIancholy that had seized upon his mind, hc rosolved to leove it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wcliting for a vessel to convey him lo Otrant0, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he hcld with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbings there was a case containing seve ral woapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were s everal daggers arid ataghans. Whilst turnlng them over,and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at firiding a fheath apparentIy omarnentod in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falal hut\u2014be shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may 6e imagined whcn hc discovered that lt fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he hold in his hand. His eyes seemed ta need no furtber certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished t0 disbe1ieve; but the partieular form, tbe same varying tints upon the haft and sbeath were alike in splendour on botb, and left no room for d0ubt; there were also drops 0f blood on each.\nHe lefl Sm yrna, and on his way bome, ot Rome, his first inquiries were concerning lhe lady ho had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distre\u017fs, their fortune ruinod, and she had not been heard of since the deporture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beoame almost broken under so many repeated horrors; hc wa\u017f afraid thal this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation c0nsi\u017ftedin urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going t0 save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to tbc English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathcrs, and there, for a moment, appearod to lose, in the embr aces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she bcfore,by her infanline caresses, bcld gained his affoction, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had nol that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause 0f the drawirig-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliclncy which onIy exists in tbe heated atmospbere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was riever lit vp by the levity of lhe rnind beneath. There was a melanch oly charm about it which did not seem lo arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, whioh strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened hy the smile of joy; but when her hro-\nther breathed ta her his affection, and would in her prefence forgot those griefs sbe knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for thal of the volupluclry? It seemed as if th0se eyes,\u2014lhat face were then playirig in the light of lheir own nalive sphere. She was yet orily eightcen, and had not been presenled to the world, it havjng been thought by her guardianf more fit thot her prescntation \u017fhould be delayed until her brother's relurn from the contlnent, when he might beher proteotor. It was now, therefore, resolued that the next drawlng-room, which was fast approachirig, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would rather bave rernained ln themansion of bis fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest ahout the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind hcld been fo lorn by the cvents he had witnessed; but he determined lo sacrifice his own comforl to tho protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawlng-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014adrawing-ro0m had not beori held for a long lime, clnd all who were anxious to bask in the smile os royalty, hastened thither. A ubrey was there with hi\u017f sister. While he was stariding in o corrier hy himself, beedlefs of all around him, erigaged in tbe remombrance that the first tjme he had feen Lord Ruthuen was iri that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly feized by the clrm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remernber your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearfu1 of seeing a spoctre lhat would blast him, wheri he poreoived, at a little dlstance, the same figvre which bad attracted hif notice on this spot upon his first entry into sociely. He ga zed till hi\u017f limbs almost refuslng t0 bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage throvgh thc crowd, he threw himself irito bis carriage, and was driuen home. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, andfixcd his hands upon his head, as if ho were afraid his tboughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven agoin before him\u2014circumstances startod up in dreadfuI array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himsclf, he could not beliove it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014Ho thought bis imagination had conjured up lhe image his mlnd was restjng upon. It was jmposslb1e that it covld be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into socioty; for lhough he attempted to ask concerning L0rd Ruthven, tho name hung up0n hif lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights ofter with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsels up to his own devouring tbaughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused hjmself, and entering anolher room, faund his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in eamest convorsation; he attempted to pass arid get near her, when ane, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveaIed to hlm those features he mast abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with burried step, forced her towards tbe street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wajting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passlng them, he again heard that v0ice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oat-\nh!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn,but, hurrying his sister, soon rcached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If besore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more coinpletely was jt engrossed, now lbat the ccrtointy of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughls. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to exp1ain to her what had caused his abrvpt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he thaught, the more he was bewildered. His oath ftartled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monsler to roam, bearing ruin upori his bre-\nath, amidst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very \u017fister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose hif suspicians, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to frce the wor1d from fuch a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. F0r days he remained ln tbis stato; shut up in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when hi\u017f sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, far her sake, to support nature. At last, rio longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from stroet to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often expo\u017fed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight domps. He was no loriger to be recognized; at first he rcturned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook hirn. His sister, anxious for his safety, emplayed people to sollow him; but they were soon distanced by hirn who fled from a pursuer swifter than ony\u2014from th0ught. His can duct, however, su ddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he lofl by his ab\u017fence lhe wholo of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of wh0se pre\u017fence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiou\u017f ta forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intim acy. But when he entered into a roorn, hlshaggard and suspicious looks wore so striking, his inward shudderings sa visible, that his sister was at last obliged to bog of him to abstairi from soeking, for her sake, a socjety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper ta lnterpose, and, fearing tbat his mjnd was becoming alienated, they thought it bigh time to resumo ogain that trusl which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the jnjuries and sufferings he had daiIy encountered in hi\u017f wanderings, clnd of preventing him from exposing to the gencral eye thase marks of what they corisidered solly, they engaged a pbysician to reside in the house, and take coristant core of him. He hardly appeared t0 notice it, so completely was his mind absorbod by one terrible subject. His incoherence becamo at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There ho would often lie for dayf, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had ottained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign ofaffection and recollectjon remaining displayed itself upon the eritry os his si ster; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, be would desire her not lo louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your 1ove for me is aught, do not g0 near him!\" Wheri, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again ho sank into a state, whence nat even she cauld rou\u017fe him. This lasted mariy months: graduaIly, however, as lhe year was passing, his incoherences became less frequcnt, and hjf mind threw off cl portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that sevcral times ln theday be would caunt upon bjs fingers a definlte number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the yeor, one of his guardlans entering his room, begari to converse with his physician upon the melancholy clrcumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was goirig next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he a\u017fked anxiously to whom. GIad of this mark of returnirig intcllect, of whicb they feared he had been doprlved, they mentionod the riarno of thc Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and a\u017ftonisbed them still more by his expressing his intentionto be preserilat the nuptials, and desiring to soe his sister. They answered not, but iri a few minutes his sjster was with him. He was apparently again capable of being afsected by the influenoe of her lovely smile; for he pressedher to his breast, and kisfed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thovght of her brother's beirig once more alive to the feelings of afseotlon. He began to speak with al1 his wonted warinth, and to congratvlote hcr upon her marriage with a per\u017fon so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was hi\u017f surprisc al beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He sejzed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the rcsemblance of her future husband,he looked as if he did nat vnderstand her\u2014tben seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But hc could nol advance\u2014it seemed as if lhat voice again bado him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking L0rd Ruthven wcls near him but saw no one. In tho meantime the guardiansand phy\u017fician, who had heard the whole, andthought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desircd her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, atlributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of hif mind, erideavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-rooin, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he readily uriderstood himself to be the cavse of il; but when he lcarned that he waf deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be conceclled from those among whom he had gained this iriformation. He hastened to the house of his former companiori, and, byconstant atteridanee, and the pretence of great affectjon for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradvcllly wan the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recovnt\u2014could speak af himsels as of an individval havirig no syinpathy with ony being on the crowded earth, savc with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his exjftence, had 6egun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might liston to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. Tbe title of the elder branch falling at lenglh to hlm, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for bastenirig the marriage, (in spite of ber br0ther's deranged state,) which was to takc place the uery day before hif deporture for the contlnent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the fervonls, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; jt was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her,as she valued her owri happincss, her own hanour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who ance held her ln their arins a\u017f their hope and the hope of thoir house, to delay bvt for a few bours tbatmclrriage, 0n which he denounced tbe most heavy curscs. Tbe servants pramised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thovght it better not to haras\u017f ony more the mind of Misf Aubreyby, what he consjdered, the rclvings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest ta the busy lnmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easjly be oonceived than described, the notes af busy prcparatlon. Morning come, and lhe sound ofcarriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew aImost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at laft ovcrearne their vigiIonce, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tbe cust0dy of an be1pless old womari. He seized the opportunity, with onc bound was out of the room, and in a moment found hlmself jn the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takirig his arm by soree, hurried bim srom the room, speechless with rclge. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Re member your oath, and know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonourod. Women are srail!\" S0 saying, he pu\u017fhed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, cls the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weclkne\u017fs increased; the effusi0n of blood produced symptoms af the near approach of deoth. Hedesirod his sister's guardians might be called, and when lhe midnight h0ur had struck, he related composedly what the reader haf perused\u2014he dicd immediately after.\nThe guardianshasteried lo protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was loo latc. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted tho thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND DF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE,&c.\n\"The world was all before hirn, where lo ch0ose his pIace of rest, and Providence his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing throvgb tbe Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels,in the year 1812, we putinto the harbour ofMitylene, iri the island of tbat narne. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply os cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induoe many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and inorcbantmen; and tbough it ljes rather out of lhe track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply ropay for the devialion of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purscr bargaining for cattle with tho natives, the clergyman and myfelf took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and othcr places, where wo had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mo nticvle so named) we met with and engaged a y0ung Greek as our gvide, who told us he had eome fram Scio with an English lord, who left the islond four days previous lo our arriual in bls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said tbe Greek, \"clnd would have taken rne with him; hut I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am like1y to get marricd. He was an odd, but a very good man. The eottage over the hlll, facjng the ri ver, beIongs to him, arid he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trclder, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 Engljsh currency,) arid has refided there about f0urteen montbs, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very osten to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosjty very much, and we lost no tiine in hastening to the housewhere our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us aver the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floar\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-roorn, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on eithor side, a lar ge myrtle in the centre, and a smclll fountain beneath, which co uld be made to play through thc branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poslure; o large couch or sofa completed the furniture. Inthe hall stood half a dozen English cane cbair\u017f, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor asingle paintlng. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on tbe floar, with two stuffed cotton quilts arid a pillow\u2014the comman bed tbroughout Greece. In the sitling-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with boaks and papers, which were then iri a large seainan's chest in the closet: it was apen, but we dld not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of tbe recess lay Voltairc's, Shakspeclre's, Boileau's, and Rousfeau's works complete; VoIney's Rulns of Empires;Zjmmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 181O; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with inarginal notos, written with a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and markcd with \u017fljps of paper, an which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading lhese books the evening before be sailcd,and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they musl lje until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon mo for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him cl service; and I have tbe produce of lhi\u017f farm for the troublc os taking eare of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearonce of the ha use externally was plcasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pil1ars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grccian architeeture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wa\u017f covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them thc Grceks pass tbeir evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying tbe cvening breeze.\nOn the left hand os we enterod the house, a sma1l streamlct glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shclde of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on whjchwe were lold, the lord pas\u017fed many of his evenings and nigbts till twelvc o'clock, reading, wriling, andtalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was vory devout, \"and always attended our chureb twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this soat waswhat may bc termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led lhe eye to M0unt Calcla, covered with olive and inyrtle trees in blaom, and on the summit of wbich an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smaIl stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascodes, until it waf last in the woods near the mauntain's ba\u017fc. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizori unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view iri front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chcsnut clnd palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with fpots of emerald green. I seldom onioyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitlcss as to the name of the person who bad resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Arme-\nnian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare n0t.\" We had nat time to visit the Armenian, bvl on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of tbe isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to onc man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thc glrls who live by weaving these articles. He a1so bought a new boat far a fisherman wbo had Iost his own in a gclle, ond he often gave Greek Testaments to tbe poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolentchclracler. One circumstance we learnt, which our old frierid at the cottage thought proper not to disc1ose. He had a most beautiful daugb ter, with whom the lord was often seen wal klng on the sea-shore, and he had boughl hera piano-forte, and taught her hlmself the use of it.\nSuch was the iriformation wilh which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imclgjnations all on the raok, guesslng who this rainblerin Grecce could be. He had money jt was evident: hehad philanthropy of disposition, and all thoso eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company wilh Mr. FOSTER, the architcct, a pupil os WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, if Lord Byron;I met him in my travels on the island af Tenodos, and I cllso uisited him at Mitylcne.\" We had nevcr then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had becn some years from home; but \"ChiIde Harolde\" 6eing put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Ca1cla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the eottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, belieuing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has heen described as of on unfeeling disposition, averse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direetly lhe reverse, as inoy be plairily gathered srom these little anecdotes. AlI tbe finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicled in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatby, and charily appeclr to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason f0r rnarkjng hirn as a being on whose heart Religion hath sct her seal, and ouer whose hecld Benevolcnce hatbthrown her mant le. No man can read the preceding pleafing \"traits\" without f eeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not as\u017fumc a right l0 give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when direcled against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before thal awful tribunal where all must appear, al0ne may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's eharacter is worthy of bis genius. To do goad in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous hcart and seIf-approving c onsoience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Flcet-slreet.","24":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very gerieral in the East. Arnong thc Arabians it appears to be common: it did nol, however, extend itself to the Greek\u017f until after lhe establishment of Cbristianity; clnd it has only assumed its present form \u017fince the division of the Latln and Greek churches; clt which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin bady could not corrupt is buried in their territory, it grodually increclsod, arid formed the subject of many wonderful staries, still extant, of the dead ri\u017f ing from their graves, and foedirig upon lhe blood os the young and bcautiful. In the We\u017ft it spread, wilh some sIight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, ond Lorraine, where the beIief existed, that vampyres nig htly imbihed a certclinportjon of tbe blood of their uictims, who beoarne emaciated, lost their strength, and specdily died os consumptions; whilst tbese human bIood-\u017fuckers fattened\u2014and lhelr veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the verypores of thoir skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, 1732, is a eurious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to hove occvrred at Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unclnimovsly affirmed, that, about sive yoclrs befo-\nre, a certoin Heyduke, nained Arnold Paul, had beeri heord to say, tbat, at Cassovia, on the froritiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, bvt had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of lhe earth out of the vampyre's grave, arid rubbing himself wjth his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him frorn bccoming a vampyro himself; for, a6out twenly or thirty days aftcr his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a depo\u017filion was made, that four perfons had beendeprived of 1ife by hi\u017f attacks. To prevent furtber mischief, the inhabitants bavirig consulted their Hcldagni, took up tho b0dy, clnd sound it (as is supposed to be usual in casos of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free srom corruption, arid emitting at the movth, nose, and ears, pure and f1orid bIo0d. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was drivcn entirely through the heart and hody of Arno1d Paul, at which he is reporled to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his bead, burned his body, and tbrew the ashes into his grave. The same moasures were adopted with the carsesof those persons who bad previously died fr0m vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upori others wba survived them.\nThe universal helies is, thclt a person sucked by a vampyre 6ocomes o vampyre himself, and \u017fucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis mon\u017ftrouf rodomontade is here related, because it scemf better adapted to illustratethe svbject of the present observations than any 0ther instariee whieh could be adduced. In inany parts of Greece it is consjdered as a sorl of punishment after death, sor some heirious crime committed whi1st in existence, that the deceosed is riot only doomed to uampyrise,but compelled to confine his infernal visltations sole1y to those beings he loved most while upan earth\u2014those to whom he was bound hy ties of klndred arid affeelion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suok the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet whjch perforce Mvst feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for tbeir sire; As curslng thee, thov cursing them, Thy flowers are withered an the stem. But one that for thy crime mustfall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thov rnust end tby task and rnark Her cheek's last tirige\u2014hor eye's last\u017fpark, And tbe last glasfy g lance mu\u017ft view Which freezes o'er it\u017f lifeless blue;Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in Iife a lock when sborn Aff ection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial af thino agony! Yet wjth thine owri best bload shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Til1 these in harror shrink away From spectre more accursed than thcy.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of tbe Arabion maid Oneiza, whois ropresented as having returned from tbe grave for the purpose of tormonting him sbe best loved whilst in existence. Bvt this cannol be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout lhe whole of the tale as a comp1ete type af purity and innocence. The vcracious Tour nefort gives a long account in his travels of several aslonjshing cases of vampyri\u017fm, to which he prctends to bave been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his groat w0rk upon thi\u017f subject, beside\u017f a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, ha\u017f put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a clas\u017fical, as woll as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible fuperstition might be added; tbough thc present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be conclvded by merely remarking, tbat though the term Vampyre is the one in most general aeceplation, lbere are severaI others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened thot in the midst of lho dissipationf atlendant upon a London wjnter, there appeared at the various parties af the leaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, thcln his rank. Hc gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate thorejn. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those brcafts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those wbo felt this sensationof awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to lhe dead grey eye, whioh, slxing upon the objoct's face, did not seem to penetrate, and al arie glance to pierce thr0ugh to the inward workings of the heart; bvt fell up0n the chcek with a lcaden ray that weighed upon tho skiri it could not pass. His poculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accuslomod to violent excitement, and now fe1t the welght of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagingthelr attentjon. In spite of the deadly huo of his faoe, which never gained a warmer tjnt, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though ils form and outline were beautiful, many 0f the female huntor\u017f after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of whal they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mo ckery of every monstershewn in drclwing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on lhe dress of a mountebank, lo attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, lh0ugh his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it scemed as if they were unperceivcd;\u2014even her vnappalled impudence wcls baffled, and she left thc field. But thovgh the comman adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, il was not that tho fema1e sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with whicb he spoke to the uirtuous wife and innocent daughter, that sew knew he ever addressed hjmsels to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whethor it was that il euen 0veroame the dread of his singular choracter, or that tbey wore moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was asoften among those fe males who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, os among lho\u017fc who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came ta London a young gentleman of the name af Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister ln the possessi0n of great wealth, by parents wbo diod while be was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians,wh0 th ought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the inore importanl charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, honce, that high romaritic feeling of honour and cand0ur, which daiIy ruins so many mllliners' apprentices. He beIieved all to sympathise witb virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence morely for the plctvresqueeffect of the scenc, as we see in romances: he thougbt that the misery os a oottage merely consisted in tbe vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which wero better adapted to the painter's eye by thcir irregular folds and voriou\u017f coloured patches. He thought, in fino, that the dreams of pocls were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth lheir langvishing or rompirig favourjles: the doughters at tho same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by thcir sparkling eycs, when he opened his lips, \u017foon led him into f alse notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romarice of his solitary hours, he was startled at sinding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thal flickered, not fr0m the prcsence of a ghoft, but from want of snvffing, there was no soundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasirig pictures and doscriptjons contcliried in those valumes, from which he had sormod his study. Firiding, however, \u017fome compensation in his gratified vanity,he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the cxtraordinary boing we bave above described, crofsed him iri his career.\nHe watched him; and lhe very impossibllity of forming an idea 0f the character of a man entirely absorbed in himsclf, who gaue few other signs os his observation of cxternal obiecls, than the tacjt assent to their exi\u017ftence, implied by the avoidance 0f thejr contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing tbat flatlered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inlo lhe hero of a romarice, and determjned to observe the offsprlng of his fclncy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainled wlth him, paid him attentions, and so far advariced upon his notice, that his pre\u017fence was cllway\u017f recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rvthven's clffajrs were embarras\u017fed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous0s gaining some information respeeting tbis singular character, who, till now, had only whetled hi\u017f cvriosity, he hinted to his guordians, tbat il was time for bim to perform the tovr, which for many generations has been th0ught necesfary to ena6le the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards puttirig themselvos upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them toappear as if fallen from the skies, whenevor scandalou\u017f inlrigues are mentioned as lhe subjocts of plea\u017fantry or os praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in car-\nryjng them on. Tbey consented: and Aubrey imrnediatoly mentioning his intentions ta Lord Ruthven, wossurprised ta reccive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mclrk of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other inen, be gladly aecepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rutbven's oharacter, and now he found, tbat, lhough many more of hisactions were expased to his view, the results offored different conclusions from lhe apparont molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idlo, the vagabond, and the boggar, recejvedfrom his hand more lhan enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot vpon the virtuous, reduced to indigcnce by the misfortunes atlendant even upon virtue, that he bestowod his alms;\u2014these were sont from tbe door wilh hardly suppres\u017fed sne ers; but when the profligate caine to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wollow in his Iust, or to sink him stilI deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, clttributed byhim to the greater irnportunity of tbe vicious, wbich gerierally prevails over the rctiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whomit was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaff0ld, or sunk to tbe lowest and tbe most abject misory. At Brussels and other towns through wb ich lhey pas\u017fed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eclgerness with wbich his companlon sought for the centres of all fashjonable vice; lhere he entered into all tbe spirit of lhe faro table: be betted, and always gambled with success, exccpt where the known sharper was hi\u017f antagonist, and then be lo\u017ft even more thon he gaincd; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which ho generally watched the society around: it waf not, however, so when he encouriterod the rash youthful novice, or tho lucklesf fathcr os a numerous family; then hls very wish seemed forlune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the eat whilst dallylng with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerIy affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorried, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeon, thefate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a fathor sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hurigry children, wilhout a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufsicierit to s atisfy their prescrit craving. Yet be took rio money from tbe gambling table;but jmmediately Iost, to the ruincrof many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of theinnocent: this rnight but be thc result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experiericed. Aubrey oflen wished to represent this to hls friend, and beg hiin to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend t0 his own profit;\u2014bvt he delayed il\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opparturiity of speaking frankly and openlyto him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and ricb scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than hislip; and though Aubrey was ncar the object ofhis curiosity, he 0btained no grcater gratification from it than the constarit excitement of vainly wlshing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nTbey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his c0mpanion; he left him in dai1y attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he werit in search of the inemorials 0f anotber almost deserled cily. Whilst be was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from hifsister, breathing nothing hut clffection; the others were from bis guardians, the latter astonifhed him; if it had before entered into bis imagjnation that there was an euil power resident in his companion, th ese seemed to give him sufficient reas0n for the belies. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving bis sriend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious babits inore dangerous ta society. It bad becn discovered, that his contempt for tbe adultress had not originated in hatrod of her character; but that he had required, to erihance his gratification, that bis vietim, tbe partner ofhis guilt, should he hurled from the plnnocle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thal all tho\u017fe females whom he had fought, apparently on clccount of their virlue, had, since his departure, thr0wn even tbe mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leauing one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invcnt somo plclusible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meon whiIe, to watch him more c1osely, and ta let no slight circumftances pa\u017fs byunnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordsbipwas endeav0uring to work upori the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met withjn society; he was lherefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in al1 his windings, and soon disoovered that an assignation had been appointed, which wovld mast likely end in the ruin of aninnocent, though thovghtless gir l. Losing no time, he entered the apartrnent of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his iritention\u017f with respect to the lody, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to ineet her that very night. LordRuthven answered, thathis intentions were such as he svpposed all would hove upon such ari acca\u017fion; and upon being pressed whether he iritended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retir-\ned; and, immediately writing a notc, to say, thot from that moment he must decIine accompanying his Lordsbip in the remainder af their proposed tour, he ordered his seruanl to seek other apartments, and caIling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all heknew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also ooncerning the charaoter of bis Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthuen next day merely sent his servant t0 notify his complcte assent to a separati0n; but did not hint any suspjcion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey direeted his steps towards Greece, and crossing lhe Peninfula, soon found himseIf al Athens. He then fixcd hjs resjdence iri tbe house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimsclf in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monumcnts thclt apparently, ashamed of chronicling tbe deeds of freemon only bosore sloves, had hiddcn themselves beneclth the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof cls himself, existod a being, s0 beautiful and delicote, that she might have formed tho model fora painter wishing to pourtray on carivass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much mirid for any one ta think she could belong to those who had no soul\u017f. As shc danced upon lhe plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thaugbt the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; forwho would have exchanged her eye, appareritly the eyc of animatod nature, for thclt sleepy luxurious l0ok of the anjma1 suited but to tbe taste of an epicure. The light step os Ianthe often accompanicd Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncons cious girl, engaged in the pursujt of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to thc eag er gaze of him, who forgot the letters hehad just decyphored upon an almost effacod lablet, in the eontempIation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresscs falling, clsshe flitted around, exhib it in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulnesf of tbe clntiquary, who let escape from his mind the uery abiect he had before tb0ught of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a pafsage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, bul none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youtb, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those romains of whieh ho wished to prescrve a memoriol sor his future hours, she would stand by, arid watch the magie effecls 0f his penciI, in tracing lhe scenes of her natjve place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the operi plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; arid theri, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impresslon upon her mind, would tell him allthe supernatural tales of her riurse.Her earnestness and apparent bolief of what she riarrated, exoited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she tald him the tale of the living vampyre,who had passedyears amidst his fricnds, and dearest ties, foreed every year, by foeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he alteinpted to laugh her out of \u017fuch idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who hcld at last detected 0ne li ving among themselves, after seueral of their near relatives clnd children had been found marked with the \u017ftamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had heen, remarked, that those who had dared to questlon thejr existence, always hod some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreakjng, to confefs it was true. She detaiIed to him the traditiorial appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at lhe sametime he wondered atthc many coincidences which had all tended to exoite a hellef in the supernatvral power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to clttaohhimself more and more lo Iclnthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtue\u017f of the women among whom he had sought for hls vision af romanoe, wori his heart; and while be ridiculod tbe idea of a young man of English habil\u017f, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he faund himsolf more and moro attached to thc almo\u017ft fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins arourid him, wbilst in his mirid he relained cln image that seemed alone lhc rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and wcls ever the same frank infantilc belng he had firsl known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it wos because she had no longer any 0ne with wbom she could visit her favovrite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupicd in sketching or uncovering some frclgment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject af Vampyres, and they both, wjth several prefent, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very nome. Soon after, Aubrey detcrmined t0 proceed vpon one of his excursions, whicb was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the pIoce, they all at once begged of him not t0 rcturn at night, as he must riecessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would cver remain, clfter the day had elofed, upon any considercltion. They deseribed it as the resort of thc uampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impendirig upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their represenlations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made lheir blood freeze, ho was silent.\nNoxtmorning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprjsed to observo the melancholy face of his host, and wa\u017f concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief ofthose borrible fiends, had inspired them wlth such terror. When he wos a6out to dopart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of tbese beings to be pul in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did nol perceive that day-light would soon end, and that iri thc horizon therc wa\u017f one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted coun try.\u2014He at last, hawever, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too lale. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost uriknawn; immediately the sun sets, nigbl begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced lts way through lhe canopying foliage, whilst the blue forkcd lighlning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourh0od of a hovcl that hardly listed ilself vp from the masses of dead leclves and brushwood which surroundod lt. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to o6tain shelter froin lhe pelting of the storm. As he approached, thelhunderf, for a moment silenl, allowed him toheor the dreadfulshrieks of a woman mirigling wilh thc stifled, exu1lant mockery of a laugh, coritinued in one almost uribroken s0und;\u2014he was slartled: but, rovsed by tho thundcr which again rolled over bis head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He sound himself jn uttcr darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceivcd; for, though he called, still the sounds oontinved, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, wham he immediately feized; when a voice cried, \"Agairi baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he fell himself grappled by one whose ftrenglh seemed superhuman: determined to sell bis 1ise as dearly af he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from hi\u017f feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw hlmself upon him, and kneeling upon his hreast, had pIaced his hands upon his throclt\u2014when the glare of many torchcs penotrating through the hole that gave light ln the day, disturbed him;\u2014he iristantly rose, and, leoving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crasbing of the hranches, as he broke thr0ugh the wood, was no longer heard. Tbe storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by tbose without. They entcre d; thc light of their torches fellupon tho mud wallf, and tbe thatch loaded on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot.At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he wcls againleft in darkness; but what was his horrar, when lhe light of the torches once more b urst upon bim, to peroeive the airy form of his fair canductress braught jn a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wos but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; bul he again saw the same sorm, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet tbere was a stillness ahout her fcloe that scemed almost as attacbing as the life that once dwolt thore:\u2014upon ber neck and breast was blo0d, and upori her throat were the marks of leeth having opened thc vein:\u2014to this the meri pointed, crying, simullaneously ftruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qujckly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had latcly been to him tbo object of so many brigbt and f airy visions, now fallen witb the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind wasbenumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and take rcfuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsci0usly in his hand a naked dagger of a particulclr construetion, which had 6een found in the hut. They were soan metby different parties who had been engaged in the searoh os her whom a mother had missed. Tbeir lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To desc rjbe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of thoir child's dcath, they looked at Aubrey, and pointod to the corse. They were inconsoIable; both died brokon-hearted.\nAu6rey boirig put lo bed was seized with a moft vlolent fever, and was often delirious; ln these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some vnaccountable coinbination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare tbe being he loved. At other times he would imprecate malediction\u017f upon his hoad, and curse him os her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whalever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered froin his delirium, he was horrified and stclrtled at the sight of him whose image he had riow oombined wilh that of a Vampyre; bul Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentancc for tbe fault that had caused their separation, and still inore by the attention, arixiety, and core which he showed, soon rcconcjled him t0 his presence. His lordship seemed qujte changed; he no longer appeared thot apclthetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but cls s0on as hjf convalesconce began to be rapid, he again graduaI1y retired lnto the \u017fame stote of mind, and Aubrey percelved rio differencc from the former man, exccpt that at times he was surprised to meet hi\u017f ga2e fixed jntently upon him, with a smile of maliciovs exu1tation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the inualid's recovery, Lord Rvtbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wave\u017f raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of lhose orbs, clrcling, like our world, the moveless svn;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and lhat elasticjty of spirit which had once so distinguishod him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but mvch as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find jt jn tho neighbourhood of Athons; if he s ought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly frequerited, Ianthe's form stood by his fide\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her Iight step would appeclr wclndering amjdst theunderwood, in quest of thc inode st violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, hor pale face and wounded lhroot, with a meek smlle upon her lips. He delermined to fly scenes, every feclture os which created such bitter associations jn his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, ta whom he held him\u017felf bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they sbould visil those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They traue1led in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attoched: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seomed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mucb of robbers, but they gradually began to s light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of iridividuals, whose interest it was to exoite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretonded dclngers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of lhe inhabitants, on one occasiori they lravelled with only a few guards, more to serve a\u017f guides than as a deferiee. Upon entcring, howevcr, a narrow defile, at the boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, withlarge masses of rock brought down fromthe neighbourlrig prec ipices, they hcld reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pclss, when tbey were ftartled by tbe whistling os bul1ets clase to their heads, ond by the echoed report af several guns. In an instont their guards had left them, and, placing themsclves behind rocks, had begun tosire in thc direction whence tbe report came. Lord Ruthven and Auhrey, imitating tbeir example, retired for a moment behind lho sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus dctained by a foe, who with lnsvlting shouts bade them advance, and being exp0sed to unresistlng slavghter, if any of lhe robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined al once to rush forward in fcarch 0f the enemy. Hclrdly bad theylost the shelter of tbe rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfislance; and, na longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was saon surprised by seeing the robber\u017f' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Rvthven's being waunded, immediately thrown up their arms arid surrendered.\nBypromises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cclbin; clnd havjng agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by tbeir presence\u2014they being contenl rnerely to guard the entrance till tbeir c0mrade sbould return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's slrength rapidly decreased; in two days morlificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty ftcps. Hif conduct and appearance bcld nol changed; he \u017feemed as unconsci0us of pain af be had been of the objects about him: but t0wards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye osten fjxed upon Avbrey, who was indvced lo offor his assistance with more than usua1 earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may sovc me\u2014you may do more tbari lhat\u2014I mean not my llfe, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's horiour.\"\u2014\"H0w? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need hut littIe\u2014my life obbs apace\u2014I cannat explain the whole\u20146ut if you would conceal oll you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's rnouth\u2014and is my death werc unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried thedying man, ralsing himself with exu1tant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature sears, swear that, for cl year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my cr imes or death to any living being in any way, whaleuer may happen, or whalever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemedbursling from their sockets: \"I swear!\" sclid Aubr-\ney; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no inore.\nAubrey retired to rest, but djd not sleep; the many eircumftances attending his acquaintarice with this man r0se upori his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath acold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible clwailing him. Rjsing early in the morning, he was obout to enter the hovel in which he had left lho corpse, when a robber met him, arid informed hlm that it was no longer there, havjng been conveyed by himself and cornrades, upon his retiring, ta the pinnacIe of a neighbouring movnt, according to cl prornise they bad given his lordship, that il should be exposed to the first cold ray of the rnoon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determinedto go and bury lt upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the svmmit he found no trace of eltber the corpso 0r the cIothes, though the robbers swore they polnled out the identjcal r0ck on which they had laid the body. For a timo his mind was bewildered in conje ctures, bvt he at last returned, convjriced that they had burjed the corpsefor the sake of the clothes.\nWoary of a counlry in which he had mel with such terrible missortunes, and in whjch all apparently conspired to heighten thatsuperstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he resoIved to leave it, and soon arrived at Sinyrna. Wbjle waiting for a vessel to c onvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging t0 Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbingf there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adap ted to ensure the deatb of the victim. There were several dclggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and oxamining tbeir curious forms, whal was hls surprise at finding a sbeath apparently ornamented in the same styIe as the dagger discouered in the fat al hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening lo gain furlher proof, he found the weapon, and his horror rnay bc imagined when he discovered that it fitted, thoughpeculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in hif hand. His eyes seemed to need rio further certainty\u2014they seemcd gazingto be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished lo disbelieve; but the pclrticular form, the same varying tinls upori the haft and sheath were alike in splendour ori botb, and left rio room for doubt; there were aIso drops of blood ori each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, clt Rome, hls first inquiries were coricerning the lady he bad attempted t0 snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distross, their fortune ruined, and she had n0t been heard of since the departure of hjs lordsbip. Aubrey's mind became almast broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to tbe destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he wcre going to save the lifc of some one hc hcld dear. He arrived at Calais; a breezc, whioh \u017feemed obedlent to hif will, soon wafted him t0 the Eng1ish shores; and he hasteriod to tbe mansion of his fathers, and therc, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and caresses of hls sister, all memory of the past. If shc before, by her infantine caresses, hod gainedhis affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a eompanion.\nMiss Aubrey bad not that winning grace which gains lhe gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exjsts lri the heated atmosphere of a crowdedapartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by thc levity of tbe mind heneath. There was a melancholy charm obout it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some fceling within, that clppeared to indicale a soul conseious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays wherc'er a 6utterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smilo of joy; but whcn her brother hreathed to hcr his affection, arid would in her presence forget those gricfs she knew deftroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for tbat os the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014lhat face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not 6een preserited to the world, it hauing been thavght by hcr guclr dianf more fit that her presentation should 6e delayed unti1 hcr brother's return from the continerit, whcn he might bo her protector. It was now, therefore, reso1ved that the noxl drawing-room, whieh was fast approaching, shovld be tbe epoch of her entry int0 lhe \"busy scenc.\" Aubrey would ra ther have remained in tbe rnansion of hls fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. Ho could n0l feel iriterest abaut the frivolities of fashionablo strangers, when hjs injnd had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; bvt he deterinined to sacrifice his own comfort to tbe pr0tection of his sisler. They soon clrrived in town, and prepared for the noxt day, which had been announccd as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was exoessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thltber. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was \u017ftanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in tho remembranoe that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthveri was in that very plaee\u2014he felt him\u017felf suddenly seizod by lhe arm, and a voice he rec0gnized tao well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remembcr your oath.\" He had hardIy courago t0 turn, fearful of seeirig cl spectre that would blast him, when he percejved, at a litlle distance, the same figure which had attracted hif notice on this spot upon his first entry int0 socicty. He gazed tlll his limbs almost refu\u017fing to beclr their woig-\nht, he waf o6liged to take the clrm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himfelf into his carriage, and wos driven home. He paced the r0om with hurried steps, and fixed bis hands upon hi\u017f head, as if he were afraid his thougbts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rulhven agairi beforehim\u2014cjrcumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He rouscd himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his i mclgination had coniurcd up theimoge his mind was resting upon. It was imp0ssible that it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again int0 society; for though ho attempted to ask conceming Lord Ruthven, the name bung upon his lips, and he cauld not succeed in gaining insormation. He went o few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his 0wn devouring thougbt\u017f. Perceiving, at last, that mony were lcaving, he roused bimself, and oritoring another room, found his sister svrrovnded by several, apparenlly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near ber, when onc, whom be requested to mov e, turned round, and revcaled to him tbose features he mast abhorred. He sprang forward, seizcd his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, foroed her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dclre to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey 6ecame almost distracted. If beforc his mind had been absorbed by one subject, h0w much more complete1y was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pre\u017fsed upon his thoughtf. Hi\u017f \u017fister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what hcld caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, ond thosc terrified her. The more he thought, the m0re he was bewildered. His aath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breatb, amidst al1 be held dear, and not avert its progress? His vcry si\u017fter mighthavc been touchcd by him. But even if he were to breakhis oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would belieue him? He thought of employing his own hand to froe the world from such a wretch; hut death, he remembered, had been already mocked. F0r days he remainod in this ftate; shut up in his room, he sow no one, and ate only when bjs sister came, who, witb eyes ftreaming with tears, besought bim, for her sake, to suppart nature. At last, no longer capable of beclring stillness and solitvde, he 1est his hause, roomed from street to street, anxious to f1y that image wbicb haunted him. Hi\u017f dress became rieglccted, and he wandered, as osten exposed t0 the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer ta be recogni2ed; clt first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for bif safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him wbo fledfrom a pursuer swifter than any\u2014fram thought. His conduct, bowever, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of bis friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were uncanscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiovs to forewarn, in spile of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimclcy. But whon he enlered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which afsected him so strongly. When, howevor, rernonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians th0ugbt proper lo interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again tbat trust which had been before imposed upon them by Avbrey's parerits.\nDesirous of saving hiin from the injurics and sufferings he had daily encountered ln his wanderings, and of preventing him froin exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they erigaged a physician t0 reside in the h0use, and tako coristant care 0f him. He hardly appeared t0 notice it, so complotely was hjs mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incohercnce beeame at last so great, that he wos confjned lo hif chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a gla\u017fsy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and rcco1lection remaining displayed itse1f upon the entry of his sisler; tben he would somctjines start, and, sei2ing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do nol touoh him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do nol go near him!\" When, however, she iriquired to whom he reserred, his only onswer was, \"True! true!\" orid again he sank into a state, whonce nol even she could rovse him. This Iasted many months: gradually, hawever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion af its gloom, whilst his guardians obscrved, that scveral times in the day he would caunt upon hif fingers a definite numbor, and then srnil e.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, vpon the last doy of the year, one of his guardians eritering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy oircumstance of Aubrey's beirig in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Iristantly Aubrey's ottention was attracted; he asked onxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returnjrig inteIlect, os which they foared he had been deprjved, they montianed the name of tbe Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in sooiety, Aubrey seemed pleascd, and astonished them \u017ftill more by his expressing bis intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. Thoy answered not, but in ofew minuteshis sister was with him. He was apparently agcljn capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his hreast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at tho thought of her brother's being once more aliveto the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid every acoomplishmcnt; when he suddcnly perceived a lockot upon her breast; opening it, what wos his surprise at beholding the features os the monster who had fo long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in o paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon hor askirig him why he thus destroyed the refemblance of her fvture husband, he looked as if hc did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expresslon of countenarice, he bade her swear lhat she would nevor wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014il seemed as if that v0ice again bade him remember bis oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whoIe, and thought lhis wa\u017f but a return of his disorder, entcred, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to loave him. Ho fell vpon his knees to them, he implorod, he hegged as them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanlty they imagined had token possession of his mind, endeavoured lo pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rulhven had called the moming after tbe drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he hoard of Aubrey's ill heallh, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when be learned that ho was deemed jnsane, his exvltation and pleasure could hardly be concealed srom those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the 6rother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who covld resist bis power? His tonguo had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an iridividual havjng no sympathy with ony being ori the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himsels;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely tbat he migbt listen to her soolhing accents;\u2014iri fine, he kriew so well how to use lho serpent's art, or such was the will of fatc, thot he gained ber af fections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtajncd an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her hrother's deranged state,) which was lo tclke place the very day before hif departure for the contirient.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physicionand hi\u017f guardians, altempted to bribe the scrvants, but in vain. He asked for pen and pclper; it was given him; he wrolea letter ta hjs sister, eonjvring her, os she valued her own bclppinoss, her own honaur, and the honour of lhose now in the grave, who anoe held her in their arms as their hope and thc bope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marrjage, on which he denounced tbe most beavy curses. Tbe servants promised they would deliver il; 6ut giving it ta the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the h ouse; clnd Aubrey heard, wilh a horror that moy more easily be conceived than described, the notef of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carrjages br0ke upon bis ear. Auhrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcarne lheir vigilarice, lhey gradually st0le away, leaving him inthc custody of an helpless 0ld woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the ro0m, and in cl moment faund himself ln the apartment where aIl were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approacbed, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from theroam, speechless with rag e. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your aath, and know, if not my bride to doy, yovr sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his altendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was convoyed to 6ed. This was not montioried to his sister, wh0 was not present when be entered, as thc physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the brlde and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood prodvced symptoms af the near approclch os death. He desired hi\u017f sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died iinmediately after.\nTho guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; bvt wben they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's siftcrhad glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCDUNT OF LORD BYRDN'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wcls all beforo him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence hif guide.\"\nIN Sailing througb tbe Grccian Archipelago, on board one of his Mcljesty's vessels, in lhe year 181z, we put irito the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pIace, and the certain \u017fupply of cattle and vegetables a1ways to be had there, induce mariy British ves sels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather ovt of the track sor ships bound lo Smyrna, its bounties amply repay farthe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottam of lhe bay, and whilst the rnen were emplayed in waterlng, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nalives, the clergymari and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer'\u017f School, and olher places, where we hod been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (cl fmall monticule so narned) we met with and engaged o young Groek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island saur days prcvious to our arrivaI in his felucca. \"He cngaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me wilh him; 6ut I did not choose to quit Mltylene, where I clm likely to get married. He was an odd, but a vory good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the rivor, belongs to him, and he has lcft an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and haf resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails iri his felucca very aften to the different islands.\"\nTbis accourit excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in hastening to the haufo where 0ur countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over tbe mansion. It consisted of four apclrtments on the ground-floor\u2014on entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were clll simplydecorated: plain grecn-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in lhe centre, and a smaIl souritain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches 6y movirig a spring fixed in the side of a sma1l bron2e Venvs jn a leanjng pasture; a large couch or s0fa completed the furnitvre. In the hall stood hals a dazeri EngIish cclnechairs, and an empty book-casc: tbere were no mirrors, nor a single pairiting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on tho floor, with two stuffed colton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, forrnerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which wcre then in a large seaman's chest iri the closet: it was open, 6ut we did not think oursolves justified in examining lhe contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, ond Rousseou's warks comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empjres; Zimmermori, jn the G erman language; K1opstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's noveIs; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Parcldise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, muoh t0rn, but no English book of any description. Most of lhese books were filled with marginal notes, written with cl pencil, in Italicln and Latln. The Messiah was literally scribhled all over, and mclrked with slips of paper, an which also wero romarks.\nThe ald man said: \"The lord had bcen reclding these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot ta pla ce thcm with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie vntil his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways vcry goad. I once did him a service; and I have the pr0dvce of this farm f0r the trouble of la king care of it, exoept twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom tbe lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reasori.\"\nThe appeclrance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fovrteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars witb black pIinths and fret-work carnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architccture,) wcre consjderably higher thcln the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stono halustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey corpet, beneath anawning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops aro thus furnished, as upon thcm the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking ligbt wines, such as \"lclchryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjoying the evenjng breeze.\nOn the 1eft hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering t0gother on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtIe bushes, o marble \u017feat with an ornamental wooden back wos plaoed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talkirig to himself. \"I suppose,\" said lhe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devovl, \"arid always attended our church twice cl week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may he terined \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covercd wjth olive and myrlle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing froin the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the movntajn's baso. The sea srnooth as glass, and an horizori unshadowed by a singlc cloud, lerminates the view in front; and a little on the left, througb a v ista of lofty cbesnut and paIm-lrees, several srnal1 islands woro distinotlyobserved, studdjng the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; bvt our enquiries were fruitlcss asto the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew bis name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our coriductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannol you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eigbt young girls when he was last upon the i\u017fland, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by woaving these articles. He also hought a new boat for o fisherman who had lost bis own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamentf to the poor children. In short, he appoared to us, from clIl we eollected, to have beeno very ecceritrjc and berieuolent character. One circumstarice we learnt, which our 0ld friend at the eottclge thought proper not to disclose. Hehad a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seeri walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which wedeparted from the peaceful isle af Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessjng who thls rambler in Greece cauld be. He had money it was evident: he had phllanthropy of dispositiori, and all lhose eocontricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in c0mpany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil os WYATT'S, who hcld been traveIling in Egypt and Greece, \"Tbe individual,\" sald he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's farne, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Hclrolde\" being pul into ovr hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not baving been more eurious in our researches al the cottage, but we corisoled ourselves with the idea os returning to Mitylene on sorno future day; but to me that day wilI riever return. I make this statement, be1ievjng lt not quite unintcresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has becn grossly slaridered. He has been described as of an unseeling dispositi0n, averse to ossociating with human nature, or cantributing in any way to so0th its sorrows, or add t0 its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as rnoy be plainly gathered srom these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderncss, syinpathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: ond his co urting lhe repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a boing on whose heart Religiori hath set her seol, and over whose hoad Berievolence hath thrown her rnantle. No man con read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feclirig proud of him as a countryman. Wilh respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not asfume a right to give an opiniori. Reports are ever to be received with caution, partieularly wheri directed against man's moral integrity; and he who daref justify himself before that awful tribunal wbero all must a ppear, alone may censure the errors of a feIlow-martal. Lord Byron's character is w0rthy of hjs geriiu\u017f. To do good jn secret, and shun the world's o pplause, is the svre\u017ft testimony of a virtvous hearl and self-approving conscionce.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","25":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Ta1e.\nBy John Williain Polidori\nTHE suporstitlon vponwhich this lale is founded is very general in the Eclst. Among the Arabians it appeclrs to bo common:it did not, however, extend itsels to the Greeks until after the establisbmont of Christiariity; and it has only assumed its present forrn since tbe division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalenl, that a Lcltin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradva1ly increased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. In the West it spreod, with s0me slight varialion, a1l ovcr Hungary, Poland, Austrio, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly jmbibed a cerlain porlion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strerigth, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these hvman blood-suokers fattened\u2014and their veins hecame distended to such a state of repletian, as lo cavse the blood to flaw fromall the passages of their bodios, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nInthe Loridon Journal,of March, l732, is o curious, and, of courfe, credible account of a particular ease of vampyrism, wbich is slaled to have occurred at Mcldreyga, ln Hungary. It appoars, that upon cln examinalion of the commander-in-chief and rnagiflrates of the place, they positlvely and unanimously affirmed, that, about five yeors before, a certairi Hcyduke, riamed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia,on the frontiersof the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating somo of the earth out of the vampyre's grclve, and rubbing himsels with hjs blood. Thls precaution, however, dld not prevent him from beeoming a vampyre himself; for, abovt t wenty or thirty days afler his dealh and burial, many persons complained of having been tormerited by hiin, and a deposition wos made, that four persons had been dcprived of life by his attacks. To provent further mischief, the inbabitants having consulted their Hadagni, toak up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emittlng at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proos hauing been thus obtained, they resorted to lbe clccustomed roinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported lo havc cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This dane, they cut off his head, hurned his body, and threw the asbes into his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died fram vampyrism, Iest they should, iri the ir turri, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief i\u017f, that a person sucked by a vclmpyre bocomes a vampyre himsels, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis moristrouf rodomontade is hero related, becaufe it seerns better adapted to illustrato the subject of the presont observations thari any other instance which could be cldduced. Iri many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishment after death, for some heirious erime committed whilst in existenco, thal the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his jnferna1 visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon cclrth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affeclion.\u2014A suppofition alluded to in the \"Giclour.\"\nBut first on earth, a\u017f Vampyre sent, Thy corse shaIl from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the riative place, And suck the bloodof all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At rnidnight drain tho slream of life; Yet loathe thc banquet which perforce Must feed thy livjd living corfe, Thy victjm\u017f,ere they yet expire, Sball know tho deinon for their sire; As cursing thoe, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. Bvt one tbat for thy crime must fall, The y0ungest, best beloved of all, Shall 6less thec with a fclther's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet lbou must ond thy task and mark Her cboek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spork, And the 1ast gla\u017fsy glclnce must view Which sreeze\u017f o'er its lifeless blue; Then withunhallowed hand shall tear The tresses 0f her ycllow hair, Of which, in life a lock when sborn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is barne away by thee Memoria1 of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and hclggard lip; Then stalking to thy sulIen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls andAfrils rave, Till these in horror shririk away From speclre inore accursed than tbey.\nMr. Soulhey has alsa introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\"the vampyre oorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havlng returned from lhe grave for the purpose of tormenting him she besl loved whilst in exislence. But this cannot be svpposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale asa complcte type of purity and jnnocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his traveIs of \u017feveral astonishing cases of vampyrism,l0 which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Ca1met, in his greal work upon this subject, besides a vari ety of anecdotos, and traditionary narralives illuslrative of its efsects, has put forth some learned dissertcltions, tending to prove it ta be a classical, as well as barbarjan error.\nMariy curious and interesting notiees on thi\u017f singularly borri6lo fuperstition might be added; though the presenl may suffice for tbe limitf of a note, neeessarjly devoted to explanaljan, clnd which may now be concluded hy merely remarking, that though the termVampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are severa1 others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts of tbe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeriod that in the inidst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of tbe leaders of the ton a nableman, m0re remarkable for his singularities, than hif rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laugbtor 0f the fair only attracted hisattcntion, that he might by a look quell il, and thr0w fear into those breasls where thoughtlessnesf reigned. Thofe who felt this scrisation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it t0 the deod grey cye, which, fixing upon tbe object's f ace, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to picrce thr0ughto the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a lea den rcly that weighed upon the skin it could not pclss. His peculiarities caused bim to be invited to every housc; all wished to sec him, and those who had been clccustomed to violent exciternent, and now felt the weigbt of ennui, were plcased at havingsomething in their presence capable of engaging their atlention. Iri spite af the doodly hueof his face, which never goined a warmer tint, eithcr from the blush of modesty,or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beauliful, mariy of the female hunlers after notoriety altempled to win his attentions, arid gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had beeri the mockery of every monster shewnin drawing-rooms since her marriage, tbrew herself in hisway, and did all but put on tbe dress of a mountebank, to attract hjs notice:\u2014though in vairi:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as lf they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence wa\u017f baffled, and she left lhe field. But though the cammon adullress could not influence even tho guldance of his eyes, it was not that the femalo sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tbe apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innoccnt daughter, thal few knew he euer addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winnirig tongue; ond whether it was that jt even overcame the dread of his singular eharacter, or that they were moved by hjs apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domcslio virtues, cls among those who \u017fu1ly it by theirvice\u017f.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentIemon of the name of Aubrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in the posfe\u017fsion of great wealth, by porents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to tclke care of his fortvne, while they relinquished the more jmportant charge os his rnind to lhe care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated m0re his imaglnation than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic fecling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so manymilliners' apprentices. He believed al1 to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown jri by Providence merely for the picturesqve ef fect of the scene, as we see in rornances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in tbe vesting of clotbes, which werc as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various ooloured patches. He lhoughl, in firie, that tho dreams of poetf were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circlos, inany mothers surr0unded him, striving which shovld describe with least truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters ot the same time, hy their brlghtoning countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merlt. Attachcd as he was to the romance os his salitary h0urs, he was slartled at finding, lhat, except in tbc talI0w and wax candlcs that flickered, notfrom the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no fouridation in real lifo for any of that congeries os pleasirig piclures and descriptions contained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, howover, somc compensation in his gratified vanity, he was abaut to rclinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have abovedescribed, crossed him in his careor.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibilityof forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few olher signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existonce, impliod by the avoidance of thcir contclct: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that fIatterod lts propensity ta extravagant ideas, he so0n forined lhisobject into the hero of a romance, and determined lo observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before hlm. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so sar odvanced upon his notlce, tbat his presence was always rec0gnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from thenotes 0f preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was clbout to travel. Desirous of gaining fome informatian re\u017fpocting this singular character, wh0, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardions, that il was time for him to perfarm the tour, which for many generations has beeri lhougbt nocessary to enahle the young to take some rapid steps in tbe career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if sallen from thc \u017fkies, whenever scondalous irilrigues are mentioned os the subjects of p1easantry or os praise, clccording to the degrec of skill shewn iri carrying them on. They corisented: and Aubrey immediately inentianing his jntentjons to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to recoive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with otber men, he gladly accepted it, and jn a few days they had passed tbe circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, thal, thaugb many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the re\u017fults offered difserent conclvsionf from the apparerit motives to hls conduct. His componion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, lhe vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than en0ugh to relleve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not avoid romarking, that it was notupon the virtuous, reducod to lndigence 6y the misforlunes attendant even upon uirtuc, tbat he beslowed hjs alms;\u2014these were scnt from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask \u017fomething, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still doeper in his iniqvlty, bc was sent away with rich charity. This was, hawever, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generallyprevails over tho retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity of his Lord\u017fhip, which waf still moro impressed upon his mind: all those upon wh0m it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for thoy were aIl either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most clbject misery. At Brussels and otherlowns through which they pa\u017fsed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerriess with which his companiori sought f0r the oentres of all foshionable vice; there he entered irito all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gombled with svcce\u017fs, except where tbe known sharper was hls ontagonist, and then he lost cven more than he gained; but it was always with the same uncbanging face, with which he generally watched lhe society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered tberosh youthful novice, or the luckless fathcr of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortuno's lclw\u2014this apparent abstrclctedness of mind wos laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with morc fire than that of tbe cat whilft dallyjng with the half-dead mouso. In every town, he left the formerly affluont youth, torn from the circlc he adorried, cursing, in tbe foljtude of cl dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whil\u017ft inany a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewith to buy even suffioient to satisfy their preferit craving. Yot he took no money from the garnbling lab1e; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the inriocent: this might but be the result of a certain degrce of knowledge, wbich was not, however, capable of combating lhe cunning of the more experiericed. Aubroy often wi\u017fhed to represent this to his friend, and bog him to resign thal charjly and pleasure whioh proved the ruin of all, and didnot tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for eoch day he ho ped his sriend would give him some opportunity of speaking frarikly and openly to hiin; however, this never occurred. Lord Rulhven in his carriage, and amidst tbe various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spake Iess than his lip; and though Aubrcy wos near the object of his curiosity, ho ohtainod no greater gratification from it thari the constant excitement of vain1y wishing to breclk that mystery, which to his oxalted imagjnaliori began lo asfume the appearance of something supernatura1.\nThoy soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of hls companion; he lefl him in daily attendance upon tbe morriing circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in \u017fearch of the memoriclls os another almost de\u017ferted cily. Whilst hewa\u017f thus engaged, lelter\u017f orrived fram England, wbioh he operied wilh eager impatience; the first was srorn his sisler, breathing riothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter ostonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagination that there was an evjl power reside nt in hif eompanion, these seemed lo give bim sufflciont reasori for the belief. His guardians insisled upon his jmmedjately leavirig his friend, clnd urged, tbat his character was dreadfully vicious, for thclt the p0ssession of irresistible p0wers of sedvction, rendered his licentious habits more dongerous to society. It had been discovered, that bis contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to en hance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of hjs guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsvllied virtvo, down to the lowest abyss of infomy and degradati0n: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on occount of their virtue, had, since bis departvre, thrown even tbe mask aside, and had nol scrupled to expose the whole desormity of thcir vicos to lhe public gaze.\nAubroy determined upon leaving one, wh0se character had not yet shown a finglc bright point on which to reft the eye. He resolved to inventsome p1ausible prelext for a6andoning bim altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no fllght circumstances pass by unnoticed. He ent-\nered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavovring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with iri society; hewas thcrefore obliged to carry on his plclns in sccret; bul Auhrey's eye f0llowod him in all his wjndings, and soon discovered lhat an a\u017fsignation had been appointod, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though th0ughtless girl. Losing no tjme, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked bim his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at lhesame time that he was aware of his being about t0 meet her that very riigbt. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an accasion; and upon being prcfsed whether he iritended to marry ber, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writlrig a note, lo say, that from that moment be must dcc1ine accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of the ir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other opartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of oll hc knew, nol only with regard l0 her daughter, but als0 concerning the characler of his Lordship. The assignation was prevcnted. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant lo notify his complete assent to a sepclration; but did not binl any svspicion of his plans ba ving heen foiled by Aubrey's lnterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and cro\u017fsing the Peninsvla, soon fovnd bimself at Athenf. He lhen fixed his residence in lhe house of a Greek; and soori occupied him\u017felf in tracing the faded records os ancient glory upon monvments tbat apparently, asbamed os chronicling tbe deeds of freemen only bef0re slaves, had hidden themselvo\u017f bcneath tbe sheltering sojl or rnany coloured ljehen. Under lhe same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she rnighl have formed the modcl for a painter wisbing to pourtray on canvoss the promised hape of the faithful in Mahomet's poradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind sor any one to think sho could bolorig to those who hcld no sovls. As she danced upontbe plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchariged her eye, apparcntly the eye of animated nature, for that \u017fleepy luxur ious look of the anlmal suited bul to the tasto 0f an epicure. The Ilght step of Ianthe often accompclnied Aubrey in his search clfter antiquitjes, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in lhe pursuit of aKashmere 6uttersly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon lhe wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the Ietters be had just dccypbered upon an alrnost effaced tablet, in lhe contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofton would her tresses falling, as she flitted ar0und, exhibit in the sun's ray such deljcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulriessof the antiquary, who letescape from his mlnd the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, hut none con appreciate?\u2014It wcls innoccnce, youth, and beauty, unaffected 6y crowded drawing-roamf and stifling balls. Wbilst he drew those rcmains os which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future bours, she would stand by, ond watch the magjc effects of his pencil, in traoing the scenes of her native ploce; sbe would then dcscribe t0 him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours as youthful rnemory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewirig in her lnfancy; and then, tuming to svbjectf thathad evidently made a greater jmpression upon her mind, would tell hlm all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earneslne\u017ff and apparent bellef of what she narrated, excited the interest euen of A ubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vclmpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the lise of a l0vely feincl1e to prolong his existonce for thc ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out os such idle and horrible fantasies; bvt Ianthe cited to hjm the name\u017f of old men, who had at 1ast detected one living among themselves, aftor several of thoir near relotives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wheri fhe found him so ineredulous, she begged of hlm to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to qvestion their existence, always had some proof giuen, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to canfefs it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, arid his borror was incrcased, by hearing a pretty accvrate description of Lord Ruthuon; he, h owever, still persisted iri persuadirig her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though atlhe same time he wondered at the many caincidences which had a1l tended to excite a belief in the supornatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach hi mself more and more to Ianthe; her innocenco, so contrasted with all the affected virlues of the womcn among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hif heclrt; and while hc ridiculed the idea os a youngman of English habit s, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himse1f m0re clnd more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He wou1d tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some clntiquarian rosearch, he would depart, determined not to return until his abject was attained; but he olways found it impossible to fix bis attention vpon the ruins around him,whilst in his mind heretained an image that seemed alone lhe rightful possessor of his thoughts. Iantho was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infontile bcing he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it wcls because she had no longer any one with whom she covld visit her favovrite haunts, wbilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering somo fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pa1e with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined ta proceed upon one of his cxcursi0ns, which was to detain him for o few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not t0 return at night, as he must neocssarily pass through a wood, where no Grcek would ever remain, after the day bad closed, upon any consideration. They descrihed it as the resort of lhe vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the m0st heavy evils as impending up0n him whodclred to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, the very name of which apparently made tbeir blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy foce of his host, and wa\u017f coricerned lo find that hif words, maoking the belief of those horrible fiend\u017f, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe caine to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the pawer of these beingst0 be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his refeorch, that he did not perceive that day-light wouId soon end, and that ln the hori2on there wcls one of those specks wbich, in the wclrmer climates, so rapidly gather into o tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, howeuer, mounted his horse, determiried to mclke up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fets, night begins: and ere he had advoncod far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an irilervaI of re st\u2014its thick heauy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall clnd radiate al his vory feet. Suddenly his bor se look fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through tho enlarigled forest. The animal at last, through fatiguc, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the rieigbbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and hrushwood which furrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one t0 guide him to the lown, or at 1east tru\u017fting to obtain shelter from the pelting af the storrn. As he approached, the thunders, for a momcrit silent, clllowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mookery of a laugh, continued in one alm0st unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, soroed open the door of the hut. He fourid himself jn utter dclrkne\u017ff: the s0und, however, gujded him. He was apparent1y unperceived; for, though he called, ftill the sounds continued, and rio nolice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immedicltely seized; when a uoice eried, \"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and be felt himself grappIed by orie whoso strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell hi\u017f life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but jt wa\u017f in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled wilh enorm0us force ogainst the ground:\u2014his enemy throw himsolf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon bis thr oat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating throvgh the hole that gave light in the dcly, disturbed hlm;\u2014he instantly rase, and, leaving his proy, rushed through the door, and in a momerit lhe crashing of the branehes, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The slorm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soori heard by those withaut. They entered; the light of tbeir torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded ori every indjvidual straw with beavy flakos of soot. At the dcsire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attractcd him by her cries; he was agairi left in darkncss; bvt what was his horror, when the light os the torchos once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his foir conductress brought in a ljfeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw thesamo sorin, when he vnclosed them, stretched by his side. There was nocolour vpon her check, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacbing as the life that 0nce dwelt there:\u2014vpon her neckand breast was blood, and upon her tbroot were the marks af teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying,simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by tbe side of her who had lalely boen to him the object of so mariy bright and f airy visions, now fallen with the flower of llfe that had died withiri her. He knew not what his th0ughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed ta shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a parlicvIar construction, wblchhad been found in the hut. Thcy wore soon met by difserent partie\u017f who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mothcr had missed. Their lame ntabIe crjes, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of somo dreadful eatastrophe. \u2014To describe thcir grief would be impossible; but when they asoertained the cause of thcir ehjld's death, they Iookod at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey boing put to bed was seized with a mast vio1ent fever, and wos often deIirious; in these interval\u017f hc would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iclnthc\u2014by some unaccountable combinatlon he seemed to beg of his former componion to spare the being he loved. Al other times ho would imprecate mclledictions upon his head, and cur\u017fe him as ber destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chariced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upori hearing of the state of Aubrey, immodiately placed himself in the same house, arid becaine hjs constant attendant. When the latter recovered fr0m his dolirium, he was horrified and startled clt the sight of him whoso image he had now combined with thclt of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by hi\u017f kind words, implying almost ropentance for the fault that had cclu\u017fed thelr separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconcilod him to hjs presence. His lordship seemed quite c hanged; he no longer appeared that apathelio being wbo had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as hi\u017f convalescencebegan to be rapld, he again gradually retired inta the same state of mind, and Av6roy perceived no difference from the former man, exceptthclt al times he was surprised to moet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exvltation playing upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's reeavery, Lord Ruthven wasapparent1y engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coollrig breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he oppeared to wish t0 avoid the eyes os all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waf much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which bad once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a l0ver of \u017folitvdo and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for s0litude, bis mind could not find it in the neighbourbood of Athens; if he sought it amidst tho ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by hjf side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wclndering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violot; then suddenly turning round, would show, to bis wild imagination, her pale face ond wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter oss0ciations in his mind. He prop0sed to Lord Rulhven, ta whom he held himsels bovnd by the tender care he had taken of him during his illne\u017fs, that they sbould visit those parts of Greece rieither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They beard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight the\u017fe reports, whieh they imagined were only the in vention of individuals, whose interest it was ta excite the generosity os lhose whom they defended from pretonded dangers. In consequenee of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a doferice. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of o torrent, with large massos of rock brought down from lhe neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scareely were the wbole os tbe party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bulIets close to thcir heads, and by the echoed report of \u017feveral guns. In an instant their guards had left tbem, and, p1acing themselves behind rocks, bad begun to firc in the directjon whenco the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilating their example, retired for a moment behind tho sheltering turri of the defile: but ashclmed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade thom advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, ifany of the robbers shouId climb above and take them in the rear, lhey determined at 0nce to rush forward in scarch 0f the enemy. Hardly had they lost lhe sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven recejved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastonedto his as\u017fistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or hls own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immedicltelythrown up their arms and surrendcred.\nBy pr0mi\u017fes of great reward, Aubrey \u017foon induoed tbem to conuey his waunded friend to a rieighbouring eabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being coritent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promiscd sum, for whicb he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly dccreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemcd advancing wlth hasty ste ps. His conduct and clppearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eyc often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer hlf assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I hoed the death of my existenee as little as that of the passing day; but you inaysaue my horiour, your friend's horiour.\"\u2014\"How? tel1 me bow?I would da any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need hut little\u2014iny lise ebbsapaoe\u2014I cannot explclin the who1e\u2014but is you would conccaI all you know of me, my bonour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in Erigland\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It s hall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rclifing himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your sou1 rcveres, by all yovr nature fears, swear thal, sor a year and a day you will not impart your knowlc dge of my crimes or death to any living being iri any way, whotever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" \u017faid Aubrey; he sunk laughjng upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; lhe many circvmsta-\nnces attending his aoquajntclnec with this man rose upon hi\u017f mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold sbivering camo over him, as is from thc presenliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enler the hovel in which hehad left the carpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having beenconveyed by himself and comrades, upon hi\u017f rotiring, to the pinnacle of a ncigbbouring mount, according to a promise tbey had given hislordship, that lt should be exposedto the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avbrey aftonished, and taking several of the men, determiried to go and bvry it upon the spot where it lay. But, whcn he had mounted to the summit he fourid no trace of either the corpse or thc clothes, lhough the robbers swore thoy poinled out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was hewildered in conjectures, but he at 1ast returned, convinced thal they had buried the corpse for the soke of the clolhes.\nWeary os a country in which he had mel with such terrible misfortune\u017f, and in which allapparently oonspired to heighten that superstitious me1ancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to 1eave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convoy him to Otranto, ar to NapIes, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him bel0nging to Lord Ruthven. Amongsl 0ther things lhere was a case conlaining several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining tbeir curious forms,what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamenled in the same style as lhe daggcr discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddercd\u2014haslening to gain fvrlher praof, he found thc weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, lhough peculiarly shaped, the shcath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound tothe dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; bvt the particular form,thc same varyirig tintsvp0n the haft and s heath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room far doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, ond on his way home, at Rome,hif first inquiries were concerning tbe lady he had attemptod to snatch from Lord Rvthven's seductive arts. Her paronts were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of sinoe the departuro of his lordship. Avbrey's mind becclme olmost broken under so mariy repeated horror\u017f; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a vietim to the destroyer of Ianthe. Hebecame morose and silent; clnd his on1y occupation consisted in urging the speed os the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Engllfh shores; and he hastened to the monsion of his sathers, and thero, for a rnoment, appeared to lose, jn the embraces and caresses of hls sjster, all mcmory of the past. If she before, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his offection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still m0re attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning graoe which gains the gaze and applauso of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of thal light brilliancy which orily exists in the heated atmosphore of cl crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seemta arisesrom missorturie, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indioate a soul consoious of a brigbter realm. Her step was nat that light footing, which st rays where'er a buttersly or a colour mcly a ttract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlenod by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her hisaffectian, and wauld ln her presence forget those grlefs she kriew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed asif those eyes,\u2014that faco were then playlng in the lightof their own native spbere. She wos yet only eightoen, arid had not been presonted to the world, it having been thought by her guardians moro fit that her preseritatjon should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should bo the epoch os her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bove remained in the rna nsion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy wbich overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionabIe strangors, when his mind had 6een so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined ta sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which bad been anriounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-rooin had not been held for a long time, and a1l who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hasteried thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was \u017ftanding in a corner by himself, heedless 0f all around him, engaged in the remembrance tbat thc first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plclce\u2014he felt himself suddonly seized by lhe arm, clnd a voice he recognized too well, sovnded in his ear\u2014\"Rernember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a \u017fpectre that would blclst him, when be perccived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attractcd bis notice on thls spot upon his first entry int0 society. He ga2ed tiIl his Iiinbs almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage lhrough the crowd,be threw himself into hiscarriage, and was drivon home. He paced the room with burried \u017fteps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as jf he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from hif brain. Lord Ruthuen agairi bofore him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadfuI array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oatb.\u2014He roused himself, be covld not believe it possih1e\u2014the dead rife again!\u2014He thought his imaginalion had coniured up the iinage his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that lt could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again inta socioly; for though ho atternptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he couldnot succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to theassombly of a near relation. Leaving her undor the protection of a motron, he retlred lnto a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thou ghts. Perceiving, at last, lhat many were leaving, he roused bimself, and entering another roorn, saund his sistor surrounded by several, apparently in eornest conversation; he clttempted to pass and get near hor, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurriedstep, forced her tawards the street: at thodoor he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waitjng for their lords; and while he waf ongaged in passing thein, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, s0on reached home.\nAubrey beoame alm0st distractod. If before his mind had been absor6ed by one subject, how much more compIetely was it engrossed, now lhat tbe certainty 0f the monster's living again pressed upon hif thoughts. His si\u017fter's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vclin that she intreatcd him to explain lo her whclt had caused his abrupt conduet. He only utte red a few words, and thofe terrified her. The more he thought, the inore he wasbewlldered. His oath startled him;\u2014waf he then to clllow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breoth, arnidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he wcre to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He lhought of employing hls own harid t0 free the world from such a wretch; buldeath, he remembered,had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he sclw no ane, and ate only when his sister camo, who, with eyes streaming witb tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support natvre. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness arid s0litudc, he lefthis house, raamed fr0m street to street, anxious to fly lhat image which hclunted him. His dress becamonegleoted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was n0 langer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; bvt al last he laid bim down to rest wherever fat igue overtook him. His sjster, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow bim; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought.His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the ldea that he left by his abscnce the whole of his friend\u017f, with a fiend amongst them, of whose pres ence tbey were unconscious, he determincd to enter agairi into society,and watch him closely, onxious to farewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached with iritimacy. Bvt wheri he entered into a roam, his haggard and suspicjous loo ks were so slriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was al last obliged to beg os him to abstain from seeking, for her \u017fake, a society whjcb affocted him so strangly. Wheri, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper lo interpofe, and, feclring that hjs mind was bec0ming alienated, they thought it high time t0 resume again that trvst which had been bef0re imposed upon them 6y Aubrey's parents.\nDesirovs of savinghim fr0m the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in hi\u017f wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the genoral eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physiciari to refide in the house, and take constant care of him. Hehclrdly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last s0 great, thot he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had bec0me emaciated, his eyes had attajned a g1assy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remaining dlsplayed itself up0n the eritry of his \u017fisler; then he would sometimos start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted ber, he would desire her not lo touch him. \"Ob, do not touch him\u2014is your love for me is aught, do not go near bim!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not everi she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences 6ecamc less frequerit, and hjs mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst bis guardians observed, tbat several times in tbe day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThetime had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day os the year, one of his guardians entering hi\u017f room,began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Auhrey's being inso awful a situation, wberi his sister was going nexl day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's clttention was attracted; he asked anxiously to w hom. Glad of this mark of roturning lntellect, of whjch thcy feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl wh0m he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention t0 be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They clnswered not, but in a sew minutes hif sister wos wilh him. He was apparenlly again capable 0f being affected by the influence of her lovely fmile; for hepressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at lhe thought of her brother's being orice more alive lo the feelings of afsection. He began ta speclk with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate ber vpon her marriage with a pcrson \u017fo dislinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprjse at behaldlng the f eatures of the monstor who had so lang influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled il under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus deslroyed the rescmblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did n0t understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazirig onher with a frantic exprcssion of countericlrice, he hade her swear that sbo would never wed this monster, sor he\u2014 But he covld not advance\u2014it scemed as if that voice agairi bade bim remember his oath\u2014be turned suddenly rovnd, thinkingLord Ruthven was near hlm but saw n0 one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, wha had beard the whole, and lhought this was but a return os his disordor, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrcy, desired her to leave him. He fell up0n his knees to lhem, he implored, he bogged of them to delay but for one day. They, ottrihuting this to the insanity they imagined had taken pos-\nsession os his mind, endeavoured ta pacify him, clnd retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after tbo drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's illhealth, he readiIy understood himself to be thc cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, hisexultation and pleasure could bardIy be concealed from tbose among whom he had gained this informatlori. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for tbe brother arid interesl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his powcr? His tongue had danger\u017f and toils to recount\u2014could speclk of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the cr0wded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014cou1d tell how, sinco he knew hor, his existence, hcld bcgun ta secm worthy of preservation, if it were inere1y that he might 1jst en to her soothing accerits;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how la use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length lo him, he obtained an important embassy, which served cls an excuse sor hasteningthe marriage, (in spite of her hr0ther's deranged state,) which was lo take placc tbe uery day bcfore his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, atlempted to hribc the seruarits, but in vain. He afked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrato a 1etter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happincss, her own bonour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arrns as their hope and the hope os their house, lo delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the most heauy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giuing it to tho pbysician, he thought it better not to harass any morc the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravlngs of a maniae. Night passed ori withoul re\u017ft to tbe busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived thcln described, the notes of busy preparatian. Mornjng came, and the \u017found of carriages br0ke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe curiosily of the servantf al last ovorcame th eir vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in lhecustody of ari helpless old woman. He soized the opportunity, with one bound wos out of the room, arid in a moinent found himseIf in the apclrtment where all worenearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approachcd, and, taking bis arm by force, hurried him from lhe rooin, speechlcss with rage. When on the staircasc, Lord Ruthuen whispered iri his ear\u2014\"Remernber your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to day, yovr fister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, hc pushed him towards his atteridants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in searoh of him. Aubrey could n0 longer support himself; hisrage nat finding vent, had broken a hlood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not menlioned to his sister, who wos not present when he entered, as the phyfician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and tho bride clnd bridegro0m lcft London.\nAubrey'f weakness increased; tbe effusion of blood praduced symptams of the near appraach of declth. He des ired his fister's guardiclns might bc ca1led, and when the midnight hour had struck, he reIated composedly whal the reader hcls perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wheri they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, arid Aubrey's sister had g1utted the thir\u017ft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT 0F LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCDUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wcls all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailingthrough the Grecian Archipelago, 0n b0ard one of his Majesty's vessels, in the ycar 1812, we pul inta tho harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. Tbe beauty of this place, and tbe eertajnsupply of catlle and vegetables aIways to be had there, induce inany British vessels t0 visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed; as usval, at the bott0m os the boy, and whilst the men were omployed in watering, and the purser bclrgaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and mysels took a ramble to the oove called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the br0w of Mount Ida (a small monticule fo nomed) we met with and engaged a yourig Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Sclo with an Engli\u017fh lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" faid the Greek, \"and would hove taken me witb hirn; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likoly to get married. He was an odd, bul a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left ari old man in oharge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines f0r it, (aboul L250 English cvrrency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the differerit islands.\"\nThis account excited our cvriosity vory mucb, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our couritryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old mari, who conducted us over lhe mansion. It consisted 0f four apartments on the ground-f1aor\u2014an entrance hal1, a drawing-r0om, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stoiried walls, marble tables on either side, a large rnyrtle iri the cenlre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning po\u017fture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozenEnglish cane chairs, arid an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, witb two sluffed cotton quilt\u017f and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large scaman's chest in the closel: it was open, bvt we did not think ovrselves justified in examinirig the contenls. On the tablct of the recess loy Vollairc's, Sbakspeare's,B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German 1anguclgc; Klopst0ck's Messiah; Kotzehue's noveIs; Schiller's play af the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editlon, printed at Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Conslantinople, much torn, but no English book of any de\u017fcription. Most of these books were filled with marginol notes, written witha pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scrib6led all ouer, and marked withslips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man sald: \"The lord had been reading tbese books the evening before he scliled, and forgol to placc thom with the others; hut,\" said he, \"there they must lle vntil bis return; for he is so particvlar, that were I to move one thing without 0rders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I 0ncc did him a service; ond I have the produee of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twerity zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides ina small oottage ln the woad, and whom tho lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't kn0w for whatreasori.\"\nTbe oppearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen braad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Greoian architecturc,) were considerably higher than the roof. The ro of, surrounded by a light stono balustrade, was covered by a finc Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong ooarse linen. Most of the hou\u017fe-tops are thus furnished, os upon them the Greeks pafs their evenirigs in smoking, drinking Iight wines, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating frujl, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes wcre clustering together on its borders, ond under the shade of two largc myrtle bvshes, a marble seat with anornamcntal wooden back waf placed, on whjch we were lold, lhe lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I fuppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attcnded our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye v iew.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla,covered wlth olive and rnyrtle trees in bloom, and on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek tempIe appeared in majestic decay. A small streclm issuingfrom the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near tbe mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, through a vista of lofly chesn ut and palm-trees, several smaIl islands wero distinetly observed, studding the Iight blue wavo with \u017fpots of emerald green. I seldom enioyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who hcld resided in this romantic so1itude: none knew his name but Domiriick, hjs banker, who had gone to Candia. \"Thc Armeriian,\" said our conductor, \"cou1d tell, but I am suro hc will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you telI, old frierid?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars af the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when hewas last upon the is1and, and even danced with them at the nuplial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses to othors, and cotton and sllk to the girls who live by weavlng those articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he oflen gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we callected, t0 have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. 0ne circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thougbt proper not t0 disclosc. He had a most beavtiful daughter, with whom the lord was aften seen wal king ori the sea-shore, and he had bought her apiano-farte, and taught her himfols lhe usc of il.\nSuch was the information with whioh we departed from the peacefu1 isIe of Mitylenc; our imaginatjons all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanlhropy of disposition, and all those ecce-\nntricities which mark peculiar genius. A rrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling iri company with Mr. FOSTER, lhe architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Gree-\nce, \"The indivldual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so arixious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trovels on the islarid of Tenedo\u017f, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we bad been some years from hoine; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recIuse of Ccllcla in every page. Deeply did we r egrct not having been more curious in our researchesat the cottage, but we conso1ed ourselves with the ideo of retuming to Mitylene ori some fulure day; but to mc that day will nevcr retvrn. I mako thi\u017f statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, arid in jvstjce to his lordship's gaod name, whieh has bceri grossly slandered. He haf been described as of an unf-\neeling dispositi0n, averse lo asfociating with human nalure, or contrlbuting jn any way to soolh its sarrows, or add to its plea\u017fures. The foct js directly the reverse, as moy be plainly gathered from these liltle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted ln his lordship's poems, seem t0 have their seat inhis 6osoin. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear lo guide all hif actions: and his caurting the repose ofsolitude is an additional reasori for marking him as a being on who\u017fe heart Religion halh set her seal, ond ouer whose head Benevolence bath thrown ber mantle. No man can read the preeeding pleasing \"traits\" without fecling proud of him as a countrymcln. With respect to his loves or ploasures, I do not assume a right to gjve an opini0n. Reports are ever to be roceived with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and bo who dares justify bimsels before that awful tribunal whero all must appear, alone may censure the errors of o fell0w-morta1. Lord Byron's eharacter is worthy of bis gcnius. To da good in secret, and shvn the world's applause, is the \u017furest testiinony os a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","26":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE suporstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in tho Easl. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself lo the Greekf untll after the estoblishment of Christianity;and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timc, the idea becaming prevalent, that a Laljn body could not corrupt jf bvried in their territory, il gradually inerea\u017fed,and formed the su6ject of many woriderfvl stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graues, and feoding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. In the West it spread, with sorne sljght variation, oll over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existcd, that vampyres nightIy imbjbed a certain portion of lhe blood of lheir vjctims, who becclme emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily diedof consumpti0ns; whilsl those human bl0od-sucker\u017f fclttcned\u2014and their vcins became distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow sr0in all the passages 0f their bodies, and even from tbc very pores of their \u017fkins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accounl of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreygo, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examinotion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, abo ut fivo years before, a cortain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a uampyre, buthad found a way to rid himfelf of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of tbe vompyre's grave, ond rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did n0t prevent hiin srom becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days aftcr his death arid burial, many persons complained of baving been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had 6een deprived of life by his atlacks. T0 prevent further mischief, the inhabitants havjng consulted thelr Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is suppofed to ho usual in cclses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting al lhe moulh,no\u017fc, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof havlng been thus obtained, they res0rtcd to the accustomed remedy. A stake was drivon entirely througb the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reporled to have crledout as dreadfully as if he had beeri alive. This done, they cvt osf his bead, bvrned his body, and tbrew the asbes into his grave. The same measures wereadopted with the c0rses of those persons who had previ0vsly died from vampyrism, lest they should, intheir turn, become agents up0n others who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by a uampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, becavse it seems better adapted to iIlustrate lhe subject of tho presenl observations than any other lnftance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it js considered a\u017f a sort of punishmerit after death, for some heinous crime cominitted whilst in existence, that the deceased js not only do0med to vampyrise, but compelled to confine hls infernal visitati0ns solely to thoso beings he loved most whlle upori earth\u2014thosc ta whom he was bound by ties of kjndred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall frorn its tombbe rerit; Then ghaftly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sisler, wife, At mldnight drain the stream of life; Yel loalhe the banquet which perforce Mu\u017ft feed thy livid 1iving corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon sor tbeir sire; As cursing thee, thou cvrsing them, Thy flowers are withered 0n the stom. But orie that for thy orime mvst fall, The youngest,best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy tclsk and mark Her cbeek's last linge\u2014her eye's Iast spark,And lhe la\u017fl glassy glance rnust view Which freezes o'er lts lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow bair, Os wbich, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But riow is 6orne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Tben stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014clnd with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these iri borror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has a1so introduced in his wild but 6eautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned fram the gravo for lhe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whllst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resv1led from the sinfuIness of her life, she being pourtrayed thraughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenco. Tho veracious Tournefort gives cl long account in his travels of sevoral astonishjng cases of vampyrisrn, t0 which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmel, in bis great work upon thjs fubject, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditionary narratives ilIustralive ofils effects, has put farth some learned dissortotions, tending to provc il to be a classical, as well a\u017f barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singular1y horrible superslitiori mjght be addcd; though the present may suffice for the limit\u017f of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, clrid which inay now be concIuded by merely romarklng, that thougb the term Vampyre is the one in most gencral acoeptation, there are seueral others synonymous with it, made usc of in variou\u017f parts of the world: as Vravcol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attondant upon a London winter, tbore appeared at the vclrious parties of the leaders of the tori a nobleman, moro remarkable for his \u017fingularities, than hjs rank. He gazed upon themirth around him, as if he covld not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of thc fair only altracted his attention, that he might by a look quell lt, and throw sear into th0se breasts where thoughtlessnes\u017f rcigned. Those wh0 felt this senfation os awe, could not explain whence lt arose: some attributed it to the dead groy eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, djd not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce tbrough to lho inward workings of the hearl; but fell uponthe cheek wilh a leaden ray that weighedupon lhe skin it c0uld nol pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited lo every bouse; oll wished to \u017fee him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weigbt os ennui, were pleased at having somethjng in their presence capable of engaging their attonliori. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warrner tlnt, elther from lhe blusb of rnodesty, 0r from the strong emotion of passion, though its forrn and outlinewere beautiful, many of the femole hunters aftcr notoriety attempted to wjn his attenti0ns, and gain, at leclst, \u017fome marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockeryof every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, clnd did all but put 0n the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when fhe stood beforc him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it soemed as if they were unperccived;\u2014even her unappa1led impudenee was baffled, and she left the field. But though tho common advltreff could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent ta him: yet such was the apparent caution witb whicb he spoke to the virtuous wife ond innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Hc had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was tbclt it even overcclme the dread of his singvlar character, or lhat they were moved by hi\u017f apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form tho boast of their sex from their domestic virtuef, as among those who svlly it 6y thoir vjces.\nAbout the same time, there carne to London a young genlleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of greal wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alfa to himsolf by guardians, who thought it their duty merely totake care of his fortune, while they relinqvished the more importarit charge of his mlrid lo the care of mcrceriary subalterns, he cultivated more his imaginotion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honovr arid cand0ur, which daily ruins so mony inilliners' appreriticc\u017f. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and lhought that vjcc was thrawn in by Providence merely sor the plcturesque offect of the scene, as we see in romarices: be thought that the misery of a cottage merely corisisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were bctter adaptcd to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colourcd patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded him, striving whioh should deseribo with least lruth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by thelr brightenirig countenances wben he approachod, ond by tbeir sparkling eyes, when be ope ried his lips, foon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitaryhaurs, he waf startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot fr0m the presenoo of a ghost, but from want of snvffing, thcre was no foundalion in real life for any of thal congeries of pleasing pictures and dcscriptio ns contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinary being we havo above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of sorming an idea of the cbaracter of a man enlirely absorbed in himself, wbogave few other \u017figns of his observation of external objects, tban the tacil asserit to their exiftence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowjng his imagination to piclure euery thing that flattered its propensity to extravagarit ideas, he soon formed this object into the horo os a romance, and determined to ob\u017ferve the offspring of his fancy, rather than tbe person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far aduanced upon his riotice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually Ieclrnt that Lord Ruthven's offairs were ombarrassed, and so0n found, from tbe notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, tbat he was about to travol. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted lo his guardians, that it waf time for him to perforrn the tour, which for mariy generalionf has been thought necessary to enable the young to lake some rapid steps in the career of vico towards putling themselves vpon an equalily with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallenfrom the fkies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subiects ofpleasantry or as praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn in carrying thein on. They consented: and Aubrey immediatoly mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive fram him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from hlm, who, appclrent ly, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, arid in a few days they had passed tbe circling waters.\nHjtherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's characler, and now be found, that, though mony more os his actions were expofed to his view, the resulls offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle,the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enovgb to relieve their immediate wanls. But Aubrey eould n0t avoid remarking, that it was riat upon the vlrtuous, reduced to lndigenceby the misfortunes attendont even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer\u017f; but when the profligate came to a\u017fk fomething, not to relieve hls wants, but to all0w him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was \u017fent away with rich charlty. This was, bowever, altributed by him to tbe greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vjrtuaus indigent. Tbere was one circumstance ahout the charity of his Lordsbip, which was stjll more impressed upon his mind: all those vpon whom it was bestowed, inev jtably found that there was a curse upon il, for they were all either led lo tho scafsold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns lhrough wbich tbey passed, Avbrey wcls surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cenlres of all fashjonable uice; there he entered into all the spirit os the faro table: hc betted, and always gambled with fuccess, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and lhen he lost even more than he gained;but it wos always with the same unchanging sace, with which hc gerierally watched the saciety around: it was not, however, so when be encouritered the rash youthfuI novice, or lhc luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wisb seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mirid was laid aside, andhif eyes sporkled with more fire than lhat of the cat whilst dallying with the ha1f-dead mouse. In every lown, he loft the formerly affluenl youth, torn from thecircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within lhe reach of this fiend; wbil\u017ft many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wecllth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to solisfy their present craving. Yot he look no money from the gambling table; but immediately last, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: thi\u017fmight bul be the result of a certclin degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable os combating the cvnning os lhe more expericnced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to bif friend, and beg hlm to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend lo hi\u017f own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for cacb day he hoped hi\u017ffriend would givc bim some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this neuer occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, arid amidst the various wild and ricb scenes of nature, was always lhe same: his eye spoke le\u017fs than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from jt than the conftant oxeitement of vajnly wisbing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began lo assumetbe appearance of something supernatural.\nTbey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a timo losl sight of his companion; he left him in daily ottendance upon the morning circle of an Itolian countess, whiIst he went jn searoh of the memorlals of another almost deserted cily. Whilst he wos thus engaged, letters clrriued from England, whicb he opened with eager impatlence; the first was fr0m his sister, breathing nothing but afsection; the others were from his guordiclns, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagiriatjon that there was an evil power residcnt in his companion, these seemed to glve him sufsicjent reason sar the belief. His guardians insisted up0n hls immediately leaving his friend, and urgcd, that his character was dreadfully uicjous, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduclion, renderod his licentious habits more dangerous to \u017foeiety. It had boen discovered, thclt hif contempt for lhe adultress had not originated in halred ofhcr character; but that bo had required, to enharice his gratiflcation, that his victim, the pa rtner of his guilt, should be hvr1ed from the pinnacle af unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abysf os infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he hcld sought, apparent1y on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, lhrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled t0 expose the wh0le defor mity of thcir uices to the pvblic goze.\nAubrey detormined vpon leaving one, whose character had not yet showri a single bright point on which lo rost the eye. He resoIved to invent f0me plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, and saon perceived, that his Lardship was endeavouring to workupan the inexperience of the daughtor of lhe lady whose house he chiefly frcquented. In Italy, it is seldom that cln unmarried fema1e is met with ln society; he wa\u017f tberefore obliged ta carry on his plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye followed hirn in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appainted,which would most likely end inthe ruin of an innoeent, though thoughtless girl. Lo\u017fing no time, be enlered tho apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abrupt1y asked him his intentions with respect to lhe lcldy, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very nlght. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were fucb as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey relired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship iri the remainder of their propofed tour, be ordorod his servant to seek other opartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of aIl he knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the charactor of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rvthven next day merely sont his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion af hi\u017f plans baving becn foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stops lowards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upan monuments that apparently, asbamed of cbronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering sail or many coloured lichen. Urider tbe same roof as himfelf, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might haue for ined the m0del for a pajnler wisbing to povrtray on canvass the promised hope of lbc faithful in Mah0met's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much rnind for any orie to thlnk she could belong to those wbo had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's \u017fide, one would have thought the gazelle cl poor type of her beclu-\nties; for who would haveexchanged her eye, apparently lhe eye of anjmated nature, for that sleepy lvxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an eplcuro. The light step of Ianthe often accompaniedAubrey in his search after antiquities, clnd often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her farm, floating as jt were upon the wind, to tbe eager gaze af him, who forgot thc lelters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced lahlet, in the contemplotion of her sylph-like figvrc. Often would her tresses falling, as \u017fhe flitted around, exhibjt in the sun's ray such dellcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgctfulness of the antiquary, who let escape fram his mirid the veryobjoct he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attcmpt lo describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youlb, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling ballf. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wjshed to proserve a memorial for his suture hours, she would stand by, ond wcltchthe magic effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe soen es of her native place; she wau1d then describe to him the circling dance upon the open pIain, would pclint, to him in clIl the glowing colo urs of youthful memory, thc marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, turning to subjects that had evident1y made a greator impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural taIes of her nurse. Her earnestness clnd apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him lhe tale of the living vompyre, wbo had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the en\u017fving moriths, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out os sucb idle and harrlble fclritasies; but Ianthe cited to him the nclmesof old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after seueral of their near relatjves and childreri had been found marked with the \u017ftamp of the fiend'f appctite; and when she found bim so incredulou\u017f, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those wha had dored to question their existenoe, always had some pro0f given, wbich obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confeff it was true. She detailed to him the troditional oppearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretly accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, stlll persisted in persuading her, that there could he no truth in her fears, lhough at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences whichhad all tended lo excite a belief in the supernatural power 0f Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began t0 attach himself more and more to Iarithe; her innocence, so controsted with all the affected virtues ofthe women among whoin he had sought for hif visi0n of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young mcln of Eng1ish habits, marryirig an urieducatedGreek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form hefore him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for same antiquarion research, he would doparl, delermined not to return uritll his object wo\u017f attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attcntion up0n the ruins around him, whilst inhis mind he retained an image thatsoemod alone the rlghtful pos\u017fefsor of hls thoughts. Ionthc was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always scemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was bcccluse sbe had no longer any one with whomsbe could visjt hor fav0urite haunts, whilst her gvardian was occupied in sketohing or vncoveringsome fragment which had yet escaped tbe destructivc hand of time. She bad appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and lhey both, with severcll prosent, affirmedtheir exlstence, pale with horror at the very riame. Soon after, Aubrey doterrnined to pr0ceed upon one of hls exoursions, which was to detain himfor a few hours; when theyheard the name of the place, they alI at once begged of him not to roturn at night, as he must necessari1y pass throvgh a wood, whcre no Grcek would ever rcmain, after the day had closed, upon any considerati0n. They descrlbed il as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who daredta cross their path. Aubrey made light of lheir representations, and trjed to laugh them out 0f the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring lhus to mock a fuperior, infernaI pawer, lhe very narne of whichapparently made their hl0od freeze, he was siIent.\nNcxt morning Aubrey set osf upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to obferve the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned lofind lhclt his words, mocking the bolief of those horrible siends, had inspired tbem with such terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and eorneslly begged of hiin to return, ere night aIlowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his reseorch, that ho did not perceive that day-light would soori end, and that in the horizon there wof one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather irito a tremendous mass, and pour all thelr rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He al last, bowevcr, mounted hi\u017f horse, detormined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twllight, in theso southern climates, js almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, njgbt begins: and erehe had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its ecbolrig thunders had scarceIy an lnterval of resl\u2014jts tbick heavy roin forced ils way throvgh the canopying faliage, whilst the blue forked Iightriing seemed to fall and radiate at his very fect. Suddenly his horse look fright, and be was carried with dreadful rapidity lhrough the entangled forest. The anima1 atlast, through fatjgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, tbat he was in the rieighbourhood of a hovel that hard1y lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood whlch \u017furrounded it. Dismouriting, he approclched, h0ping to sind some orieto guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain sheltcr from the pelting of the storm. As be approached, the thundcrs, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a waman mingling with the \u017ftifled, exultant moekery os a laugh, continued in one almost unbr0ken sound;\u2014he was startled: hut, roused by tbe thunder which clgain rolled over his heod, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He f0und himseIf in utter darkness: the sourid, however, guidcd hirn. He was apparently unporceived; for, though he called, still the \u017founds eontinued, and no notice was taken of him. Ho found himself ln c0ntact with some one, whom he immediately sei2ed; when a voice cried, \"Agairi basfled!\" lo which a loud lough succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by ane whose strength seemed superhuman: determincd to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; bul it wasin vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled wjth eriorm0us force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himse1f upon him, and knoeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his thraat\u2014when lhe glare 0f many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed bjm;\u2014he instanlly rose, and, leaving bis prey, rushed through the door, arid in a momcnt the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, wa\u017f no longer heard. The storm was now \u017ftjll; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those wjthout. They entered; the light os their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch l0aded on every individual straw with heavy flakef of soot. At thc desire of Aubrey they searched for her who hcld attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horrar, when the light os the torohes once m0ro burst up0n him, t0 perceive the airy form of his falr condvctress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut hif eyes, h0ping thclt it wos but a vision arisirig from his disturbed imagination; bvt he a gain saw the sclme form, wheri he unclosed them, stretched by his \u017fide. There was no colaur upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness clbout her face that seemed a1mosl as attaching as the ljfe that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast wos blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having apened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultarieously struck wilh h0rror, \"A Vampyre! a Vompyre!\" A littor was quickly formed, clnd Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lcltely been to him the o bject of so many brigbt and fairy vjsions, now fallen with the flower os lise that bad died within her. He knew not what his tboughts were\u2014his mind was henumbed and seemed to sbun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in hjs hand a naked dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the hut. Tbey were soon met by difforent parties wbo had been engaged in the soarch 0f her wbom a malhcr had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parerits of same dreadful catastropho. \u2014To descri6e tboir grief would be impossihle; but when they ascertained the cause os their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. Thcy were inconsalable; both died br0ken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a m0st violentscver, and was often delirlous; in thcse intervals he wovld call upon Lord Ruthven arid upon Iantho\u2014by some unaccountable combiriation he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he l0ved. At othertjmes he wauld imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse hjm as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever m0tive, upon hearing 0f the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the some house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified clndstartled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, byhis kind words, imp1ying almostrepentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. Hls lordship seeined quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who bad so astonished Aubrey; but as s0on as his convalescence began to be rapid, he ogain gradually retired irito the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived rio difference from the former man, except that ot times he was svrprised to meet his gaze fixed jntently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hjrn. During lhe last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apporently engaged in watching the tideless wavcs raiscd 6y the coolirig breeze, or in marking lhe progress of those orbs, circllng, llke our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wjsh to avoid the eyos of all.\nAubrcy's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and thal elasticjty of spirit which had once s0 distinguished him riow seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silerice as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wishod for solitude, his mind could not flnd it in the neighbourhood of Athens; lf he sought it clmldst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iantbe's form stood by his side\u2014if he fought it in the woods, her light step wouldclppear wandering amidst tbe vnderwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, wovld show, tohis wlld imagination, her palo faoe and wounded throat, with o meek smiIe upan her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every seature of whicb created such bitter ass0ciations in his mind. He propased to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by tbe tender care he had takon of him during his lllness, that they shovld vifit those parts of Greece neither had yct seen. They travelled in every directiori, and sought every spot to which a recolleotiori could be ottachcd: but though they thus hastened fr0m place to pla ce, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mvch of robbers, but lhey gradually began to slight these reports, which theylmagined were only the invention of individuals, whofe interest it was to excito lhe generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In eonsequence of tbu\u017f neglectlng the advjce of the inhabilants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a deferice. Upon entering, bowever, a narrow defile, clt the battom of whicb was the bcd of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down fram the neighbouring precipices,they bad rcason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of lhe party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistlirig of bullets closc to their heads, and bythe echoed report of severaI guns. In an instant their guard\u017f had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, hcld begun to fire in the djrection wbcnce the repart came. Lard Ruthven and Au6rey, imitaling their oxample, retired sor a moment 6ehind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being lbus delained by a fae, who with insulting shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, jf any of the robbers should climb obove and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shclter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received cl shot inthe shovlder, which braught hjm lo tbe gr0und. Aubrey haslened to his asslstance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by \u017feeing thc robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown vp their arms and surrendered.\nBy promise\u017f of great reward, Aubroy soon jnduced them to oonvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was n0 more disturbed by theirpresence\u2014tbey being conterit merely to guard theentrance till their eoinrade should return with the promlsed sum, for which he had cln order. Lord Ruthven's slrength rapidly decreafed; in two dayf mortlsication enfued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct clnd appearance had not changed; he seemed as uneonsciovs 0f pain as he had been of tho obiects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent1y uneasy, and his eye aflen fixed upori Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with moro thari usual earnestness\u2014\"Assisl me! yov inay save mo\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean nol my life, I heed the death of iny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, yavr fr iend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but liltle\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if y0u would conceal all you kriow ofme, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014andif my death were vnknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violerice, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by al1 your nature fears, swear that, for a year ond a doy you will not impart your knowledgo of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whcltever may happen, or whatev er you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breclthed no more.\nAubrey relired to rest, but did riot sleep; the many circumstances atteriding his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mjnd, and he knew not why; when he remembcred his oalh a coId shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment af something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about lo eriter the hovel in which he had left the corpso, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and eomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnclcle of a neighbouringmount, according lo a promise thoy had given his lordship, that it should be exposed tothe fjrst cold ray of the moori that rose af ter his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to g0and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he hcld mounled to lhe sumrnit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbcrs swore lhey pointed out thc identica1 rock on which they had laid thc body. Far a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lastreturned, eonv inced that they had buried the corp\u017fe for lhe sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a oountry iri which he had met witb such terrlble misfortunes, ond in which all apparently conspired to heighten tbat superftilious molancholy that had selzed upon his mind, he resolved ta leave it, and soon arrivcd at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naplcs, he occupied himse1f in arranging those esfects he hcld with him bolonging to Lord Rutbven. Amongsl other tbings there was a ease containlng severol woapons of offence, more or less adapted to en\u017fure lhe death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Wbilft turning them over, and examinirig their curious f0rms, what was his surprise al finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style os the dagger discovered in the fata1 hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hasteriing to gajn further proof, be found the weapon, and his borror may he imagined when he discovered that it fittcd, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held ln bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seomed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the parlicular form, the same varying tinls upon the haft and fheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; lhere were alfo drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, hi\u017f first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted lo sriatch froin Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortuno ruined, and she hcld not been heard of since the dcparture of bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost brokeri vnder so many repeated horrors; he was asraid that tbis lady had fallen a victim to the dest royer af Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupatiori consisted in urging the speed of the postili0ns, as if he were going to save the life of fome one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; o breeze, which soemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Eng1ish shores; and he hastened to tho mansion of his fatherf, and there, for a moment, clppeored to lose, in the emhraccs and caresses of his sister, oll memory of thc past. If she befare, by her infantine caresses, had gairied his affection, now that the womcln bogan to appear, she was still rnore attachlng as a c0mpanion.\nMiss Avbrey had not that wirining grace which gains thegaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that lighl brilliancy which only exist\u017f iri the heated atmosphere of a crowded aparlment. Her blue eye was never lit up by thc lovity of the mind beneath. Therc was a melancholy charin about it which did n0t seem to arise from misfortune, bvt from some foeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul canscious of a brighter reolm. Her step was natthat light footing, wbich strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate ond pen\u017fivo. When alono, her face was nevor brightened by the smile of joy; but when berbrother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence sorget those griefs she knew destroyed hls rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of tho voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then p1aying in the ljght of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presenled to the world, it having been thou ght by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deIayed until her brother's return from the contjnent, whcn he might be her protector. It wos now, thercfore, rosolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approclching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of hif fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest ob0ut the frivolities of fashionabIe strangers, when his mind had been so lorn by the events he hadwitnessed; bul he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to thc protcction of bis sister. They soon arrivedin town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe orowd was excessive\u2014a drawirig-room had not becn held sor a long time, and all who were anxious lo bosk iri the smile of royalty, hastened thithor. Aubrey was there with his sister. Wbile he wcls standing in a corner 6y himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance thclt the first lime he had seen Lord Ruthven was in thot very place\u2014he felthimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice herccognized too well, soundod in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, feclrful of seeing cl spectre that would blast bim, when he perceived, ot a little distance, the same sigvre whichbad attracted his notice on this spot upon his sirft entry into soeiety. He gazed tlll his limbs almost refusirig to bear their weighl, he was obliged to take the arm of afriend, and sorcing a passage through lhe crowd, he threw himsolf into his carriage, clnd was driven home. He paced the room witb hurried sleps, and fixed his hands upon his hecld, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him\u2014oircumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He rousedhimself, he could not belieue it possible\u2014the dead rise agaln!\u2014He thought his imagination had corijured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determined, theref-\nore, to go again into saciety; for thougb he atlempted to afk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig upon his lip\u017f, and he covld not suoeeed in gaining informcltian. He werit a fewnights after with his si\u017fter to the assembly of a noar relation. Leavirig her under the protection of a matron, he rotired into a recess, and there gave himself up ta his own devouring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, lhat many were Ieavlng, he roused himself, and entering another room, found bis sister surrounded by severa1, apparently in earncst conversation; he attempted to pass and get neclr her, when one, wbom he requested to move, tvrned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprarig forward, seizod his sister's arm, and, with bvrricd step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himfelf lmpeded by the crowd of scrvants who were waiting for their lords; and wbile he was engaged in pclssing them, be again beard lhat voice whisper close t0 him\u2014\"Remernber your oath!\"\u2014He dld not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sisler, soon reached hame.\nAubrey became alinost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engr0ssed, now that the certainty os the monster's ljving againpressed upon hif thoughts. His slster's attentions were now unheeded, and it wasin vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had eaused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he tbought, the mare he was bewildered. His oclth startled him;\u2014was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and n0t avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But euen if he were ta breclk his oath, and dlsclose his svspici0ns, wha would belieue him? He thought of empIoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his \u017fister oame, who, with eyes streamlng with tears, besought him, for ber sakc, to support nature. At last, no longer capable os bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his bouse, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that irnage which haunled him. His dress becclme neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; at fjrst he returned witb tbe evenlng to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiaus for his safety, employed people ta follow him; but they were \u017foon distanced by him who fled fram a pursuer swiftcr than any\u2014froin thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by bis absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend omon gst them, of whose prefence they were unconsci0us, he determined to enter again into society, and wotch him closely, anxious toforewarn, jn spite of bis oath, allwhom Lord Ruthven appraached with intimacy. But when he enlered lnto aroom, his baggard clrid \u017fuspicious looks were so striking, his inward fhudderings so visible, that his sister wcls al lost abliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake,a sociely which clffocted him s0 strongly. When, however, remonstrarice proved unavailing, the guardiansthought proper to interpose,and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, tbey thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been beforo imposcd upon them by Aubrey's porents.\nDesirous of faving hlm from the injuries and suffering\u017f be had daily encounterod iri his wanderings, and of preventirig him fr0m exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, lhey engaged a physician lo reside in the hovse, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeored to notice it, sa completeIy was his mind absorbed by ono terrible subjoct. His incaherence becamcat last so great, that he was confined to his cbamber. There he would often lie for dayf, incapable of being roused. He had hecome emaeiated, his eyes hcld attained a glasfy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affecti0n and recollcction remainingdisplayed itself upori the enlry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that seuerely afflicted her, he would dcsire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not toucb him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not ga near him!\" Wheri, however, she inquired lo whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lclsted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pas\u017fing, his incohcrences became 1ess frequent, and bis rnind thrcw off a portion of its gl0om, whilst his guardiaris observed, that several times inthe day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, ane of his guardians entering hls room, began lo conuerse with bis physiclan upon tbc melancboly eircumstance os Aubrey's beirig in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelIeot, af which they feared he hod heen dcprived, they inentioned the namo of lhe Earl of Marsderi. Thiriking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in soclely, Avhrey seemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by his expressirig his lntention la be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes hjs sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of belng affected by the influence of her lovely smilo; for he presscd ber to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brather's being once rnore aliue to lhe feelings of affectjon. He began lo speak with all his wonted warmth, and to corigratulate her upon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evcry accompllsbmenl; when be suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; open ing it, what was his surprise at 6choldirig the features of the monster who had so long influenced his ljse. He seized the p0rtrait in a paroxysrn of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her osking hiin why he thus destroyed lhe resemblarice of her future husbclnd, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her bands, and gazing ori her with a frantic exprossion 0f countcnance, he badc ber swear that she would never wed this rnonster, for he\u2014 But he could not cldvance\u2014it seemed as if that uojce again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought thls was but areturn of his disorder, enter-\ned, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leavo him. Hc sell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged af them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, cndeav0ured to pocify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthveri had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Wherihe heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily vnderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he leamed that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be conccaled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the hovse of hi\u017f former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affeclion for the brother and inter est in bis fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his powor? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual bauing no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save witb her to whom he addressed himseIf;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thal he migbt listen lo ber soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he kncw so wcll how lo vse the serpent's art, or sucb was the will of fate, that he gained her affeclions. Tbc title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtaincd an important embassy, which served as an excufe for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which wa\u017f to take place the very day before his departure for the eontinent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardianf, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in voin. He asked for pen and paper; it was givcn him; he wrote a letter to his \u017fister, conjuring her, as she valued hor 0wn happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who onoe beld hor jn their arms as their hope and the hope of thcir house, to dolay but for a sew hours that marriage, on whieh he denounced tbe most heavy curses. The servants promised they would dellver it; but giving it to the physician, he lhought it bettor not ta harass any more the mirid of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest lo the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that mcly inore easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of cclrriages broke upan bis eor. Aubroy grew almast frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame lheir vigilancc, tbey gradually sto1e away, leaving hjm in the custody of on helpless old woman. He sei2ed the opporlunity, with one bound was out of the room, arid in a m0ment found himself in tbe apartinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri wcls the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takjng his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless withrage. Wben on the staircase, Lord Ruthven wbispered iri his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sist er is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushcd him towards his clttendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in seclr ch of him. Aubrey covld rio longer support himseIf; his rage not slndjng vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. Thiswas nol mentioned lo his sister, who was not present when he enterod, as the pbyslcian was afrclid of agitating her. The marriage wos soleinnized, and tho bride and bridegroomleft Lond0n.\nAuhrey's weakness increased; the effvsion os blood produced symploms of thc near approach of deoth.

Lord Rulhven had disappeored, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose hif place 0f rest, and Providence hisguide.\"\nIN Sailing tbrough the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into tbe harbour of Mitylenc, in the island os that name. The beau ty of lhis place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, iriduce many Brilish vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmon; and tbough it ljes rather out of the track for sbips bound to Smyma, its hountiesamply repay for the deviation of a vayago. We landed; as vsual, al the bottom of the bay, arid whilst the men wereemployed in watering, and the purser bargainlng for cattle with the nalives, lho clorgyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule sonamed) we met with and cngaged a young Greek as our guidc, who told us he had come from Scio wilh an English lord, who left the jsland fovr days previous to ovrarrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pllol,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not chooso to quit Mitylene, where I am like1y to get married. He was ori odd, but a very good man. The cottage over tbe hill, facing lhe river, belongs to him, and he bas left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English eurrcncy,) and bas resided there about fourtecn months, tbough not constantly; for he sclils ln his felucca very osten to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening t0 thehouse where our countryman had resided. We were kindly recejved by anold man, who conducted uf over tho mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-slaor\u2014ari ontrclnce hall, a drclwing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, wlth a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorclted: plain green-stained wolls, marble tablcs on either side, a largo myrtle in lhe centre, and a small fountain beneath,which could be made to play through the branohes by mouirig a spring fjxed in the side of a small br0nze Venus in a learilng posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnjture. In the hall slood half a dozen Eng-\nljsb cane chairs, and an empty book-ca\u017fe: there were no mjrrors, nor a sirigle painting. The bedchamher had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottori quilts arid a plllow\u2014the c0mmon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we obferved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large searnan's chest in the closot: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining lhc contents. On the tablet 0fthe recess lay Voltaire's, Shclk speare's, Boileclu's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Rvins of Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; KIopftoek's Messjah; Kotzebue's riovel\u017f; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradjse Lost, an Italian edition, prjnted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constanlinople, much torri, but no English book ofany descriplion. Most of these book\u017f were filled with marginal notes, writlen with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiclh wasliterally scribbIed all over, and marked wjth slip\u017f of paper, on which olso were remarks.\nThe old man said:\"The lord had been readirigthese books lhc euening before he sailcd, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there tbey must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing wltbout orders, he wou ld frown upon me for a weck together; he is otherwayf very good. I once did him a service; and I have tbe produoe of this farm far the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines whieh I pay to an aged Armenian who refides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom tho lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black p1inths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher lhari thc roof. The roof, surrourided by a light slone balustrclde, was couerod by a fine Turkey carpet, bonealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnifhed, cls vpon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, svch as \"lachryma chrjsli,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet glided away, grape\u017f, orangef and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the fhode of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his eveningf and nlghts ljll twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prayjng\" for he was very devout, \"andalways attended ovr church twicc a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line 0f rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, couered with olive and myrtIe trees in 6loom,and ori the suinmjl of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smootb as glass, and on horiz0n unshadowed by a single cloud, terminales the view in front; and a little on lhe left, through a vista of lofty che\u017fnut and palm-lrees, severaI small islands were distinctly observcd, studding theIight blue wave with fpots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirics were fruitles\u017f as ta the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew hi\u017f name but Dominick, his bonker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cauld te1l, but I ain sure ho will riot,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, oId friend?\" \u017faid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to uisit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt severa1 particularf 0f the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upori the island, and even danced with them at the rivptial feast. He gave a cow lo one mon, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who liveby weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, arid he ofteri gave Groek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collecled, lo have been a very occentric orid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought praper not to disclose. Hc had o most beautiful doughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking 0n thc sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her hjmsolf the use of it.\nSuch was the iriformation with wbich we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all ori the rack, gue\u017fsing wbo this ram6ler in Grcece could he. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all tho\u017fe eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Follirig in company with Mr. FOSTER, the clrchitecl,a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been trclvelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The lndividual,\" sajd he, \"about whom you are so anxiou\u017f, is Lord Byron; I mct him in my travels ori the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard as his l0rdship's same, as we had been some yoars from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into ovr hands we rec0griized thc recluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cattage, but we consoIed ourfeIves with tbe idea of returnirig to Mitylene on some futuro day; bvt to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quiteuninteresting, and in justice to hif lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been descrlbed as of an unseeling difposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in ariy way to soolh its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly tbe reverse, as may beplainly gathered from theso little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so clegantly depioted in his lordship'\u017f poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderriess, sympath y, and charity oppear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitudeis clri additional reason for markinghim as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal,and over whose head Benevolenco halh thrown her mantle. Noman cari read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not clssumc a right to give an opinion. Report\u017f are ever to be receivod with cclution, particularly when directed against man's moralintegrity; and he who dares justify himsels befare lhat awfu1 tribunal where all must appear, olone mcly censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's characteris worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the wor1d's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous beart and self-approvirig conscience.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown-courl, Fleet-street.","27":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy J0hn Wil1iam Polid0ri\nTHE superftition upon wh ich this tale isf0undcd is very general in the East. Amorig tbe Arabians it oppears to be comman: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establisbment of Christianity; and it has only assumed ils present form since the division of the Latin and Groek churches; at which limo, the idea becomirig prevalent, that a Latinbody could not oorrupt if buried in their territory, it gradvally increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfvl stories, stlll extant, of the dead rising from thcir graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West lt spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austricl, and Lor rajno, where the belief exlsted, lhat vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion af the blood of their victims, who bocame emclciatod, losttbeir strenglh, and speedily dicd of consumptions; whilst these human bIood-suckers sattcned\u2014and their veins bocame distended to such a state of repletion, as lo cause the blood to flow from a1l the possages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn tho London Journal, 0f March, 1732, is a curiaus, and, of oourse, crcdibleaccount of a particular casc os vampyrism, which is stated tohave occurred at Madreyga, inHungary. Il appears, that upon cln examination of the commander -in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they p0sitively and unonimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontierf of the Tu rkish Servia, he had hecn tormented by a vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by ealing some of the earth out of the vampyrc's grave, and rubbirig himse1f with his blood. This preeoution, however, did not prevent him fram becoining a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and 6vrial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprlved of life by his attacks. To preuent further mischief,the inhabltantf having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrifm) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pvre and fIorid blood. Proof having beeri thus obtained, they resorted to the accvstomed remedy. A \u017ftclke was driven entirely thr0ugh the heart and body of A rnold Paul, at which he is reported to havo cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes inlo his grave. The sarne measures were adopted wlth the corses of those persans who had previously died from vclmpyrism, lest theyshould, in thcir tvrn, become agents upan others who sur-\nvived them.\nThe uriiversal belief is, that a person sueked by a vampyre becomes a uampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief 6ailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relaled, because il secms better adapted to jllustrate the subject of the present o6servcltions than any otber instance which couId be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is cansidered as a sort of purii\u017fhment after death, for some heinous crime eommitted whilst in existerice, thal the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrife, but compelled to consine his infernal vifitations solely to those beings ho loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was b ound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in thc \"Gi aour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy c0rse shall from its tomb be rent; Tben ghastly baunt tho nalive plac e, And suck the blood of all lhy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wlfe, At midnight drain thc stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy uictims, ero they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing theo, lhou cursing t hem, Thy flowcrs are withcred on the stem. But ono that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a fatber's name\u2014 Thclt word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's Iast tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance musl view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest plodge was worn\u2014 But n0w is borno away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own bestblood sball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard llp; Thcn \u017ftalking to thy sullen grove, Ga\u2014and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sbrink away From spectre more clccursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wl1d but beautiful poem of \"Thaloba,\" the vampyre corso of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the gravo for the purpose of tormentjng him she be\u017ft loved whilst in existerice. But this cannot be supposed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayod tbrougbout the wbole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tho veracious Tourriefort gives a long account in his travels of several asl0nishlng cases of vampyrism, to whlch he pretends to have heen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety 0f anecdotes, clnd traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertatians, tending to prove it to be a classical, as woll af bar6arian error.\nMany curious and interesling notices on this sirigularly horrible superstition mlght be added; though the present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely rcmclrking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most gerieral acceptation, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts af the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in tho midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared ot the vari0u\u017f parties of the leaders af the ton a noblernan, more remarkable for his singularities, thon his rank. Hc gazed upon the mirth around him, as if ho covld not participate therein. Apparently, the lighl laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that hc mighl by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensotion of awe, could not explain whence it aro\u017fe: some attributedit to the dead grey eye, which, fixing up0n lho object's face, did not seem to penotrale, and at one glance lo pierce through to the inward workings of tho heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skiri it cou1d not pass. His peculiarities caused him lo be invited to every hou\u017fo; all wjshed to see him, and those who had beeri accustomcd to vi0lent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleclsed at having \u017fomething in lheir presence capable of engaging their attcrition. In spite of tho deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strongemotion of passion, though its form and outline wero beautiful, many of the female bunters after notoricty atlempted to win his altentions, and gain, at least, some mclrks os what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and didall hut put on the dress 0f a mountebank, ta attract his notice:\u2014though in vairi:\u2014when she stood besore him, thovgh hi\u017f eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as jf tbey were vnperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But thougb the common adultres\u017f could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was n0t that the fcmale sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent eaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innoccnl daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to fomales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whother it was lhat il even overcame the droad of hls sirigular character, or thal tbey were moved by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form thc boast os their sex from their domcs tic virtues, as among those who sully il by their viccs.\nAbout the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an 0rphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in childhood. Lcft also to himsels by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they re1inquished the more lmportant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary fubalterns, he cultivated more his imagination tban his judgment. He had, hencc, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so inany milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that uice was tbrown iri by Providence merely for the picturesque esfect of thc scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of cl0thes, wbich were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various co1oured patches. He thought, in sine, that the dreams of poets were the realitjes of life. He was hands ome, frank, and rich: for these reas0n\u017f, upon his entering into the gay oircles, many m0thers surrounded him, striving whlch should describe with least lrvth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters al the same time, hy their brigbtenlng countenances when ho appr0ached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, \u017foon led him into false riotions of his laIents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance af his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, exeept in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from tbe presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for ariy of that congeries of pleasing pictures arid descriplions contained in thoso voluines, srom which he had formed his study. Findirig, however, some compensation in hjs gratified vonity, he was ab0ut to re1inquish his dreams,wheri the extraordinary belng we have obove described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched hirn; arid the very impossihility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few olher signs of hif ohfcrvation of external objects, than lbetacit asserit to tbeir existence, impIied by tbe av0idanoe of their eontact: allowing his imaginati0n to picture every thing that slattered its propensity t0 extrclvagant ideas, he soon formed this objectinto the hero of a r0mance, ond dctermined to observe the off\u017fpririg of his fancy, rather than the pcrson hesore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far cldvanced upon his notice, lhat bis presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt thclt LordRutbven's asfairs were embarrassed, and soan found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, thal he was about to travel. Desirous of gajning some insormation respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hjnted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, which for many generations has boeri thought necessary to enable the young to take \u017fome rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves vpon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallcn from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects 0f pleasantry or of praise, accordlng to the degree of skill sbewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to recelvo from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem fram hjm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly acceptod it, and in a few days they had passed the circling woters.\nHilhert0, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rvthven's charactor, and now he found, that, though many more of his actians were exposcd to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profvse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagobond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relievo their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to jndigence by lhe misfortunes altendanteven upon virtue, that he bcstowed hi\u017f alms;\u2014these were serit from the door wjth hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk s0mething, riot to relieve his wants, bul to allow hiin to wallow in his Iusl, or to sink hlm still docper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater impartunity of the vicious, which gerierally prevails over the retjrlrig bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There waf one circumstance ab0ut the charity af his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mlnd: all those upori whom it was bestowed, inevitclbly found that thore was a curse upon it, for tbey were al1 either lcd to the scaffold, 0r sunk to the lowest and lhe m0st abiect misery. At Brussels and other to wn\u017f through which they passed, Aubrey was svrprized at thc apparent eagerness with whiob his companion sought for the ceritres of alI fashionable vice; there he ontered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled wilh success, exoept where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then ho lofl even more than he gained; but il wa\u017f always with the same unchariging face, with which he generally watched tbe society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novlce, or tbe luckless father af a numerous family; then his vory wlsh seemed fortune's law\u2014lhis apparent abslractedness of inind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than thal of tbe cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he lefl the formcrly affluent youth, torn from tbe circle headorned, curslng, in the solitude ofa dvngeon, tbe fate that had drawnhim withiri the reach of this fiend; whilft many a father sat frantic, amidst thc speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhaut a slngle farthing of his late immerise wealth, wherewith to buyeven sufficient to satisfy thelr present crauing. Yet he took rio money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner af many, tbe last gilder he had just snatched froin the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mlgbt but be the result of a oertain degree of knowledge, which was not, hawever, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wishedto represent this to his friend, and beg him to resigri that charity and pleasure which proued the ruin of all, and did not tendto his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his sriend would glve him some opportunity of speclking frankly and openly to hlm; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and am idst the various wild and rich soenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke les\u017f lhan his lip; and though Aubrey was neclr the ohiect of his cvriofity, he ohtained no greater gratification from it than the conslant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystcry, which lo his cxal ted imagination began ta assume the appearance of something superncltural.\nThey soon arrived clt Rome, and Aubrey for a time lo\u017ft sight of his companion; he left him ln daily attendanee upon the rnorning circle of an Italian covntess, whilst ho went in search of the memorials afanother almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with cager impatience; the first was srain his sister, breathing nathirig but affection; the others were from his guardians,the latter astonished him; if it had beforeentered into hif jmagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, thcse seemed to give bim fufficient reason sor the belief. His guardians insisted upon his lmmediately leauing his friond, and urged, tbat his character was dreadfully vicious, for lhal the possesslon of irresistlble powers of seduction, rendered bis licenliouf habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that bis coritempt for the adultress had not origiriated in hatred of her character; but tbat he had reqvired, to enhance his grallfication, tbat hisvictim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled fr0m the pinnacle of unsullicd uirtue, down to the lowest aby ss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thal all those females whom behod sought, apparently 0n account of their virtue, had, since his departvrc, thrown euen the mask aside, and had n0t scruplcd to expose the wholo desormily of tbeir vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on wbich lo rest the eye. He resol ved to invent some plauslble pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in tbe mean whiIe, to watch him more closely, and to let rio slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work vpon lhe inexperience of the daughter of the lady whosehovse he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged t0 carry on his plons in secret; but Aubrey's eye foIlowed him in all his windings, and soon discavered that an assignation had 6een appoirited, which would rnost likely end in tho ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartmenl of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he wa\u017f aware of his being about to ineet her lhat uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon suoh an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended t0 marry her, merely lclugbed. Au6rey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek olher apartments, and calling upon the mathcr of the Iady, informed hor of all he knew, nat only with regard to her doughter, but also concerning the cha racter of his Lordship. The assignatjon was prevcnted. Lord Rvthven next day morely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did nothint any suspicion oshis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps towards Greece, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then flxed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory vpon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chranicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselve\u017f beneath tbc sheltering soil or many coloured Iichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing ta pourtray on canvclss the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belorig to those wh0 bad no souls. As she danced upon tbe plain, or tripped alo ng the mountain's side, one would have tbought the gclzello a poor lype of her beauties; for who would hove excbanged her eye, ap parently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited bul to the laste of an epicure. The light step os Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after aritiquities, and often would tbe unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit af a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole bcauty of her form, flaating as it were upon the wind, to the eoger gaze of hjm, who forgot the letters he had jusl decypbered upon an almost effaced tablet, iri the contemplatlon af her sylph-like figure. Often would hor tressef falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fadjng huef, it might well excvse the forgetfulness of the antlquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before lhought of vilal importarice to thc proper intcrpretatiori of a passage jn Pau\u017fonias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfocted by erowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst be drew thofe remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for hjs future hours, fhe would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the fcenes of ber natlve plaoe; \u017fhe wou1d tbon describe to him lhe circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hiin in all the glowing colours of yovthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered uiewirig in bor i nfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greator impression upori her mind, would tell him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earneftness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited tbe interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him tbe tale of the livirig vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and deorest ties, forced every yeor, by feedlng upon lhe life os a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whi1st he attempted to laugh her out 0f such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected 0ne living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and childreri had been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, fhe begged af him to believe her, for it had 6een, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confes\u017f it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appoarance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly oceurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, thal there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same timc he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAvbrey began to attach himself more and more to Ionlho; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected vlrtues of the women among whom he had sought for his visiori of ramance, won his heart; and while he ridicvled the ideo of o young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still be found bimself moreand more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming o plan for some antiquarian resoarch, he wovld depart, determined not to return until his object was attainod; but he always fovnd it impossible to fix his attention upori the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retoined an imoge that seemed al0ne the rightful po\u017fsessor of his lboughts. Iarilhe was vnconscious of his love, and was ever tbe same frank irifantile being he had first known. Sbe always seemed lo part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had rio longer any orie with whom she could visit her favourite havnts, whilst her guardian was 0ccupied in sketching or uncovering \u017fome fragment whjch had yet escaped the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject os Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their cxistenee, pole with borror at the vory name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon onc of his excurfions, which was to detain hjm for cl sew hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once bcggod of hirn not to retvrn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where rio Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considercltion. They described it as the resort of tho vampy res in their nocturnal orgies, clnd denounced the mo\u017ft heavy evils as impending upon him who dar ed to crofs their path. Aubrey made light of their reprefentationf, and tried to laugb them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus t0 mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their bload frce2c, he was silent.\nNexl morning Aubroy set off upori his excursion unattended; he wos surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, ond was coneemed to find that his words, mocking the beljef of those horrib1e fiends, had inspired them wilh such terror. Wben he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the \u017fidc of his borfe, arid earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to 6e put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon ond, and lhat in tbe horizon there was one of those specks which, lnthe warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous inass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counlry.\u2014He at last, however, rnounled his horse, dotermined to make up by speed for hif delay: but it was too late. Twilight, jn these southern climates, if almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: ond ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an lntcrval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain foroed its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning feemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly hjs horse took sright, and he was corriod with dreadsul rapidity through thc entangled f0resl. The anlmal at Iast, through fatigue, stopped, arid he found,by tbe glare of lighlning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of ahovel that bardly lifted itself up from the massos of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find soine one to guide him to the town, or at least trustjng to abtain sbeltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moinent silent, alIowed him to hear the dreadfvl shrieks 0f a woman mingling with the stiflcd, exuItant mockery os a lclugh, continued in one alm0st unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled ouer his head, he, wjth a sudden efforl, forced open the door af the hut. He found himsols in vtter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, clnd no notioe wcls taken of him. He found himself in c0ntact with some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a voice cried, \"Agoin baffled!\" to which a laud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his llfe as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wos in vclin: he was lifted from his seet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy lhrew himself upon him, and kneeling upon hif breast, had placcd his hands upon his lhroat\u2014wben the glare of many torches penetrating through the hale that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a mo ment the crclshirig of the branchos, a\u017f he broko through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm waf now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the Iight of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every jndividual strow with hoavy flakes of soot. At the desire os Aubrey thoy searched for her who had atlracted him by her cries; he was again lcft iri darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form 0f bis fair conductress brought in a lifeless eorse. He shut his eyes, hoping lhat jt was bul a visi on arising from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unolosed them, stretcbed 6y his side. There wos no colour upon hcr cheek, riot even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess about her face that seemed almost as attaohing as the life that once dweIt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veiri:\u2014to this thc meri poinled, cryirig, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was lclid by the sjde of her who had latoly been to him the obiect of sa many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flowor of life that bad died witbin her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed lo shun reflection, and take rcfuge in vacancy\u2014he held a1most unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular con\u017ftruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soori met by different parties who had been engaged in the seclrch of her wbom a mother bad missed. T heir lamentable cries, as they approached lhe city, forewarned the parents of some droadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe thelr grief would be impossibIe; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they lo0kedat Aubrey, and pointed to the oarse. They were inconsalable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a mo\u017ft vio1ent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountclble combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare lhe being he loved. At other tirnes he w0uld imprecate maledictions upon hls head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrjve at Athens, and, from whatcver motive, upon hcaring of lho state os Aubrey, immedicltely placed himself in the same house, and became his constanl attendant. When the latter recovored frorn his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of hirn whose image he had now combined with that 0f a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthuen, by his kind words, iinplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their scparation, and still more by the attenti0n, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled hlrn to his presence. His lord\u017fhip seemed quito changed; he no lorigcr appcared that apathetic boing who hod so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired jnto the same stato of mind, arid Au6rey pereeived n0 dlfferencc from the former man, except that at timef he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him,with a smile of malieious exultation playlng upon his lips: he kriew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last slage of the invalid's recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watehing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of those arbs, circling,like our warld, the movoless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid lbe eyes of clll.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, wcls much weakened, and that elafticity of spirit which had once so distinguished hjm now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silence clsLord Ruthvon; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly freqvented, Ianthe's form sto0d by his side\u2014if he s0ught it ln the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning r0und, would show, to hls wild imagjnation, ber pale face and wounded throat, with cl meek smile upan her lips. He determined lo fly sceries, every feature of which created svch bitter asfocjali0ns in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had takon os him during his illness, that they should visit thoseparts of Greeoerieither had yet feen. They travellcd in cvery direclion, and sought every spot to which arecollection c0uld be otlacbed: but though theythus hastened from place to plaee, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but thcy gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagiried were only thc lrivention of indiuiduals, whose interest il was to excite thc generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dange rs. In consequerice of thus neglecting tbe advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they trauelled with only a fcw gvards, more lo serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed ofa torrent, with large masfcs of rock brought down from the rieighhouring precipices, they bad reason la repent their negligence; for scarcely were the w hole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun lo fire in lhe directjon whence the report eame. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating tbeir example, retired f0r a moment behind the she1tering turn of thedefile: bvt ashomed of being thus detained by a foe, who wilh insulting shouls bade them advance, and beirig exposed to unresisting slaughter, is any af lhe robbcrs sb ould climb above and take thcm jn the rear,they determined al once lo rush sorward in search 0f the enemy. Hardly had tbey loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in the shoulder, whicb brought him to the ground. Auhrey bclstened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest ar his own peril, was soon surprised by seejng the rabbers' faces around him\u2014hjs guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's bejng wounded, immediateIy thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of greclt reward, Aubrey soon induced them to corivey his wounded friend to a neighbouring eabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thejr pre\u017fence\u2014they being content mere1y to gvard the entrance till their comrade sh0uld return with the promis ed sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strengtb rapidly decreased; iri tw0 days mortification ensued, and death seemed advaricing with hasty steps. His conductand appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had 6een of tbe abjccts about him: but towards the close of the 1ast evening, his mind became appareritly uneasy, and his eye ofton fixcd upon Aubrey, who was indueed to offer his ossistance with more than usual earnestnoss\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do inore than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death ofmy existcnce as little as tbat of the passi ng day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? telI me how? I would do any thing,\" rep1ied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my llfe ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal oll you know of me, my honaur were free from \u017ftain in the worId's mouth\u2014and if my deoth were unknawn for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It \u017fhclll not be known.\"\u2014\"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, raising hlmself with exullant vialence, \"Swear by allyour soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a ycar and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hi\u017f piIlow, and breathed no rnore.\nAu6rey retired to rest, butdid not sleep; themany circumslances attending his acquaintanco with this man rose upon bis mind,and he knew not why; when he remembered his aclth a cold shivering came over him, as if from the prosontiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early jn the morning, he was about to enter lhe hovel in which he had lefl tbe corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it wa\u017f no longer therc, having been conveyed by himsclf and comrades, upon his reliring, to the pinnclcle of a nejghbouring mount, according to cl promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the firsl cold ray af the moan that rose after his death. Aubrey ostonished, and takjng several of the men, determined to go and bury it upan the spot where it lay. But, when be had mounted ta the summit he found no trace of ejlher the corpse or thc clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out thc identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mlnd was bewildered in conjectures, but heat last returned, convinced that they bad buried the corpse sor the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in whicb ho had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apporenlly corispjred to helghten that superstitious meIancholy that hcld seized upon his mlnd, be rosoIved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna.Wbilc waiting for a vesse1 to convey him ta Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effecls he had withhim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbings there was a caso containing severol weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what wa\u017f his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamerited in the same style as the daggerdiscovered in the fatol but\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gajn further proof, he fourid tbe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. Hls eyes seemed to need no furtber certainty\u2014lhey seemed gazlng to be bound to the dagger; yet still hewifhed to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of b1ood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his woy home, at Rame, his firft inquiries were ooncerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents wcre jn distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heclrd 0f since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beeame almost broken under so many repeated horr0rs; be was afraid that this lady had fallen a victirn to the destroyer of Ianthe. He beoame morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postllions, as if he were golng to save the life of same one he held dear. He arrived clt Calais; a breeze, which seemed obediont to his wlll, soon wafted him to the English fhores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a m0ment, appeored to lose, in tbe embraces and caresses of his sistcr, all memory of the past. If she before, by her insclntine caresses, had gained his clfsection,now that the womanbegan to appeor, she was still more atlacbing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assernblies.There was none os that light brilliancy wbich only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowdod apartmcnt. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of lhe mind beneath. Thero was a melancholy charm about itwhich did not seem to arise srom misfortune,hut from some foeling wlthin, that oppeared to indjcate a soul coriscjous of a brighlcr realm. Her step was not that light f0oting, which strays whcre'er a bvttcrfly or a colaur may attract\u2014it was sedate arid pen\u017five. Wben olorie, her face was never brightened by thesmlle of joy; but when her brather hreathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget lhose griefs she knew destroyed his rest, wbo would have exchanged her smile for that 0f the volvptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014lhal face wero then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Shewas yet only eightoen, and hod not been presented to the world, it having been thougbt by ber guardiclns more fit that her presentation sh0uld be de1ayed until her brother'\u017f return from the continenl, when he might be her proteetor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was faft approacbing, should be the epoch of her entry int0 the \"bvsy scene.\" Auhrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers,and fed upon the melancholy wbich overpowered him. He could not fcel interest aboul the frivoIities 0f fashionoble strangers, when his mind had been so torn by lbe eventf he had witnessed; bvt he determined to sacrifice bis own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in t0wn, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe orowdwas excessive\u2014a drawing-roomhad not boen held for a long time,and aIl who were anxious to bask in the sinile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a cornor by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remem6rclnce that the sirst tiine ho had seen Lord Ruthven waf in thclt very place\u2014he felt himsels suddenly \u017feized by the arm, and a voice he recognized tao wel1, sounded in hiscar\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courageto turn, fearful of seoing a speelre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, tbc same figure which had attracted hif notice on this spot upon his first enlry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their wcight, he was a6liged to take the orm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, hethrew himself inlo his carriage, ond was driven horne. He paced the room withhurried steps, and fixed his hands upon bis head, as if he were afraid his thoughls were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started vp in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oalh.\u2014He roufed himself, he could ri0t believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thovght his imagination had conjured up the image his mind waf re\u017fting upon.It was impo\u017fsible that it could bo real\u2014he delermined, therefore, to go again into society; for though be attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the riame hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gainjng informalion. He went a few nights after with his sister lo the assembly of a near relation. Leauing her under thc protection 0f a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave bimself up to his own devovring thoughts. Percejving, at last, lbat many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anotber r0om, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently iri earne\u017ft conversation; he attempted lo pass and get near her, when one, wham he reqvested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those foatures he most abborred. He s prang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, witb hurried step, forced her towards the\u017ftreet: at the door be found himself impedcd by the crowd of servants who were wajting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remcmberyour oalh!\"\u2014He did not dare ta tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey become almost dislracted. If before hif mind hod been absorbed by one subject, how much more e0mpletely was it engrossed, now that the certainty 0f tho monster's living ogain prossed upon his thoughts. Hif sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused bis abrupt conduct. He only utlcred a few words, and those terrified her. The more hethought, the more he wa\u017f bewildered. His oath startled hlm;\u2014was he then to alIow this rnorister to roam, 6earing ruin upon his breath, amjdst all he heId dear, and not avert its progress? His uery sistor might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspioions,who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from sucb a wretch; hut death, he remembercd, had beeri already mocked. For days he remajned in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sistcr caine, who, with cyes streaming with teors, besought him, for her \u017fake, to support nature. At laft, no lon ger capable of bearing stillness and folitude, he left his houfe, roamed from street t0 street, anxious to fly thclt image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe inidnighl damps. He was rio longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him dowri to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiou\u017f for hlssafety, einployod people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled fram a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, bowever, suddenly cbonged. Struck with the idea that he lest by his absence the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconfcious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch hjm closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of bis oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached withintimacy. But when he entered intoa room, bis haggard and suspiciou\u017f loaks were fo striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his \u017fister was at last obliged t0 beg of himto abstain from seeking, for her sake, asoclety whichaffected hlm fo strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailirig, the guardians thought proper to interp-\nose, clnd, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again thot trust whicb had been bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's pclrents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, clnd of prevonting him from exposing ta the gene ral eye those morks of what they considered folly, they engageda physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was hi\u017f mind ab\u017forbed by one terrible subject. His incohe rence became at last so greal, that ho was confined to his chamber. Thero he wauld often lie for dayf, incapable of being roused. He had become emociated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the orily sign os affection and recollection rcmaining displayed itself upon tho entry af hls sister; then hc would sometimes start, and, selzing her harids, with looks that seuerely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do riot go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, hls orily anfwer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however,as the year was passing, his incoherences became 1ess frequent, clnd his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observe d, that severa1 times in the day he would count upon his fingers a defiri ite number, arid then smilc.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of hi\u017f guardians entering his room, began to canverse witbhis physician upon the melancholy circumstance os Aubrey's boing in so awsul a situation, when his slster was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glcld of thifmark of retuming intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentionod the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thlnkingthis was ayoung Earl wbom he had met with in society, Aubrey soemed pleased, and astonjshed them slilI more 6y his expressing his intention to be presont at the nuptiols, and dcsiring to see his sistor. They answered not, but in a few minules his sister was with him. He wcls apparently again oclpable of being affected by the influence os her lovely smile; for hc pressed her to hisbreast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought os her br0ther's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriagc with a person so distingvlshed far rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locketupon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beho1ding the features of the monsler who had \u017fo long influenced hi\u017f life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orid trampled it vnder foot. Upon her asklng him wby he thus destroyed the resemblance 0f her suture husband, he looked as if he did not undersland ber\u2014then seizing her hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expression of counlenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, sor he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014il seemcd as is that voice ag ain bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly rourid, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw rio one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the wholc, and thoughl this wa\u017f but a return of hi\u017f diforder, entered, and f0rcing him from Miss Aubrcy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, hc begged of lhem to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanily they imogined had taken possession of his mirid, cndeavoured to pacify hjm, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one e1so. When he heard os Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the oause of it; but when he learned tbat he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be conoealed froin those among whom he had gained this information. Hc hastened to the house of his f0rmer companion, and, by constant atteridance, and the pretence of great affcetion far the brotber and interest in his f atc, he gradually won the ear of Mjss Aubrey. Wh0 could resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils lo recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual havjng no syrnpathy with any being on the cr0wdod earth, save with her to whom he addrossed himself;\u2014covld tell how, since he knew her, his exislence, had begun to soem worthy 0f preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's art, or such was the wi1l of fate, that he gajned her affeotions. The title of the elder branch fa1ling al lcngth to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marr iage, (in spite of hcr br0ther's deranged state,) which was to take place the veryday before his dcparture for the continent.\nAubrey, whcn he was lest by the physician and his guardians, attemplcd to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen andpaper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuring ber, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour os those now in tbe gravo, who oncc held her iri lheir arms os their hope and the hope of lheir houso, to delay bul for a few bours that marriage, on which he denounced lhe most heovy cur\u017fes. The servants pramised they would delivcr jt; 6vt gjvlng it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, wbat he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pa\u017fsed on without rest to the husy inmatef of the hauso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may moro easjly be conceiued than described, the notes of busy preparatjon. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon hif ear. Aubreygrew alinost frantic. The curioslty os the servanls at last avercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tho custody of on helpless old wornan. He seizod the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and jn a moment found himse1f in the apartment where all were near1y assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, spceohless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his eclr\u2014\"Remember your oalh, and know, if n0t my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women arc frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, rou\u017fed by the old woinan, had eome in soarch os him. Avbrey cauld no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a hlood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. Tbis was not mentioned to hjs sister, who was not present when he entered, os tho physician was afroid of agitating her. The marrjage was solemnized, and lhe bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increafed; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians migbt be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader bas perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians bastened ta protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappearcd, and Aubrey'f si\u017fter had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE INTHE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of resl, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, jn the island of that name. The beavty of thif place, and the certain supply of cclttle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce mariy Briti\u017fh vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and mercharitmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom os the bay, and whilst the men were emplayed in watering, arid the purser bargaining f0r cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to thc eave called Homer's Scbool,arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule sonamed) we met with and engclged a young Gr eek as our guide, who toIdus he had come from Scio witb an English lord, who left the island s0ur days previousto our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me witb hjm; bvt I did not choose lo quit Mltyleno, where I am likcly to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottagc over the bill, facing lhe river, belongs to him,and he has left an old mari iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcr, six hundred zoehines for it, (clhout L25O English currency,) ond has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not constantly; for he soils in his felvcca very often to the djfferent islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity uery much, and we Iost no time in hastening to the house where our cauntrymarihad resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mclnsion. It consisted of four apartrnents on lhe ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with o spacious closet annexed. They were all simply dccorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables ori either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the brancbes by moving a spring fixed in the side af a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa coinpleted the furniture. In the hall stood half a do2en English cane chajrs, and an empty book-case: thcre were no mirrors, nor a single pclinting. The bedchamber had merely o large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottonquilts and a pilIow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sittlng-room we obse rved a marble rece\u017fs, formerly, the old man tald us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the cl0set: it was operi, but we did not think ourseIves justified in examining the content\u017f. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsfeou's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Ziminermon, in the German language; Klopslock'f Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schjller'splcly of theRohbers; MiIton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek pross at Constantinople, much torn, 6ut no English bo0k of clny description. Most of these books wore filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ilalian arid Latin. The Mossiah was literally scribbIed all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"Thelord had been reading these books the evening before be sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bul,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing wilhovt orders, be would frowri upon me for a week together; he is 0therways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a sma1l eottage jn tbe wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanaple; I don't know for whal reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pIeasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the f1uted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornioes, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) wero consjderably higher than the roos. The roof, surrourided by a light st0ne balustrade, was coveredby a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strorig coarse linen. Most 0f the bouse-t0ps ore thus furnished,as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in sinoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying lhe everiing breeze.\nOn the left harid as we enterod the house, a small streamlot glided away, grapes, oranges andllmes were cluslering together on itf borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe feat with an ornamentaI wooden back waf placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twclve o'clock, reading, wriling, and lalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said tho old mon, \"prayirig\" for he wcls very devout, \"and always atterided our chvrch lwice a week, hesides Sundays.\"\nThe view fram this seot was what may be terrned \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich uineyords led the eye to Mount Calclo, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of whjch an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A s mall stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the wood\u017f near the mountairi'sbase. The sea smooth as glass, and an horjzon unshadowed by a single eloud, terminates the view in front; and o ljttle on the le ft, through a vista of lofty chesriut arid palm-trees, several small islands wcre distinctly observed, studding the light bluc wave with spots of emerald green. I seld0m enjoyed a view more than I did this; bul our enquirjes were fruitless a\u017f to lhe name of the person who had resided in this romclntic solitvde: none knew hif nclme but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" faid our coriductor, \"covld tcll, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannol y0u tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" sajd he, \"I dare not.\" We hcld not time to visit lhe Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnl several particulars os thc isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon he was last upon the island, clnd cven danced with them at the nuptial seast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and colton and si1k to lhe girlf who live by weaving these articles. Hc alsa bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gaIe, and be osten gaue Greek Testaments to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared to us, srom all we collected, to have been a very ecoentrie arid berieuolent charaoter. One circumstance we leornt, which our old friend at the cottage lhought praper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the Iord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had hought her a piano-forte, and taught her bimself the use of it.\nSuch was the informalion with which we departed from the peaceful isle os Mitylene; our imaginations al1 on the rack, guesslng who this rambler in Grecce could be. He bad money it was ovi dent: he had pbilclnthr0py of disposition, and all th0se eccentrjcities which mark peouliar genius. Arrjved atPalermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in compclny with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individu al,\" sajd be, \"about whom you are so arixious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travel\u017f on the island of Tenedos, and I a1sa visited him al Milylone.\" We had never then heord of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from homc; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put into 0ur hands we recognized the recluse os Calcla in every page. Deep1y did we regret not having been more curious iri our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some fulurc day; 6ut to me that day wilI nover return. I make this statement, believing it not qujte uninterestirig, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has heen grasfly slaridored. He hcls been described as of an urifeeling disposition, auerse to associating with human nature, or contributing in ony way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plain1y gathered from these little anecdotes. All tbe siner feelings of thc heart, so elegantly depicted in his lardship's poems, seem to hclve their seat in his bosom. Teriderness, sympathy, and chority appeor togvido all his actions: and his eourting the repose of salitude is an addilional reason for mar king him as a being ori whose heart Religion hath set her seol, clnd ovcr whose head Benevolence hath tbrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respcct lo his lovcs or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be roceiued with caution, partjcularly when directed againft man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censurc the errors of a fell0w-mortal. Lord Byron's eharacter is worthy of his genivs. To do good in secret, ond shun the world's applause, is the furest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.","28":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Williain Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon which this tale is founded is very general in tbe East. Among the Arabians it appears lo be common: it did not, however, exterid itself to the Greeks unt il after the esta6lishment of Christianity; ond it has orily assumed its present forin since the division of the Latin and Greok ohurohes; at wbich time, the idea he ooming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if bvried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forined the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising froin their gravcs, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, P0land, Austria, and Lorraine, whe re the beljef existed, that vampyres riightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who hocame cmacialed, lost their strength, and speedily died af consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veinf became distended to such a state 0f repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and oven from the very pores of thoir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiouf, and, of course, credihle account of a pclrticular case os vampyrism, whicb is stoted to baueoccurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upan cln examination os the commander-in-chief and magjstrates of the placo, they positively and unanimovsly affirmed, that, about five year\u017f before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had beeri heord to say, that, clt Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Tvrkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating \u017fome of lho earth out of tbe vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not preuent him from becoming a vampyre hirnself; for, about twenty 0r thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complalned of having been lormented by hirn, and a deposition was made, that fovr persons had been doprived of Iife by his attackf. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having oonsuIted their Hadagni, taok up lhe body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cases of vampyrjsm) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and cars, pureand florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accvstomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body os Arnold Pclul, at which he is reported to have oried out as dreadfully as if he had boen alive. This done, they cut off his head, bvrned his body, arid threw the ashes lnto his grave. The same measures were adopted with the oarses of those persans who had previously died fram vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that o person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himfelf, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThif monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted toilIustratc thesubject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts os Grocce it if considered as a sort os punishment after death, for some heirious crime committed whilst in existenco, thclt the deceased js not only doomed to vampyrise, but compollcd to confine hls infornal visitations solely to th ose beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014th0se to whom ho was bound by ties of kindrcd and asfection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first onearth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse sha1l from its toinb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the nativeplaco, And suck the blood of all thy raoe; There froin thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loalhe the banquet which perforce Mvst feed thy livid living corse, Thy victim\u017f, ere they yet expire, Shall know the de mon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bl ess thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in slame! Yel thou must end thy task and mark Hcr cheek's last tinge\u2014ber eye's last spark, And the laft glassy glarice must vjew Which freezes o'erits lifoles\u017f blue; Then with unhallowed hand shal1 tear Tho tresses os her yellow hair, Of which, in lise a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is barne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet wilh thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard ljp; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more acoursed than they.\nMr. Southey has olso introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thcllaba,\" the vampyrecorsc of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is repres ented as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilft in existonce. Butthjs cannot be supposed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of hcr life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as cl complete type of purily arid innocence. The veracious Tournesort glves a long accovnt in his travelf of severaI astonishing cases of vampyrifm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Ca1met, in his great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, clnd traditionary narratives illuftrative of its effects, has put forth some leclrned dissortations, tendi ng to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible svperstitjon inight be added; tbough the present may suffice for tho limits of a note, necessarily deuoted to explariation, and which may now be concluded hy mcrely remarking, that thovgh the term Vampyro is the one in most general acoeptatjon, there are several others synonyinous with it, made use os in various parts 0f tbe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoul acha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened thot in the midft of tho disslpations attendant upori a London winter, there appeared at the various pclrtics of thc leaders of the tori a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, thari his rank. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he oould not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter os the fair only attracted bis attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear irito those breasts where thoughtlessnoss rcigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: \u017fomc attributed it to thedead grey eye, whioh, fixing upon tbe object's facc, did not seem to penetrate, and at onc glance to pierce through to the iriward workings of the hcart; hut fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that wejghed upon lhe skin it could nol pass. His pecuIiaritios caused bim to be lnvited to every house; all wished to see him, and thosc who had been accustomed lo v iolent excitemont, and now felt the weight 0f erinui, were pleased at bavirig something in their presence capable of erigaging their attention. In spite of the dcadly huo of his face, which riever gajned a warmer tint, either frorn the blush 0f modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form clnd outline were bcautiful, many of the female hunters after riotoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they mighl term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monftor shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though invain:\u2014when she ftood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixedupon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudenee was baffled, and she left the fiold. But though lhe common adultress could not influenee even the guidance of his eyes, it wa\u017f not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to tbo virtuous wife and innocent daughter, lhat few knew he ever addressed hiinself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winnjng tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or tbat they were mov ed by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those femclles who form the boa\u017ft of thelr sex fram their domestic virtues, as among th0se who sully it by their vices.\nAbo vt the same time, there came to London a yaunggentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whilo he was yet in childhood. Lefl also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duly merely to take care os his fortune, while they relinquishod the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltems, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, bence, that high romantic feeling of honour ond candour, whieh daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He beIieved cll1 to sympathise wjth uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effecl of the scene, as we see in r0monees: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothcs, whicb were as warm, but which were better adapted to the paintor's cyeby their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, lhat the dreams of poets were the realities of Ilfe. He was hand\u017fome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering int0 the gay circles, many molhers surrounded him, striving whjch fhoulddescribe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at the same time, by their brightening countenances when heapproachcd, and by their spclrklingeyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into f cllse riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he wasto the romance os his solitary hours, he was startled atfinding, that, except in the ta1law and wax candles lhat flickored, not from the prescnce of aghosl, but from want of snuffing, there was no faundation in real life for any of that congerjes af pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Firiding, howevcr, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish hjs dreams, wben the extraordinary being we have above descri6ed, crossed him in his cclreer.\nHe watched him; and the very iinpossibillty of forming ari ldea of the cbaracter of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other slgns of his observatian of extemal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by lbe avoidance of their c0ntact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattercd its propensity to extravagant ideas, be saon f0rmed this object irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring 0f his foncy, r ather than the person before him. He became acqvainled wilh bim, paid him attentions, clnd so far advanced upon bis riotice, that his presence was always recognjsed. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were einbarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preporation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Deflrous os gaining some iriformation respecting this singuIar charoeter, who, till now, bad only whetted hls curiosity, he binted to his guardiaris, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rclpid steps in tbe career of vice towards putting themselves upan an equality with the aged, and nol alIowing thern to appear as if fallen from the skies, wheneuer scandalous intrigues aro mentioned af lho subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying lhem on. They consented: and Avbrey immediately mcntjoning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised lo reeeive from him aproposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem froin bjm, who, apparently, had nothing iri common wilh other inen, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHjtherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthuen's oharacter, and now he found, thal, thovgh many more of his ocl-\nions were cxposed to his view, the results offered different conclusjons from the apparcnt motlves to his conduct. His companion was profusein his liberality;\u2014the id1e, the vagabond, and the beggar, received fram his hand more than enough to relieue their immediate wants. But Auhrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virlue, that he 6estowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly \u017fuppressed sneers; butwhen the profligate came lo ask s0mething, not to relieve his wants, bul to clll0w him to wallow in his lust, or to sink bim still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the viciovs, whieb generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumslance about the chority of his Lordship, which was still more impressed vpon his mind: all those up0n whom it was bestowed, inevitably faund that there was a curse upon it, for they were all eilher led to tbe scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other t0wns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion foughl for the centres of all fashi0nable vice; thore he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betled, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; 6ut it was always with tbe sameunehanging face, wjth whicb he generally watched the society around: it was not, howover, so when he encovnterod the rash yauthful novice, orthe luckless father of a numerovs family; theri his very wish seemed forlune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of inind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more firethan tbat of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the f0rmerly asfluent youth, torn from the c ircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the falo that had drawn hlm wilhin the reacb of this fierid; whilst mony a sather sat frantic, omjdst tbe spoakirig look\u017f of muto hungry chlldren, wilhout a single farthirig of his late immcnse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their presorit craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost,to tbe ruiner 0f many, the last gilder he had just snatchod from theconvulsive grclsp of the innocerit: tbis mighl but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of oombating the cunning of the more experjenced. Aubrey often wi\u017fhed to represent lhis to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure whioh proved the ruin of all, and did n0t tend to his own proflt;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speoking frankly and opcnly to him; h0wever, this never occurred. Lard Ruthven in his carriage, and omidst the variovs wild and rich sccnes of nclture, was always the same: his eye spoke le\u017fs than his lip; arid though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the coristant exciternent of voin1y wishing to break that mystery, which to his exoltod imaginalion began to assume the appearance os fomething supernaturol.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of hls compclnion; he left bjm iri daily attondance upon the morning circle of an Italian cauntess, whilst he went in search of the rnemorials of another almost deserted oity. Whjlst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eagerimpatience; the first was fr0m his sister, brealhing nothing but affeclion; lhc others were from his guardians, the Iattcr astonifhed him; if jt had before entered lnto his imagiriation that therc was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately loaving his srjend, and urged, that his characler was dreadfulIy vicious, for that the possession os irresisti6lc powers of seduction, rendered hif licentiou\u017f hablts more dangerous to society. It had bcen discovered, that his contcmpt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; bvt that he had reqvired, ta enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guiIt, shovld be hurled from the pinnaole of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest clbyss of insamy and degradation: in fine, that al1 th0se sernales whom he had sought, appclrently on account of their virtue, had, slnce hjs departure, thrown even the mask aside, and hcld not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the pubIic gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whofe character had not yet shown a single brighl point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent somc plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circum\u017ftances pass 6y unnoticed. He entered into the same circ1e, and \u017foon perceived, that hi\u017f Lordship was erideavouring to work upon the inexpcrience of the daughter of the lady whose houfe he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it is \u017fe1dam that an unmarried femaIe is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged to carry on bis plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windirigs,and soon discovered lhat an assignation had been appointed, which would rnost likeIy end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing na lime, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and ahrupt1y asked him his inlentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time lhat he was aware of his being about to meet her tbat vory night. Lord Ruthven onfwered, that his inlentlons were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whe ther he inlended to marry her, inerely laughed. Aubroy retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that momerit be must declineaccompariying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant t0 seek othor apartments, and colling upon tbc mother of the lady, informod her of all he kriew, not only with rcgard to her daughter, but also ooncerning the character of his Lordship. The assignationwas preverited. Lord Ruthven next day merely \u017ferit his \u017fervant to notify his complete assent to a separatlon; but did not hint any suspjcion af his plclns having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHavirig left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and cr0ssing tbc Periinsula, soon sound hjmself at Athen\u017f. He then sixed his resldencc in the house of a Greek; ond soon occupied himself in traeing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only beso rc slaves, had hidden themselvef beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured liehen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful ond delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wisbing to pourtray ori carivass the promisod hope of the foithfuI in Mahomet's parodise, saue that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to thjnk she could belong to those who hadno souls. As she danced upon the plain, or trippedalong the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazel1e a poor type of her beaulies; forwho would have exchanged her eye, apporently thc eye of aniinated naturc, for that sleepy lvxuriouf look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epieure. The light step of Iantbe 0ften accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncoriscious gjrl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beavty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the eagor gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had iust decyphered upan an cllmosl effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figvro. Often would her trcsses falling, as she flitted araund, oxhihit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swlftly fading hues, it might well excuse lho forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape fram his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importanceto the proper iriterpretation ofa passago in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-roams and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a mernorial f0rbis future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic esfects of his perici1, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hirn the circling dancc upon the open plain, would paint, to hjm in aIl the gl0wing colours of youlhful memory, the marrlage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to svbjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell himall the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her eamestness and apparenl be1ief of what sbe narraled, ex cited thc interest even of Aubrey; and often as she toId him the tale of the liuing varnpyre, who had pa ssed years amidst hjs friends, and dearest tie\u017f, forced every year, by feeding upon tho life of a lavely fomale to prolong his existence forthe ensuing months, bis blaod wou ld run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; hut Ianthe cited to hjm the names of old men, who had at last detected 0ne livirig among lhernselves, after several of tbeir near relatlves and children had been found marked with the stamp of lhe fiend's appetite; and when she found him \u017fo incredulous, fhe begged of him to belieue hor, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alway\u017f had some proof given, which obllged them, with grlef and heartbreaking, to confesf jt wa\u017f true. She detailed to him the tradilional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descriptiori of Lord Ruthven; he, howevcr, stilI persisted in persuading her, that thorc could be no truth in her fears, tbough at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural p0wer of Lord Rvtbven.\nAubrey bogan to attclch himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the wamen among whom bo had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; ond while he ridiculed the ideo of a young man af English habits, marryirig an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form 6efore him. He wauld tear himself at timcs from her, and, sorming a plan sor fome antiquarian research, he wovld depart, determined riot to return until his obiect was attained; but he alway\u017f found it impossihle t0 fix hi\u017f attention upon the ruins around him, whilft in his mind he rotained an image that seemed alone the rightfvl posse\u017fsor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile bejng ho had first knowri. She always seemedto part from him with reluctance; bvt il was because she had no longer any onc with whom she could visit ber favourite haunt\u017f, whilst her guardiari was occupied in sketching or uncovcring some frogmenl which had yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. She had appea1ed to hcrparents on the subject 0f Vampyres, and lhey 6otb, with several present, affirmed lheir exjstence, pale with horror at lhc very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon 0ne of his excursioris, which waf to detain him for a few hours; wben they beard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, af he mvst necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, ofter the day had el0sed, upon any conslderation. They described it as the resort 0f thc vainpyref in thelr nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impendjng upon him who dared to cr0ss their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, ond tried to laugh them out of the jdea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thvs to mock a superior, inferrial power, the very nameaf which apparently mode their bIood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had infpired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eamestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014ho pr0misod. He wos, h0wever,so occupied in his reseorch, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, arid that in the harizori thcre was one of those spccks whieh, in the warmer c1imates, so rapidly gath er into a tromendous rnas\u017f, and pour all thoir rage uponthe devoted c0untry.\u2014He al last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twiligbt, in those sovthern climates, is alm0st uriknown; immedialely the sun sets, njghl begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wcls abave\u2014its echoing thunders had scareely an interval of rest\u2014lts thick heavy rclin forced its way through the canopying soliage, whilst the blue sorked llghtning seemed to fall and radiate at bis very feet. Suddenly bis horse took fright, and ho was carried with dreadfvl rapidity through the entongled forest. The ariimal at last, through fatlgue, stopped, and ho found, by lhe glare of lightning, thot be was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to gu ldc him to the town, or clt least lrufting to obtain shelter from the polting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, clllawed him ta hear the dreodful shrieks of a waman mingling with the ftifled, exultanl mockery of a laugh, contiriued iri one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, ro used by the thunder which again ro1led over his head, he, with a fudderi effort, forced open the door of the hul. He f0und hiinself in utter darkness: the sound, howevor, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, \u017ftill the sovnds continued, and no notice was token of him. Hc sound himself in contact with some one, whom he immediatcly seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whase strength seemed superhuman: delermined to se1l his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet clnd hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014hi\u017f enemy threw himself upon hlm, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up0n his throat\u2014when the glore af many torches penetrating thr0ugh the bole that gave light in tbe day, disturbed him;\u2014he inslantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed lhrough the door, arid in cl moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer hoard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, wassoon heard by tho\u017fe wilbout. They entered; the lighl of their torches fell up0n the mud walls, arid the tbatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of sool. At the deslre af Aubrey they searched for her wbo had attracted him by her cries; he wcls again left in darkness; bul what was his horror, whenthe light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy farm of his fair conduetress brougbt in a lifcless corse. He fhut his eycs, hoping that it was bul a vision arislng frorn his disturbed imaginatiori; but he again saw the same form, wben he unclosed them, stretched by his side. Thcre was no colovr upon her eheek, riot oven vpon her lip; yet thcre was a stillness about her face that seemed alinost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her rieck and breast waf blood, and upon her throat wcre the marks of teeth having operied tbe vein:\u2014ta this tbe men polnted, crying, simu1taneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A Iitter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the fide of her who had lately bcen to hlm tbe object of so many bright and falry vislons, now fa1len with the flowor of life that had died wjthjn her. He know not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to \u017fhun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost uricorisciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the but. They were soon met by diffcrent parties wh0 had been engagedin the seareh af her wbom a mather had missed. Their lainentable cries, os they approached the city, forewarried lhe parents of some dreadful calastrophe. \u2014To desoribe their grief would be impossible; but when thoy ascertaincd the cause of lheir child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse.They wore inconsolable; bolh dicd hroken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized witb a inost violent sever, and was 0ften delirious; in these intervals he w0uld call upon Lord Rutbven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountoble combinatiori he seerned lo beg of his former companian to spare the being he Ioved. At other limes he wo uld imprecate mcl1edictions upon his head, and curse hiin as her deftroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrjve at Athens, and, from whatever rnotive, up0nhearing 0f the state of Aubrey, immedicltely placed himself in thc samo house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter reeovered from his deljrium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him wbose im oge he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven,by his kirid words, implying alm0st repentanoe for the foult that had caused their separation, and \u017ftill more by lhe altentian, anxiety, and care which he showed, soori reconciled him to hls presence. His lordship seemed quite ehanged; hc no longer appeared that clpathelic being who had so aslonished Au6rey; but as soon cls his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived rio differerice from the former man, cxcept that at times hc wassvrprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exuItation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stagc of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity os spirit whichhad once so distinguished him now feemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitudc and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst thc ruins he had sormerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sovght it in tbe woods, her light step wou1d appear wandering amid\u017ft the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; tben suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, hor pale facc clnd wounded t hroat, with a meek smile upori her lip\u017f. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assoclationf in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him dvring his i1lness, that they should visit thofe parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travel1ed in every direction, and sought every spot ta which a recollection covld bc attached: but though lhey thu\u017f ha\u017ftened from placo to place, yet they seemed not to heed what theygazed upon. They heard much of robbers, hut they gradually 6egan to slight lhese reports, which they imagined werc only the invention of individuals, wh0se interest it was t0excite the gerierosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence ofthvs neglectjng tho adviee of the inhabitants, on ane occasi0n they travelled with only a few guards, rnore to serve as gvides than as a deferice. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at lhe bottorn af which was thc bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brougbt down from the neighbouring preclpices, they had reason t0 repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole 0f theparty engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of 6ullets clo\u017fe to their heads, and by tbe echoed report of several gvns. In an instant thcir guardf had loft the m, and, placing themselvcs behind rocks, had begun to fire in tbe direcllon wherice the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering tum of the defile: butashamcd of being lhus detained by a foe, who with insulting shoulf bade thoin advance, and beirig exposed to vnre\u017fisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should c1irnb clbove and take thcm in thc reor, they determinod at once to rush forward in searcb of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of tbe r0ck, whenLord Ruthven received a shot in lhe shoulder, which brought himto the ground. Aubrey hastened t0 his as\u017fistance; and, no longer heeding the coritest or his own peril, was soon furprised by seeing the robbers' faces arovnd him\u2014his guards havjng, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immcdiately lhrown up their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises 0f grcat reward, Aubrey soon induced thom to convey his wounded friend toa neighbouring ca6in; clnd having agreed upon a ransom, he was no rnore dlsturbed by tbeir prefence\u2014they being content merely to gua rd the entrance till their eomrade \u017fhould return with the promised svm, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued,and death seemed advancing wlth hasty steps. His conduct arid clppeararico bad not changed; he seemed as unconsciou\u017f ofpain af he had been of the objeots abaut him: bvt towards the close of the last evenjng, his mind became apparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed vpon Aubroy, who was induced to offer his asslstance witb more than vsval earnestriess\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than thal\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existenoe as 1iltle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my h0nour, your friend's hanour.\"\u2014\"How? telIme how? I wovld do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need 6ut little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if yav would ooncealall you know of mo, my honour were free from stain iri the world's mouth\u2014and lf my death were unkn0wn for some tjme in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisjng himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fears, swear tbat, for a yeclr and cl day you will not impart yaur knowledge of my orimes 0r de ath to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting srom lheir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; hesunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rclired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his inind, and he kncw not why; whon he remernhered his oath a oold shivering came over him, as if from thc presentiment of sornething horrible awaitjng him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when cl robber met bim, and informed him that it wasno longer there, having been conveyed by himsels and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, accordlng to a promise they had giveri his lordship, that it \u017fhovld be exposed to the first eold ray of the inoon that rose aftor his death. Aubrey clstonished, and tak ing severol of the men, determlned to go and bury it upon tho spot where it lay. But, when he had mourited to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or lhe clothes, though therobbers swore they p0irited out the identical rock on which they had Iaid the body. For a liine his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at Iast returried, c0nvinced that they had buried the corpse sor the sake of the clathes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misf0rtunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitiou\u017f melanch0ly that had scized upon his mind, he resoIved to leave it, and soon arrived al Smyrna. While wajting for a uessel ta convey hlm t0 Dtrarito, ar to Naples, he oceupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him 6elonging to Lord Ruthven. Arnongst other things tbore was a case containing sevoral weapons af afferice, more or less adapted to en\u017fure the death of the vjctim. There were soveral daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious sorms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheclth apparontly ornamented in the same stylo as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he sbuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the wcapori, and his horror may be imagined when he disc0vored thal it fitted, though peculiarly \u017fhaped, the sheath ho heId in bis hand. His eyes seemed to needno further cortainty\u2014they seemed ga2irig to be 6ovnd to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the \u017fame varying tints upon lhe haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way hoine, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snotch from Lord Rvthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard os slnce the departure of his lordsbip. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so manyrepealed horrors; he wcls af raid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He beeame morose and silent; and his only occupation consistod in urging the speod os the postllions, as if he were going t0 save the life of some one he held dear. He arrjved at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to thc mansion of his fathers, and there, for a m0ment, appcared to lose, in the embraces and caresses os his si\u017ftor, all memory of the past. If sbe before, by her infantine caresses, had gairied bis affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaehing as a eompaniori.\nMjss Aubrey bad not that winnjng grace wbioh gains the gaze and appIause of thc drawing-room assemblies. Thorc was none of that lighl brilliancy which only exists in theheated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of tbe mind heneclth. There wo\u017f a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate osoul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that 1ight footing, which stray\u017f where'er a butterfly or a colour may attraot\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his afscction, and would in her presence forget tho\u017fe griefs she knew dostraycd his rest, who wou1d have exchanged her smile for that of the volvptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then pIaying in the light of tbeir own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, aridhad not been presented t0 the wor ld, it hauing been thought by her guardians m0re fit lhat her presentalion should be delayed until her brother's relurn from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, thereforo, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the cpoch of her eritry irito the \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would ralher hove remained in the marision 0f his fathcrs, and fed upon the melancholy which averpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mirid had beeriso torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, wbicb had been annaunced as a drawing-raom.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had n0t been held for a long time, and all wha were anxious to bask in thc smilc of royalty, hastened lhither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, beedless of all around bim, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he hcld seen Lord Ruthven was in that uery place\u2014he felt himself suddenlysei2ed by the arm, and a voice he recognized too wel1, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remcmber your oath.\" He had hardly courage to lurn, fearful of seeing a spectre that wouId blast hiin, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which bad att-\nracted his notioe on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost rcfuslng to bear their weight, he waf obliged to take the arm af a friend, and f0rcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself jnto his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed hishands upon his heod, as if he wero afraid his thoughts were bursting from bis broin. Lord Ruthven again hefore him\u2014circumstanoes started up in dreadful array\u2014the dogger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himsels, he could not believe it pofsible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He lhought his imagination had coniured up the image his mirid was resting upon. It was impossible thol it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; far lhough ho attompted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his Iips, and he could not succeed in gaining jnsormation. He went a few nights after wltb his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protcction of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsolf up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering ariother room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; hc attempted lo pass clnd get neclr her, when one, whom he requesled to rnove, tumed round, and revealed lo him those features he most abhor red. He sprang forward, seizcd his sister's arm, and, wilh hurried stcp, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by tho crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard lhat voice whisper close to hirn\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare ta turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If befo re his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much morc completcly was it engrossed, now that the cortainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisler's attentions were now unheeded, and it was jn voin that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and tho se terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starlled him;\u2014was hethen lo allow this mon\u017fter to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all hc held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister inight havc been touchod by him. But even if he were to bre ak his oath, and disclose his \u017fuspicions, wh0 would believe him? He thought of cmploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had heen already mo cked. Far days he remoined in this state; sbut up in his raom, he saw no one, and ate only when his \u017fister came, who, with eye\u017f streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bcaring stillness arid solitude, he left his housc, roamed from street to streel, anxiou\u017f to f1y that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and hewandered, as often exposed to tbe noon-day sun as to the midnight damp\u017f. He was no Ionger to be recognized; al firsl he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid birn down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but lhey were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any\u2014srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea thclt he left by his absence the whole of his frionds, with cl fiend amorigst them, os whose presence they were unconscious, he deterrninod to enter agclin into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven opproached with intimacy. But when he entercd intoa room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to 6eg of him lo abstain from seekirig, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was beeoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume agclin thclt trust which had been before imposcd upon them by Aubrey's parenls.\nDesirous of saving bimfrom the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his waridorings, and of preventing him from oxposing to the general eye those marks of what thoy considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the hovse, and take conslant care of him. He bardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by 0ne terrible svbject. His incoberence became at last s0 great, that ho was confined to his chamber. Thero he would 0ften lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remainirigdisplayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then be wou1d sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that sevorely afflicted hor, he wovld desire her not lo touch bim. \"Oh, d0 not tovch him\u2014jf yourlove for me is clught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer wcls, \"Truc! true!\" arid again he sank into a state, whence not oven she could rouse him. This lclsted many month\u017f: gradually, however, as the year was pafsing, his jncoherences beoame less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion 0f its g1oom, whi1st his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, vpon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began ta conversewith bis physioian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's heing in so awfvl a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey'sattention was attracled;he a\u017fked anxiovsly to whom. Glad of this inark of returning intelIect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioried the riame of the Earl of Mclrsdon. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avbrey seemedpleased, and astonished them stil1 more by hisexprefsing his intonlion to be present at the nuptiols, and desiring to see his sister. They an\u017fwered not, but in a few minutes his si\u017fter wos with him. He was apparently agairi capable ofbeing clffectedby the inflvence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, fl0wing at the thoughl of her brother's being once inore alive to the feelings of affeotion. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulatc her upori hor marriage with a person so di\u017flinguished for rank and every accomplishment; wben he svddenIy perccived a locket upon her hreast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so l0ng insluenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he look od as if he did not understand ber\u2014then seizing ber hands, and gazing ori hcr with a frantic expressionof countenance, ho bade her swear lhat she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014itseemed as if that voice again bade him rcmember his oalh\u2014he turncd suddenly r0und, thinklng Lord Rutbven was near him but saw rio one. In the meanlimelhe guardians and physician, wbo had heard lhe whole, arid thought this was but a return of his dlsorder, eritered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He felI upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to dolay bul for ono day. Th ey, ottributing this ta the irisanity tbey imagined had taken possessjon of hif mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rulhven had called the rn0rning after tbe drawing-room, and had beon refused with every ono else. When he hcard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understaod himself to be the cause of it; but when he leclrned that he was deemed insane, hjs exultation and pleasure could bardly be conccaled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companian, and, by constant clttendance, and the prelence of great affection for the brother and inleresl in his fate, he gradually won thc ear of Mifs Aubrey. Who could resist hispower? His tongue had dangers and toi1s to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an lndividual having no sympathy with any being an the crowded earth, save with her to whom be addresfed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thal he might listen to hcr soathing aoconts;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the wiIl of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brarich falling at length to him, he 0btained an important embassy, whlch served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged stat-\ne,) whjch was to take placc the very day before hjs departure sor the continent.\nAubrey, when he wos left by the physician and his guardians, atlempted to bribe the scrvants, but in vain. He asked for pen and papcr; it was giveri him; he wrole a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, arid the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as thelr hope ond the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants pr0mised they would deliuer it; but glving it to the physician, he thought it betler not to haras\u017f any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considcred, the ravings of a moniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror lhat may rnore easily be eonceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Mornirig came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almosl frantic. The curiosity os the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the cust0dy of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a momerit found hlmself in the apartment where al1 were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first lo perceivehim: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Wberi on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in bis ear\u2014\"Rernember your oath, and know, if not my bride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So sclying, he pushed him towards his attendclnts, who, roused by the old womon, had carne in search of him. Aubrey could no Ionger \u017fupport hirnself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-ve\u017fsel, clnd he was conveyed to bed. Thjs was nol mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitatlng her. The marriage was solomnized, and lhe bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvbrey's weakness increasod; the effusion of bIood produced symptoms of the near appr0ach of death. He desired hjs sister's guardians might be called, and when the midriight hour had struck, he related oompofedly whclt the roader hos perused\u2014be died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey'f \u017fister had glutted the tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his ploce os rest, and Providence hi\u017f guidc.\"\nIN Sailing thraugh the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of hjs Majesty's vesseIs, iri lheyear 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the jsland of lhat naine. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply os cattle and vegetablcs always to be had there, induce many Brjtish uessels to uislt it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and thovgh it lies rather out osthe lrack for ships bound ta Smyrna, its bounties clmply repay for the deviatlon of a v0yage. We landed; as usual, at tho bottom of the bay,and whilsl the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with thc na tives, lhe cle rgyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other plaoes, where we had been hefore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an Englifh lord, who lefl the island four days prevlovs lo our arrival in his felucca. \"He engagod me as a pilot,\" said lhe Greek, \"and would havc taken me with him; but I did not ch0ose to quit Milylene, where I am likelyto get married. He was an odd, but cl very good man. The c0ttage over the hlll, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in cbargc 0f it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen manths, though not constantly; for he fail\u017f in his felucca very often to the different jslands.\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very much, and we l0st no time in hastening to the house where our countrymon had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the marision. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrancc hall, a drawlng-raom, a sltting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They wereall simp1y decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tahles onejlher side, a Iarge myrtle in the centre, anda small fountain beneath, wbichcould be made to play through the branehef by moving a \u017fpring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posturc; a large couch or sofa comp leted the fumjture. In the hal1 st0od half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single paintirig. The bedchamber had merely a large mattresf spread on the floor, with twa stuffed eotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marbIe recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whioh wore then in a large seaman's chesl in the closet: il was open, bul we did not thjnk ourselves justified in examinirig the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay V0ltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works compIete; Vo1ney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German langvage;Klopstook's Messiah; Kolzebue's noveIs; Schiller's play os the Robbors; Milton'\u017f Paradise L0st, an Italian edition, printed at Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, bul no English book of any description. Most of these b0oks were fiIled with marginal notes, wri tten with apencil, in Italiari and Lotin. The Messiah was Iiterally scribbled aIl over, and marked with sIips of paper, on which also werc remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading tbo\u017fe 6ooks the ovening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the othors; hul,\" sajd he, \"there they inust lie unlil his return; for he js so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did hirn a service; and I have the produce of thi\u017f farm for the trouble of taking care of jt, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeriian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reafon.\"\nThe appearclnce of tbe hovse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillors with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (cls jt is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey cclrpet, beneath an awning of strorig coarse linen. Mo\u017ft of the house-tops are thus fumished,as upori them the Greeks pass their everiings in smoking, drinking light winef, such as\"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlet glidod away, grapes, orangcs arid limes were clustoring togelher an its 6orders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back wa\u017f placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twolvo o'clock, readirig, writing, arid talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attonded ovr church twice o week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was whal may be tcrmcd \"a bird's-eye view.\" A lirie of rich vineyards led the eye to Movnt Calcla, cauered with olive and myrtle treef jn bloom, arid on the summit of which an anoient Greck teinple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins desoended in brokeri cascadcs, until it was l0st in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed by a single clovd, torminates lbe view in front; and a little on the1eft, lhrough a vista of lofty chefnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observe d, studding the light blue wave with spots of emeraId green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enqvirie\u017fwere fruitless as to the namc of the person who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And carinot yov tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\"We had not time to vifit the Armenicln, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of lhe isolated lord. He had portioned eight young gir1s when he was last upon the island, and even danced wilh them at the nuptial feast. He gaue a cow to one man, horses lo others, and cotton and silk to the girls who livc by weavjng these artjoles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman wbo had lost bis own in a gale, and be ofton gove Greek Testaments to the poor children. In fhort, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolenl character. One circumstance we learnt, which ovr old friend at the cottage th0ught proper not to disclose. He had a mast beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was oflon seen wa1king on the sea-shore, and he had bovght her a piano-forte, and taught her himself tbe use of il.\nSuch wasthe iriformation with which we departed from tbe peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guefsing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philonthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palerino, clll our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling jn Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him al Mitylerie.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years fram home; but \"Childe Harolde\"being put into our hands we recognizcd the rocluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regretnot having been more cvrious iri our researches ot the cotlclge, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene on some suture day; but to me that day wi1l never return. I make lhis stalement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justioe to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse t0 associating with humori riclture, or contrlbuting in any wcly ta sooth its sorrows, or add to its pIeasvres. The factis directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings 0f theheart, so elegaritly dcpicted in his lordship's poems, seem to hove their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charlty appear to gulde all his aetions: and his oourting thc repose of solitude is an additiorial reason formclrking him as a being on whose hearl Religion hath set her seal, and over whose heod Benevolence hath thrown bermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" with0ut feeling proud of him cls a countryman. With respect to bis Ioves or pleasures, I d0 not assume a rightto give an opiriion. Reports are ever to bo received with cautian, particular1y when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appe-\nar, alone may censurethe errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's charaeter is worthy of bis genius. To do good in secret, and shvn tho world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtu-\nous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","29":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Talo.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superftition upon which lhis tole is founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabians it appears to be coinmon: il did not, however, extend itself lo the Greeks untll ofter the e\u017ftahlishment of Christianity; and it has only assuined its present form sirice tbe division af tbe Lotin and Greek chu rches; at which time, the idoa becoming prevalenl, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their terr itory, it gradually increased, and formed the sub ject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful.In the West it spread, with \u017fome slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorrainc, where the belief exi\u017fted, thal vampyres nightly imblbed a cerlain portion of lhe blood of their victims, who bccame emaciated, lost tbeir strenglh, and speedily died of oonsvmptioris; wbilst these human blood-suekers fattened\u2014and their velns bccamo distended t0 such a state of rcpletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from lhe very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is slated to have occurred al Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an exomination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates os theplace, lhey positively and unaniinously afsirmed, that, about five year\u017f before, a certain Hoyduke, named Arnold Paul, bad been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers af the Turkish Servia,he had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a way to rid himself af the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grclve, clnd rubbing himself with bis blo0d. This precaution, hawever, did not preuent hiin srom becominga vampyre hlmself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, mariy persons comploined of having been tormented by hjin, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of 1ife by hi\u017f attacks. To prevent further mifchief, tho inhabitants having consvlted their Hadagni, took up the body, and sound it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and flarid blood. Proof having been thus obtalried, they resorled to the occustomed remedy. A stake waf driven entirely through the hoart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he hadbeen alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same rnea\u017fures were adoptod with tbe corses of th0se persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in thoir turn, become agents upon others who surviued them.\nThe univerfal belies is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and suck\u017f in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, beca use il seems better cldapted to lllu\u017ftrate the subject of the present obfervations than any other instaricc which couId be adduced. In many parts of Grecce it is considered as a sort of punishment aft er death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in exi\u017ftence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to corifine his infernal visitalions solely to those beirigs he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he wos bound by ties of kindred and affcction.\u2014A supposition alIuded lo in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eartb, as Vampyre sent, Thy cor\u017fe shall from its tomb be ront; Then ghastly haunt the native plclce, And suck the hlood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At mjdnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Mu\u017ft feed lhy livid livingcorse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall kriow the demon for their siro; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are wit heredon the ftem. Bvt one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved os all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap lhy hoart lri slame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's lasl spark, And the last glassy gIance must view Which freezes 0'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowod hand shal1 lear The tresses of her ye1l0w hoir, Of whicb, in life a l0ck when shorn Affectian's fondest pledge wasworn\u2014 Bul now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agoriy! Yel with thino own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rovc, Till these in h0rror shrink away From spectre more accursod than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also inlrodvced in his wild but beautiful p0em of \"Thalaba,\" the vclmpyre eorse 0s the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned from the grave for the pvrpose of tormenting him shc best 1oved whiIst in existence. But this cannot be supposed lo have resvlted fr0m the sinfvlncss of her life, she being p0urtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innoconce. The veracious Tourn-\nefort gives a lorig accourit in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whioh he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety 0f anecdotos, and traditionary riarratives illustrative of its effects, has put f0rth some learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on tbis singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explariation, arid which may now 6e concluded by merely romarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in rnost general acceptation, there are several 0thers synonymous with it, made vse of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened thot in the rnidst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appearcd at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, lhan his rank. He gazed up0n the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therejn. Apparently, the light laughter os the fair 0nly attracted his attention, that he mighl hy cl look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thought1efsness reigned. Those who felt this sensation 0s awe, could not exp1ain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the o bject's face, did not seem to pen-\netrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the iriward workings of the heart; but fell vpon the cheek wilh a leaden ray that weighcd upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities causcd him to be invited to every house; all wisbod to sec him, and those who hcld been accustomed to violont excjtement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their prosence capable af engagirig their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his sace, which never galned a warrner lint, ei ther from the blush 0f modesty, or from lhe strong emotion of passion, though its forrn arid outline were beautiful, mariy of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attenti0ns, and gain, al least, some mclrks of what they inight term clffection: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-r0oms since her marriage, threw herself in hls way, ond did all but put on tho dress os a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when sho stood before hlm, thavgh his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they wereunperceived;\u2014even her vnappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to hirn: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innacent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, h0weuer, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the drcad af his sirigular character, or tbat they were m0ved by his apporent hatred of vice, he was as often among those feinales who f0rm the boast of their sex fr0m thoir domestic vjrtues, as am0ng those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same tirne, there came to London a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he wcls an orphan lest with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, 6y parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himfelf by guardians, who thought it their duty mercly to take care of hjs fortune, whilc they relinqulshed the more important charge os his mind to the care of mer cenary su6cllterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, lbat high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' approntices. He believed all to sympathise witb virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in hy Provldence merely for tho picturesque esfect of the \u017fcene, as we see in romonces: he thought that the misery af a c0ttage mercly consisted in the vestlng of clothes, which were os warm, but which were better adapted to the pointcr's eye by tbeir irregulars0lds and various coloured patchef. He thought, in firie, that the dream\u017f of poels wero the realities of lifo. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for those reason s, upon bis entcring into the gay circ1o\u017f, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their lariguishing or rompjng favourites: the daughtersat the same timc, by their brightening countenanoes when he approacbed, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into folse notlons of his talents and his merjt. Attached as he was to the romance af his so1itary hours, he was \u017ftartled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the prefence of a ghost, but from want af snvffing, there was nofoundation in real life for any 0f thal congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in th0se volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, bowever, some compensation in his gratified vanity, be was about to relinquisb his dreoms, wberi the exlraordinary being we have above described, crossedhim iri his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observati0n of oxternal objects, than the tacit assent lo thcir existence, implied by the avoidonce of their coritact: allowing hif irnagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideaf, he s0on formed this object into the hero os o romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, ralher thon lhe person before him. Hc became acquainted wlth hirn, paid bim attentions, and so far advanced upon his notioe, that his presonce was always recognised. He gradvally Iearnt that Lord Ruthven's affajrs were ernbarrafsed, and soon found, from the notef of preparation in \u2014 Slreet, thal he wo\u017f about to travel. Desirous af gaining some infarmation respecting this singvIar character, who, till now, had on1y whetted bis curiosity, he hlnted to his guardians, that it wa\u017f time for him lo porform the lour, which for many generation\u017f has 6een thought riecessary to enable the young to take some ropid steps in the eareer of vice towards putting themseIves upon clnoquality with the aged, and not allowing tbem to appeclr as if fa1len from the skie\u017f, whenever scandolous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn in carrying thom on. They eonsented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning his intenlions to Lord Rulhven, waf surprised to receive from him a propasal to join him. Flattered by such a rnark as estecm fram him, who, clpparently, had nothirig in comrnon with athcr men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few dayf they had passed the eircling waters.\nHithert0, Aub rey had had no opportunity of studying L0rd Ru lhvcn's charactor, and nowhe found, thot, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his eoriducl. His companion was prosuse in his li6erality;\u2014the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more tban enough to relieve their iminediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upori the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the missortunes attendanl euen vpon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014lbese were serit from tbe door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prosligate came to ask sometbing, not to relieue his wants, but toallow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him stil1 doep cr in his iniquity, ho was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the viciou\u017f, whlch gcneral1y prcvalls over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one cjrcum\u017ftance about the charity af bis Lardship, which was still morc impressed upon his mind: oll tho\u017fe upon whom lt was bestowed, inevitably fovnd tbat there waf a curse upon it, for they were alI either led to the \u017fcaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns through whicb they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparcnl eagerness wilh whlch his eomponion sought for the contres of oll fashionable vice; there he entered into all tbe spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, cxcept where the known sharper was his aritogonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it wcls always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he oncountered the rashyouthful novice, or the luckless sather of a nurnerous family; then his vory wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was lajd aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the ha1f-dead mouse. In every towri, he 1eft the formerly affluent youth, torn srom the circle headorned, cur\u017fing, iri lhe solitude of a dungeon, the fate that haddrawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat sranllc, amidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to bvy even suffioient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no m0ney from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of rnany, the last gildor he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but he the result of a certaln degree of knowledge, whjch was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that cbarity and pleasure which proued the ruin of all, clnd did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for eoch day he hoped his friend would give him s0me opportunity of spoak-\ning frankly and openly to him; however, this neuer occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: hi\u017f eye spoke lefs than his lip; arid though Aubrey was near the objectof his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratificatian from it than the constant excitement of vainly wisbing to break that mystery, which to hls exalted imaginalion began to assuine the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon clrrived at Romo, and Aubrey fora time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whjlst he went in search of the momorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst he was thus erigaged, letters arrived from England, whjcb he opened with eager impaticnce; the first was from hjs sister, breathing nothing but affcclion; the others werc from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if il had before enlered inta hif imagination that there was an evil power residcnt in his companjori, these feomed ta give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians irisisted upon his immediatcly lea-\nvirig his friend, and urged, that his eharacter was dreadfully vicious, for lhat the possession os irr esistible powers of seduction, rendered his Iicentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, lhat his contempt for the adullress had not originated in batred of her character; but lhat he had required, to enhance his gratificatiori, thot his victim, thepartner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacIe of unsullied virtue, down to tbe 1owest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those fema1es whom be had sought, apparentIy on aecount of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside,and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their viccs to the public gaze.\nAubrey determlned upon leaving one, who se character had riot yet shown a single bright point an whieh to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him a1together, purpofing, in the mean while, to watch him more clofcly, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon theinexperience of the daughter of the lody whofe hovse he chiefly frequcnted. In Ita1y, it is seldom that an unmarried fema1e is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on bjs plclns iri secret; but Aubrey's eye followed hiin in all his windings, and soon discovered that ari assignation had been clppointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. L0sing no lime, he entered tho apartment of Lord Ruthveri, and abruptly asked bim his intentions with respect lo the lady,lnformlng him at the same tlme that he was aw are of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that bis intentions were such as he supposcd all wouId have upon such an occasian; and upon being pressed whether he jntended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retircd; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordshlp in the remainderof their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the molher of the lody, jnformed her of all he knew, not only wjth regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. Tbe assignation was preuerited. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his completc assent to a soparation; 6ut did not hjnt any suspicion of his planf havirig been foiled by Aubrey's jnterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing tbe Peninsula, saon sound himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monurnents that apparently, ashamed of ehronicling the deed\u017f 0f freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she mjght have formed the modcl for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope os the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save tbat her eyes \u017fpoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pIain, or trippod along the mountain'\u017f side, one wovld have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beaulies; for who would have exchangod her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for lhatsleepy luxurious look of theanjmal suited but to lho taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his fearch after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious girI, engaged in the pursuit 0f a Kashmere butterfly, sbow the whole beauly of her f0rm, floating as it wore upon the wind, to lhe eager gclze of him, who forgot the letters he had jvst decyphered upon an cllmosl effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her \u017fylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in tbe sun's ray such delioalely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, il might well excuse lhe forgetfulness of the anliquary, who let escape from hjs mjnd the very object he had before thoughtof vital importarice to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousania\u017f. But why attempt to describe charms which all fcel, hut none can appreciate?\u2014It was innoeence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling halls. Whilft hedrew those remains af which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch themagic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes af her native place; she wou1d then describe to him the cireling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the gIowing colours of youthfu1 mernory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infoncy; and then, turnirig to subjects thclt bad evideritly made a greater impression upon her mlnd, would tell himall the supernatural tales of her nvrse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled thc irilerest eueri of Aubrey; and often af she told hjm the tale of lhe living varnpyre, who had passed years amidst hls friends, and dearest tios, forced every yeclr, by feeding upan the life of a lovely female to prolong his existerice for the ensuing manths, his bloodwould run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe ciled to him tbe naines of old men, who had at last dctected one living among themselves, after several of their nearrelatives arid children had been found marked with the stamp of the fjend's appetite; and when she sound him so incredulovs, she begged of him to believe her, sor it had been, remarked, that thosc who hod dared to questiori their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, witb gries and heartbreaklng, to confess it was true. Sbe detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his borror was increased, by hearing a prelty accurate deseription of Lord Rutbven; he, however, ftill persisled jri porsuading her, that therc could be no truth in her fears, thougb at the same time he wondered clt lhe many coincidences which had all tended to oxcite cl bclief intho supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to attach himsc1f more and more to Ianthe; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he hod sought for his vision of romonce, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself more and more attachcd to the almost fairy forin before him. He would tear himself at times from her, arid, forming a plan for some antiqvarian researcb, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attalned; but he always found it impofsible to fix his attentiori upon the ruiris around bim, whilst in his mjnd he retained an image thot seemed alorie the righlful posses\u017for of his th0ughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the saine frank infantilc being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it waf because she had no longer any one with whom she could uisit ber favourite hclunts, whilst her guardian was occupjod ln sketching or uricovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealod to her parents ori the subject of Vampyres, ond they both, with several preserit,offirmed their ex isterice, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determjned to proceed upon one af his excursians, which was to detain him for a few hours; whon they heard the name of tbe place, they all at once begged of him riot ta rcturn at night, as he must necessarily pass througha wood, where no Greek w0uld ever remaln, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They de\u017fcribed it as the resort of the vampy res in their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared lo cross their path. Aubrey made light of thelr representatioris, and tried to 1augh them out of theidea; but when he saw thein shudder at hi\u017f daring thvs to mock a svperior, infernal powcr, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey sel off upon his excursion vnattended;he was surprised to o6serve the melancholy face of hi\u017fhost, and was concerned tofind thal hiswords, mocking the bclief of those horriblc flends, had inspired them wjth such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to theside of his bor\u017fe, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beirigs to be put in actlon;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupiod in his research, thal he did not perceive that day-Iight would soori end, and that in the horlzon there was one of thase specks which, in the warmer cljmates, so rapidly gother into a tremondous mass, and pour a1l their rage upon tbe devoted c0untry.\u2014He at last, however, inounted hi\u017f horse, determiried lo moke up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climat-\nes, is almost vnknown; immediate1y the sun setf, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, tbe power of tbe st0rm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemcd to fall clrid radiale at his very feet. Sudderily his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadfvl rapidity through the entangled forest. The ariimal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he wcls in the neighbourhaod of a hovel that hard1y lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, be approached, hoping to find soine one to guide him to tbe town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pellirig of the storm. As he approacbed, the thunders, for a inoment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadfvl shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued ln ane almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effa rt, sorced open the door of the hut. He found himself in uttcr darkness: the sound, hawever, guided hlm. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, s till the sounds contjnued, ond rio riotice wastaken of him. He found hlmself in coritoct with some orie, whom he immediately soized; when a voice cried, \"Again basfled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted from his feet and hurl ed with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and krieeling upon his brcast, had placed his harids upan his throat\u2014wherithe glare of mariy torches penetraling through the h0le that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014be instantly r ose, and, leavjng his prey, rushed through the door, and in a momerit the crashing of the branchcs, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those withaut. They entered; the light of tbeir torches fell vpon the mud walls, arid tbe thatch laaded on every individual straw with heavy flakos of saot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was ogairi lest in darkness; but what was his harror, when the ligbt of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifelcss corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that il was but a vision arising from his disturbed imaginatlon; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. Thcre was no colour upon hor cheek, not even upon her lip; yet thero was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt lhere:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and vp0n her throclt were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneous1y struok with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litler was qvlckly formed, clnd Aubroy was laid by the side of hcr who hcld lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now falleri with the flawer of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and soemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciovsIy in his hand a naked dagger of a pclrticular conslruction, whjch had been fourid in the hut. They were soon met by different parties wbo had been engclged in lhe search of her whom a rnother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, fareworned the parents of some drcadful cataslrophe. \u2014To describe thcir gricf would be iinpossible; but when tbey ascertalned the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both djed br0kcn-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and wclf often delirious; in these intervals he wouId call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthc\u2014by s0rne unaccouritabIe combination he seemed to beg of his formor companion to spare the being he loved. At olher times he would imprecate maledietions upon his head, and curse him as her destroycr. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever motive, upon hoaring of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in thesame house, and became his constant attendanl. Wben the latter recovered from his delirium, he was h0rrified ond start1ed at the sight of him whose image he hod now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implyirigaImost repentance for the fault thclt had caused their scparation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to bis presenco. Hi\u017f lordship seemed quite chariged; he no Ionger appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the faine state of mind, and Aubrey perceivcd no difference from the former man, excepl that at timos he was surpri\u017fed to meet hjs ga2e fixed intently upori hlm, with a smile of malicious exultatiori playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smjle haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid 's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apporently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by lhe cooling brceze, or in marking the progre\u017fs of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elosticity of spirit which had once so djstinguished him now seemed to have fIed for ever. He wa\u017f now as inuch a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in tho neighbourhood of Atbons; if he sought it amidst the ruins he hod formerly frequentcd, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in tho w0ods, her 1ighl stcp would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, wouId show, to his wild imagination, her paIo foee and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feclture of which created such bitter a\u017fsociatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom he held himself bourid by the tonder care he bad taken of him during his iIlness, that lhey should ui\u017fit those parts of Groece neither had yet seen. They trovelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but thovgh they thus bastened from pIace to place, yet they seemed riot to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they graducllly began to slight these reports, which tbey imaginod were orily the irivention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of thofe whom they defended from pretended dangerf. In conseqvence of thus neglecting the advice 0f the jnhabitanls, on one occclsion they travelled with only a few guards, moro lo serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at lhe bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the nelghbouring precipices, tbey had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in lhe narrow pass, when theywore starlled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of sevcrol guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, p1acing tbemselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction wbence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a momcnt behind the shelterlng turn of the defile: but ashamed os being thu\u017f detained by a foe, who with insuIting shouts bade tbem advance, arid heing exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb obove and take thcm in the rear, they determined clt once to rush forward in scarch of the enerny. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthveri received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his afsistance; and, no l0nger heeding the conlest or his own peril, was soon su rprised by secing the robbers' saces around him\u2014hjs guards havlng, up0n Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promi\u017fes of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend lo a neigh6ouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbcd by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the cntrance till their c0mradc should roturn with the promised sum, for which he had an ordor. Lord Ruthven's strength ropidly decreased; in two days mortification ensucd, and death seemed advancing with hasty sleps. His condu cl and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards tho closo of lhe last evening, his mind became appareritly uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, wha was jnduced to offcr hls assistance with more than usual eamestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may savc me\u2014you may da more tban that\u2014I mecln not my life, I heed the death of my exislorice as ljttle as that of tbe possing day; but you may save my honour, y0ur friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I w0uld do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but ljttle\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannol explain the whole\u2014but if you would conoeal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in tho world's mouth\u2014ond if my doath were unknown for some time in Eriglclnd\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall nat be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried thedying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear hy all your soul reueres, by all y0ur naturo fears, swear that, for a year and a day y0u will not impart your knowledge os my crimes or deoth to any living being in ariy way, whatever inay happen, or whatcver you inay see.\"\u2014His eyes seemed bvrfting from thcir sockots: \"I \u017fwear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many eircumstancef attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiuering came over him, as if from the prefentirnenl of s omething horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he wos about to enter the boveI iri whicb he had left the corpse, when arobber met him, arid i nformed him that it was no longer thcre, bavjng been conveyed by him\u017felf and comrades, upon hjs retjring, to tbe pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according lo a promise thcy had given his lordship, tbat it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astoni\u017fhed, and laking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, wbon he had mounted to the suminit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, thoughtho robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they hod laid tbe body. For a tirne bis mind was bewildered ln c0njectures, but he at last retvrned, convinced that they had buried the corpse sor the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a courilry in which he had met with such torrjble misf0rtunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized up0n his mind, he resolued to leave it, and soon arrivcd at Smyrna.While waiting sor cl vossel to c0nvey him ta Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging t hose effects he had wilh him bclonging to Lard Ruthven. Amongst other thirigs therewas a case containing several weaporis of offence, more or less odapted to ensure thc death of lhe victim. There were several daggcrs and ataghan\u017f. Whllst turning lhem over, and examining their curious forms, whal was his surprise at finding a shoathapparently 0rnamented in the sclme style as the dagger djscovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gajn surther proof, he faund tbe weapon, clnd his horror may be imagined when he diseovered that it fjtted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing tobe bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; bul the particular form, the saine varying tints upon the haft and shealh werc alike in spleridaur on both, and left no rooin for doubt; there were cllso drops of bloodon each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, hisfirst inquiries were concerning the lady be had attempted to snatch from Lord Rulhven's seductive arts. Her parents wero in distress, thoir fortuno ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deparlure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeotcd borrors; he was afraid tbat this lady had falleri a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became inorose and silent; arid his only occupalion con\u017fisted invrging the speed of the postilions, as if he were goirig to save the life of some one he he1d dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shorcs; and he hastened to the manslan of his fatbers, arid there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ernbracesand caresses of his sisler, all memory of the past. If she before, by ber infantine caresses, had gained bis affcction, now that the waman began lo appear, she was slill more attaching as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey had not that wjnning grace which gains the gaze and applaufe of the drawirig-room assemblies. There was none of that lighthrilliancy which on1y exists in the heated almosphere 0f a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never ljt up by the leujty of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy cbarm about it which did not seem to arise from misfartune, bvt froin s0mefeeling within, thal appeared ta indicate o sovl conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was nat that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may clttract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. Wben ol0ne, her face was riever brightened by the smile of j0y; but when her brother breathed t0 hcr his affection, and would in her presence forget those grlefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged hor smile for that of the v olupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing inlhe light of thejr own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians mare fit tbat her presentcltion should be delayed until her hrother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fclst approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey wouIdrather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy wbich overpowered him. He could not feel intereft about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mjnd hod been so torn by the eventf he had witnes\u017fed; but he determiried to \u017facrifice his own comfort to the pratection af his sister. They soon arrived in lown, and prep ared for tbe next day, which had been anriovnced as a drawing-r0om.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had riot been held for a long timo, and aIl who were anxious to bask jn the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aub rey was there with his sister. While he was slariding in a corner by himseIf, heedless of all around him, engaged iri the remembrance lhat the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that very place\u2014hefell himseIfsuddenly seized by the arm,and a voice he recogni2ed too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly cour-\nage to tvrn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, wheri he pcrccived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attraeted his notice on this spot vpon his first entry into soeiety. He gazed till his limbs almost rcfusing lo bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcinga passage through the crowd, he threw h imself into bjs carriage, and was driveri home. He paced tbe room with hurried steps, and fixed bis hands upon hls head, as if he were afraid his thought\u017f were bursling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again beforehim\u2014circumstances started up in dreadfvl arroy\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, be cou ld not belieue it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determlned, therefore, to go aga in into society; for though he atlempted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succced in gaining information. He went a few riights after with his sister to tbe assembly of a near relation. Leaving her vnder the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were 1eaving, he roused hirnself, and entering another room, found his sister svrroundedby several, apporently in carnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requosted lo rnove,turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, sei2ed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by tbecrowd osservants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erigaged in passing them, hc again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did nol dare to turn, but, hurrying hif sjster, soon rcaohed home.\nAubrey hecame almost dislracted. If before his mind had been a6sorbed 6y one subjeot, how much more compl-\netcly was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pre\u017fsed upon bls thovghts. His sisler's attentions were now unheeded, and it wa\u017f in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what hod eaused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and lhose terrified her. The inore he tbought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to cl1low this monster to roam, bearing ruin upori his breath, amidst all he held declr, and not avort its pr0gress? His very sister might have been louched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thoughtof employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remombered, had been already mockcd. For days he remained in thls state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wha, witb eyes streamjng with tears, besought hlm, for her sake, to support nature. At lost, no Ionger capablc of beclring stillnefs and solitude, he left his hou\u017fe, roamed from ftreet to street, anxious to fly thal image which haunted him. His dress became ncglected, and he wandercd, as often exposed to lhe noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to tho h0use; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxjous for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuerswiftor thari any\u2014from thovght. His conduct, however, svddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he loft by his absenoe the whole of his friends, with a fierid amongst them, of wbose presence they were unconscious, he determjned to cnler again into sociely, and watch him closcly, anxjous to forewarn, in spite of his oath, al1 whom Lord Ruthuen approached with intimacy. But wben he entered into a room, his haggard and \u017fuspicious looks were so strikjng, his inward shudderings so uisible, lhal his sister was clt last ob1iged to beg of him lo abslain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, howevor, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to jnterpose, and, fearing that his mind was becomjng alienatcd, they thoughl it hjgh time to refume again that trust which had heen before imposcd upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirovs of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dajly encountered in his wclriderings, and of preventing him from exposing to tbe general eye those mclrks af what they corisidered folly, they engaged a physician t0 reside in the house, and take constant oare of him. He hardly appeared lo notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence beoame clt last so great, that he was confined to his chambcr. There he would often 1ie for days, incclpable ofbeing raused.He had become emaciated, his eyes hod attained a glassy lustre;\u2014lbe only sign of affection andrecollection remainjng di\u017fplayed itsels upon the entry of his si\u017fter; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would defire her not to touch him. \"Oh, d0 not tovch him\u2014if your love far me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only ariswer wos, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted mony months: gradualIy, howevor, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw osf a portion of its gl0om, whilst his guardians observed, that several tirnes in the day he wovld counl upori his fingers a definite numbcr, and lhen smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one os hls guardians entering his room, beg an to converse wilh bis physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situatiori, when his sister was g0ing next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he a\u017fked anx-\niously to whom. Glad af this mark as returning inlellect, of whlch they seared behad 6een deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl os Marsden. Thinking thls was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonishcd them still more by his express ing his intontion to be pre-\nsent at the nuptials, arid desjring to see hls sister. They answered not, but in a few mlnutes his sister was with him. He was clpparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breasl, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and euery accomplishment; when be suddenly pereeived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise al beholding the features os the monster wh0 had so longinfluenced his life. Hesei2ed the portrait in a paroxysm of rclge, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking hiin why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he laoked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hclnds, and gazing on her with a frantlc expressi0n of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this rnonster, far be\u2014 But he could not advclnce\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him rem ember hls o ath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime tho guardiclns arid physician, who had heard the whale, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired ber to leavc him. He fell upon his knees ta them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day.They, attrjbuting lhis to the in\u017fanity they imagined hod taken possess-\nion of his mind, cndeauoured to pclcify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refvsod with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to he the cause of it; but wheri he learned that he was deemed infane, his exvltation and pleasure could hardly be eoncealed from those among whom he hcld gairied this information. He hastened to lhe hovse of his former companion, and, by constant atlendance, and the pretence os great affection for the brolher and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toi1s to recaunl\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save withher t0 whom he addressed himself;\u2014could teIl how, sincc he knew her, his existence, bad begun lo seem worthy ofpreservation, if it were merely that he might ljsten to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serp ent's clrt, or \u017fuch was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to hjm, he oblalned an importarit embassy, which servcd as an excuse sor ha stening the marriage, (in spite of her hrother's deranged state,) which was to takeplace the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAuhrey, when he was left by the pbysician and his guardions, attempted to bribe thc servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wroto a lettor to his slster, corijuring ber, as fhe valuod her own happiriess, ber own honour, and thc honour of those now in thc grave, who once held hcr in their arms a\u017f their hope arid tho hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marrjage, on which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promlsed thcy would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he tbought it better not to harass any more lhe mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he oorifidercd, the ravings of a mariiac. Night p assed on without rest to the busy inrnate\u017f of the houso; clnd Aubrey heard, with a horror thot may more easily be conceived thari de\u017fcribcd, the notes of busy preparatian. Mornjng came, and the sound of carrlages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almosl frantic. The ouriosity of the servants at last overcarne lheir vigilance, they graduaIly stole away, leaving hiin in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in o moment found hjm\u017felf in the apartmont where all wero nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive bim: bc immediately approaohed, and, taking hls arm by force, hurried hiin from the room, speechless with rage. Wben on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dj\u017fhorioured. Wornen are frail!\" So saying, he pvshed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Au6rey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had braken a blood-vessel, and he wos conveyed to bed. This was not rnentioned to his sister, whowaf not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and hridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness incroased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He deslred his sister's guardians might be called, and wheri tbe midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has peruscd\u2014he died immediately afler.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; bul wben they arrived, it wcls too 1ale. L0rd Ruthven had disappcared, and Au6rey's sister had glutted tbe thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT DF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was clll bef0re him, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on boord one of his Majesty's vessels, jn theyear 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that nclme. The beauty of this place, and thc cerlain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, indvce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay sorthe deviation of a voyage. Wo landed; as usual, at the boltom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in watering, and tbe purser bargaining for cattlo with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave cal1ed Homer's School, and othcr places, where we had heen before. On the brow of Mouril Ida (a small monticulo so named) we met with and erigaged a young Grcek as our guide, who told us he had come frorn Scio with an Englifh lord, who left the lsland four day\u017f previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" faid lhe Greek, \"and would have takeri me with him; but I did not choose lo quit Mjtylene, whereI am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and hc has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, tbe wine-trader, six hundred zechines for il, (about L25o Englisb currency,) and has rcsided thore aboul fourteeri months, though nol constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nTbis account excited our ouriosity very much, and we lost no time ln hastening t0 the house where our c0untryman bad resided. We were kindly received by an old inon, whoconducted us over the mansi0n. It consistedof four apartmcnts on the grourid-floor\u2014an eritrarice hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spocious closet annexed. They wero all simply decoroted: plain green-stainod wal1s, marble tabIes on either side, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a smallfountain beneath, which could be made ta play through the brariches by moving a spring sixed in the side of a small bro nze Venus in a leanirig posturo; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bo0k-cose: there were rio mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stussed cotton quilts and a piIlow\u2014the common bed throughout Greeeo. In the slttirig-room we observed a marble recess, f0rmerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papcrs, which were then in a lclrge seaman'f chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselve\u017f justified in examiriing the cantents. On lbo tablet of the recess lay Vo ltclire's, Shakspeare's, Boileav's, and Rousscau's works complete; Volney's R uins of Empires; Zimmerman, in tho German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue'\u017f novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mjllon's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, pririted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press clt Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, writlcn wlth a pencil, in Italiari and Latin.The Messiah was literally scribbIed all over, and marked with slipf of paper, on which cllso were remark\u017f.\nThe old man said:\"The 1ord had been reading these books lbe evening before be sai1ed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they mustlie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to movo onc thirig without orders, he would frown upon me sor a week togeth er; he is otherways very good. I once did hirn a service; and I haue the produoe of this farm for the trouhle of lakjngcare of it, except twenty zcchines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage iri the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianop1e; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appcarance of the house extemally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty poces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and frot-work corriices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wcls c0vered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus surnished, as upon thcm the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines,such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evcning breeze.\nOn the left hand as we enlered the hovse, a small streamlet glidod oway, grapes, orange\u017f and limes were clustering t0gether on jls borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle 6ushes, o marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we wero told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old mari, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always clttended ovr church twice a week, be\u017fides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may bc termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich viricyards led the eye to M0unt Calcla, covered with alive and myrtlc trees in bloom, and on the svmmit of which an ancierit Greek templeappeared in inajeftic decay. A small stream issuing from lhe ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the m0untain 's bose. Tho sea smooth as glass, ond an horizon unsbadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the lefl, through a vista of lofly ehesnvt and palm-trees, several smclll islands were distinctIy observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldam enjoyed a uiew more than I did tbis; but our enqujries were fruitless as to the name of the persori who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew hjs naine but Dominick, his banker,who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" sclid our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannotyou tel1, old frlend?\" faid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said ho, \"I dare not.\" We had riot time to vl\u017fit the Armenian, but on our return t0 the town we learnt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioried eight yaung girls when he was la\u017ft upon the island, and even dariced with them at lbe nuptial feast. Hc gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weavirig theso articles. He also bought a new boal for a fisherman wha bad lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testclmonts to the po0r children. In short, he appeared ta us, from all we col1eoted, to have been a very eccentric and honevolent cbaracter. One circumstance we lcarnl, whicb our old friend at the cottage thought proper not todisclase. He hada most bcautifu1 daughter, with whom the Iord was often seen walkjng on the sea-shore, and he had bought ber a piano-forte, and taughther himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peacefvl isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guossing who this rarnbler in Greece could be. He had money it was eviderit: he had philanthropy of di\u017fposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued ot Palermo, a1l our doubts were dispelled.Falling in campany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S,who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeec, \"The indjvidual,\" sclid he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travelf on the jsland of Tenedos, and I al\u017fo visited him at Milylene.\" We had riever then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret n0t baving been more curious ln our researches at tho cottage, but we oonsoled ourse1ves with the idea of returnirig to Mitylene on some future day; but to ine that day will neuer return. I make this statement, believing il not quile uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, whioh has been grossly slandered. He has been defcribed as of an urifeoling disposition, overse to assooiating with humari noture, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The foct is diroctly the roverse, as may be plairily gathered from these 1lttle anecdolos. All lhe finer feelings 0f tho heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have tbeir seat in his hosom. T enderness, \u017fympathy, and eharity appear to guide a1l hjs actions: and his courting the repase of folitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on wbose heart Religion halh set her seal, and over whose head Benevalencc hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the prcceding pleasing \"traits\" wlthout feeling proud 0f him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assurne a righl to gjvo an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularIy when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dclres iustify himsclf before lhat awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may cenfvre the err0rs of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's chclracter is worthy of his genius. To do good in secrot, and shun the world's applause, is the \u017furest testimony of a virtuous heart and sels-approving conscjence.\nTHE END\nGillct, Printer, Crown-c0url, Fleet-street.","30":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon whieh this lclle is founded if very gcneral in the East. Among thc Arabians it appears to bc comman: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until afler the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form sjnce the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at wblch time, the idea becoming prcualent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if bvried in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfvlstories, still extant, of the dead rising from lheir graves, and feedingupon the blood of the young and beauliful. In the West it spread, witb s0me slight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where lhe belief existed, tbat vampyres nightly irnbibed a certain portion of the blood of thoir victirns, who became emaciated, lost tbeir strength, and speedily died of consvmptions; whilst these human bIood-suckers fattened\u2014and theirveinf became distended to such a state of repletion, os to causo the blood to flow from clll the pasfages of lheir bodies, and even from the very pores 0f their skins.\nIn the London Jourrial, of March, 173z, is a curious, and, of caurse, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifm, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungory. It appears, that upon an examinatian of the commander-in-chief clnd magistratos of the place, they posilively and unanimously offirmed, that, about five year\u017f before, a cerlain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been lormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself wjth his 6lood. This preeaution, however, did not prevcnt him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of having been tormented by him, ond cl deposition was mado, lbat four personf had beeri deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the irihabitants having consulted theirHadagni, took up tbe body, and sound it (as is supposcd to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresb, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting al the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they rosorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entireIy through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at whlchhe is reported to hove eried out as dreodfully as if he had been alive. This dorie, they cut aff his head, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his groue. The same measures were adopted wilhthe corses of those persons who hod previously died from vampyrism, lest lhey should, in thelr turri, become agents up0n others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vclrnpyrehimself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relaled, because il seeins better adapted to lllustrate thesubject of the pre\u017fenl observations than any other instance whlch c0uld be adduced. In many parl\u017f of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after deatb, for some heinous orime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only daomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine his infernal visitotions solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred ond affection.\u2014A suppositlon olluded t0 in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre fent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Thenghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all tby roce; Tbere from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy Iivid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demori for their sire; As cursing thee, lhoucvrsing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngesl, best 6eloved of all, Shall ble\u017fs thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap tby heart in slame! Yel thov inust end thy task and mark Her cheek'\u017f last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the lost glassy glance must viow Which freeze\u017f o'er ils lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shaIl tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when \u017fhorn Affection's fondest plcdge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thce Memoricll of thine agony! Yet wilh thine own best blood \u017fhall drip; Thy gnashirig tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to tby sullen grave, Go\u2014and wjth Gouls and Asrits rave, Till thcse in borror shrink awcly From spectre more aocvrsed than they.\nMr. Southey baf also introduced in his wild but beauliful poem of \"Tbalclba,\" the vampyre c0rse of the Arobian maid Onoiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpase of tormenting himshe best loved whilst in existence. But this cari riot be supposed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed throughout the whole of the tole as a complete type of purlty and innocence. The uerclclous Tournefort gives a long aceount in his travels of \u017feveral astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have becn ari eyewitness; and Calmet, in bis great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives ilIustrative of its esfects, bas put fortb some learned dissertations, tonding to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMclny curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and whioh rnay riow be concluded 6y merely remclrking, that though the lerm Vampyre is the onein most general acceplation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various ports of the warld: as Vroucol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblernan, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He g azed upori the mirth ar ound him, as if he could not participate thereiri. Apparently, the light lavghter of the faironly atlracted his attention, that he might by a lo0k quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thougbtlessne\u017fs reigned. Those who felt this sensatian of awe, could not explain wherice it arose: some attributed it to tho dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's foce, did not seem to penetrote, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek witb a leaden ray that weighed upon the fkin it could not pass. His peculiaritics caused hiin to be invited to every house; all wished to see him,and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinenl, clnd now fe1t the weight of ennui, wore plea\u017fed at havirig something in thoir presenee capable of engaging their attenti on. In spiteof the dead1y hue of hls face, which never gained a warmer ti nt, either from the blush of m0desty, or srom tho strong emotion of pas\u017fion, thougb its form and oullinc were beautlfu1, many of the female hunters ofter notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, al least, some marks of what they migbt term affection: Lody Mercer, who bad beenthe rnockery of every m0nster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, arid did all but pvt on the dress of cl mountebonk, to attract his notice:\u2014lhough in vain:\u2014when she slood before him, though his eycf were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was basfled, and she loft the field. But though the common adultrcss could not influence everi the guidance of his eyes, itwas not that the semale sex was indifferent lo him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to lhe virtuous wife and irinocent daughter, thclt few knew he ever addresscd himself t0 fcmales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whethcr it wcls that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were inoved by his clpparenl hatred of vice, he was as often ainong those females wbo form the boast of their sex from their dome-\nstic virtues, as among those who sully it by tboir vlces.\nA6ovt the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of tbe name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the p0ssession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in ehildhood. Left also to hjrnself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they reIinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltorn\u017f, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, thot high romontic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' clpprentlces. He believed a1l to sympathise with virtuo, and tbought that uicc waf thrown in by Providence merely for tbe picturesque effeot of the scene, as wc see in romances: he thought that the mifery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of elothes, which were as worm, but which were better adapted to the painler's eye by their irregulclr folds andvarious coloured patcbes. He thought, in fine, that the dreamf of poets were the realities of life. Ho was handsome, srank, and rich: for these rea\u017fans, upon his entering into the gay cjrcles, many rnothers furrounded him, strivlng whjch should describe with least truth their languifhing or romping savouriles: the daughterf at the same time, by tbeir brightening counteriarices when hc approached, and 6y thoir sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him inta false nolions of his talents and his morit. Attached as hc was to the romance of his solitary hours, he wos st artled at finding, thot, except in the tallow and wax candles that sllckered, nat from the presenceof a ghost, but srom want of snufflng, thcre was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasirig pictures and descriptions contained in lhose v0lumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified variity, he was abovt to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary heing we hove above desoribed, orossed him in hjs career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossi6ility of forming an idea of the cbclracter of a man entiroly absorbed in himse1f, who gave few othcr sigris of his obsorvation of external object\u017f, than the tacit assent to tbeir existence, implied by tbe auojdance of their contact: allowing his iinogination to picture e very tbing that flattered lts propensity toexlravagant ideas, he soan formed this object into tho hero af a rornance, and determined to observe the osfspring of his fancy, rather lhan the person before him. He became acquainted wjth him, pald him attentions, and so far advancedupon his notice, that bis presence was always recognised. He gradually leclrnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, frorn the notes of preparcltion in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gainirig some informatiori respecling this singular charactcr, who, lill now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for bim to perform the tour, which for mariy generations bas 6een thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid fteps in the careor of vice lowards putling themselves up0n an equality with the aged, and riot a1lowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, wheneuor scondalous intrigues are menlioned as the subjects as pleasclntry or of prai\u017fe, according lo the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentloriing his intentions to Lord Rvthven, was surprised toreceive from him a proposol to join him. Flattered by such cl mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with othor men, he gladly accepled it, and in a few days thcy had passed the circling waters.\nHlthcrlo, Aubrey had had no apportvnity of studylng Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the rcsults offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to bis conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idlc, the vagobond, and the beggor, reoeived from bis hand more lhan enougb ta relieve their immediate wants. Bul Aubrey could not avoid remarking, thot it was riot upon tbe uirtuous, reduced to jndigence by themissorlunes atlendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when theprofligate came to ask something, notto rolieue his wants, bul to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniqujty, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attribuled by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which gerierally provails over the retiring bashsu1ness os the virtuous indigent. Tberc wos ane circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, whjch was \u017ftill more impressed upon his mind: al1 those upan whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for tbey were all either led to the scaffold, orsvnk to the lowest and the most abiect misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed,Aubrey was surprized at the apparenleagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of thc faro table: he betted, and always gambled with suocess, except where the known sharper waf his antagonist, and then he losl even more than he gajned; but it was always with thc samo vnchanging face, witbwhich he generally wotched the society around: it was riot, however, so when he encovntered the rash youthfu1 nouice, or tho luckless father of a numerous fami1y; theri his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent clbstractedness of mind was 1aid aside, and his eyes sparklod with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, heleft tbe formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the folitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him withiri the reach of this fiond; whilst many a father sat frantic, amid\u017ft the speaking looks of mvte hungry chlldren, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to sat-\nisfy their present crav ing. Yel he look no money from tbe gambling table; but irnmediately lost, t0 the ruiner of many, the last gjldor he had just snatched from tbe convulsiue grasp of the innocent: this mightbut be the resvlt of a certain dogree of knowledge, which wa\u017f not, however, capable of combating the cunning ofthe more experienced. Avbrey often wished ta represent this to his frlend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the rvin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delclyed it\u2014for each day he haped bis friend would giue him some opportunity 0f speaking frankly and openIy to him; bowever, this never oocurred. Lord Ruthven in his car riage, and amjdst the variouf wild and rich scenes af nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near tho object of his curiosity, he abtained na gre ater gratificatian from it than the constant excitement of vainly w ishing to break lhatmystery, which to his exalted imaginatian began to clssume the appearance of somethjng supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, ond Aubrey for a tjme lost sighl of his companion; be left him in doily attendance upon the rnorning circle af an Italian oountess,wbilst he went in search of lhe memorials of anothcr almosl deserted city. Whilst he was thus engagcd, letters arrived srom England, which he opened witbeoger impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the otbers were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagiriation that lhere was an evil power resident in his companion, thefe \u017feemed to give him suffjcient reason for the belief. His guardiaris insi\u017ftcd upon his immcdiately leaving his friend, ond urged, that his character was dreadfuIly viciovs, for that the possession of irresistible powers os seduction, rendered his lieentious habits rnore dangerous to soeiety. It had been discovered, tbat his contempt for the advltress had not originated in hatredof hcr character; but that he had required, lo onhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should he hvrled from the pinnacle of urisullied uirtue, down to tho lowest abyss of infamy arid degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of lheir virtue, had, fince hi\u017f departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole dcformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAu6rey determined upon leaving one, whose characterhad not yet shown a single b right p0int on wbich to rest the eye. He resolved to invenl some pIausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnotlced. He enterod into the same circle, and soon perceived, that bls Lordship wa\u017f endeavourjng to work upon the inexpericnco of the daughter of the lady whose house ho chicfly frequented. In Italy, lt is seldom thclt an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged t0 carry ori his planf in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon di\u017fcovered that an assignation had been app0irited, whlch would most li kely end lri the ruin of ari innocent, though lhoughtless girl. Losing no timo, bo entored the apartmcnt of Lord Ruthven, and ahruptly asked him bis iritenlions witb respect to lhe lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven anfwered, lhat his intenlions wcre such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being prossed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired;and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from tbat momerit he mu\u017ft decl-\nine accompanying his Lordship in lhe remajnder of their proposed tour, he ordered his seruant to seekolher apartments, and calling upon lhe mother of the lady, lnformed hor of all hc knew, riot only with regard to her davghter, but also concerning the ch aracter of his L0rdsbip. The assignation wcls prevented. Lord Ruthven nextday merely sent his servant to riotify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans hauing been soiled by Aubrey's interp0sition.\nHavlng left Rome,Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself ot Athens. He lhen fixed hlsresidence inthe house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records 0f ancient glory upon monumerits that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds offreemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many caloured lichen. Under the same roof cl\u017f himseIf, existed a being, so beautif ul and delicate, that fhe migbt have formcd the model f0r a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of lhe faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to lhose who had no fouls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mouritain's side,one would have th0ught the gazelle a poor type os her beauties; for who wovld have exchanged ber eye, apparenlly the eye of anima ted nature, forthal sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste af an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often aocompanied Aubrey in his search aster antiquities, and often wauld the unconscious girl, engaged in tbe pur\u017fuit af a Kasbmcre hutterfly, sbow the whole beavty af her form, floaling as it were upon the wind, to tbe eager ga2e of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an alin0st effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Oftcn would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such deljcately brilliant and swiftly fading hucs, it might well excuse thc forgetfulness of the antiquary, who lct escape sr0mhis mind theuory object he had before thought of vital imp0rtance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt wby attempt to describe charms which all feel, bul none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, arid beauty, vnaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling ballf. Whjlst he drew tbose remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, sho wovld stand by, and wclteh the magic effectf of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would theri describe to him the circling dance upan the operi plain, wou1d paint, to him in all the glowing colaurs of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irifancy; ond then, turning to subjects thal had evjderitly mado a greater iinpression upon ber mirid, would lell him all the supernatvral tales of her nurse. Herearnestness ond apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest evon of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the livingvampyre, who had passed years omidst his friends, and dearest tlcs, foreed every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, wbobad ot last dctected one living clmong themselves, after several of their near relcltives and children had 6een found markod with tbe sta mp 0f lhe fiend's appetite; and when sho found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, romarked, that those who had darod to question their existenee, always bad some proof given, whioh obliged them, with grief and heortbreaking, lo confess il was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of theso monsters, arid bis borror was increasod, by hearirig a pretty accurate descrjption of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still porsi\u017fted in persuading her, thal there could be no lruth in her fears, thoughat the same tirne he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a beliof in lhe supernalural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of thewomen clmong whom hehad sought for hjs vision of romonce, won bis heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habit\u017f, marrying an urieducated Greek girl, still he found himscIf more and more attached to the almost fai ry form before hiin. He would tear hlmsels at times froin her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his ohiect was attained; but be always found it iinpossible to fix his attcntjon vpon the ruins arourid him, wbilst in hi\u017f mind he rotained an image that seemed alone the rightful possefsor 0f bis thoughtf. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had flrst known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could vislt her favourite haunts, whil\u017ft her guardian was occvpied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the dcstructive hand of tiine. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, clnd they bolh, wilh several present, asfirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined t0 proceed upon one os his excursions, which was to detain bim for a few hourf; when they heard thc name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, wbere no Greek would ever remain, clster the day had closed, vpon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in lheir nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him wbo darcdto cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representati0ns, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring tbus to mock a supcrior, infernal power, lhe very nome of which clpparcntly madc their blood sreeze, be was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursiori unattended; he was surprised to observe tho melancholy face ofhis host, and was concemed to find that his words, mooking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them withsuch tcrror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse,arid earnestly begged of him lo return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, sooccupiod in his research, tbat he djd nol perceiue that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmerclimates, so rclpidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, movnted hif borse, determined lo make up by \u017fpeed for his delay: but it was too late. Twiligbt, in thcse southern climates, is almost unkriown; immediately the sun sets, nigbt begins: and ere he had advanoed far, the power of lhe storm was above\u2014its echoing lhunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its woy through thecanopyjng foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning scemed to fall and radlate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse t0ok fright, and he waf carried with dreadful rapidity through lhe entangled forest. The animal at 1asl, through fatigve, stopped, arid he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly liftcd itself up from the masses of dead leclves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter fr0m the pelting af the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment fjlent, allowed him to hear lhe dreadful shrieks 0f a woman mingling with the stifled, exul tant mockery of a lavgh, continued in one almost unbroken sourid;\u2014ho was startled: but, roused by the thunder wh ich again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced apcn the daor of the hut. He found hlrnself in utter darkness: tbe s0und, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceiued; for, though he called, still the sound\u017f contiriued, and no notice waf taken of him. He found blmse1f iri contact with some one, whom he immediately \u017feized; when a voi ce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laughsucceeded; and he felt himself grappled hy one whose strength seemod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, hc struggled; butil was in vain: he was lifted from hls seet and hurled with enormous force agajnst the ground:\u2014his enemy threw hjm self upon him, clnd kneeling uponhis breast, had placed hls hands up0n his throat\u2014when the glare 0f many torches penetrating through the ho1e that gave light in the day, difturbed him;\u2014he instaritly rose, arid, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a momcnt the crashing of the branches, as he broke tbr0ugh lbe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now slill; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light os their torches fell upon the mud walls, and tbe thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakcs os soot. At the desire of Avbrey they searched sor her who had attraoted him hy her cries; he was again left in darkness; 6ut whatwas his horror, when the light af the torches once more bursl upon him, to peroeive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shul his eyes, hoping that it was bvl a vision arising fr0m his disturbed imagiriation; but he again saw the same form, when he unoIosed them, stretcbed by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness abovt ber face that seemed almost as attaching as the life thal once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breasl wcl\u017f blood, and upon her throat were the marks of tceth having opened tho vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, fimultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vompyre!\" A litter was quickly sormed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of herwho had lately been to him the object of so mariy bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of Iife that bad died within her. He knew not wbat bis thovghts wore\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun refIection, and take refvge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had beeri found in the hut. Tbey were soori rnet bydifferent parties who had beeri engaged in thc search of her whom o mother had missed. Their lamenta6le cries, as they approached the city, farewarned the parerits of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be irnposfible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corsc. They were inconsalable; both died brokcn-hearted.\nAvbrey being put to bed was seized witha mosl violent fever, and waf often deIirious; in lhese inlorvals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unacoountable c0mbination bo seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other timos he would imprecote maledicti0ns upon his head, arid curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Atheris, ond, from whatever motive, vpon hearing of the slclte of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and becclme his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he was borrified and startled at the sight af him whose image be hod now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying alinost repentonce for the fault tbat had oaused their separation, and slill morc by the attentiori, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to bis presence. His lordship seemod quite changed; he no longcr appeared that apathetic belng who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence begari to be rapld, he again gradually retired into the same state of inind, and Avbrey perccived no dlfference from the former man, except that at times he was furpri\u017fed to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation p1aying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Dvring the last stage of the irivalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves rai\u017fod 6y the cooIing breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movcless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish lo avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sho ck, was much woakened, arid that elasticity of spirit which bad ance so distinguished him now seemed to bave fled farever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silen ce a\u017f Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude,his mind could not find il in the neighbourbood of Athenf; if ho sougbt it omidst the ruins he had formerly frequerited, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he s0ught it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst thc underwood, in quest os the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wourided thraat, wilh a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every seature of which crecltcd such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himfelf bound by the tender core ho had taken of him during his illriess, that they shauld vifit those parts of Greeoe neither hcld yet seen. They travelled in every direction, ond sought every spot to which a rocolIection could be attached: but lhough they thvs hastenod from place to place, yet lhey feemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these report\u017f, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In conseqvence ofthus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, onone occasiori they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow dofile, at tbe bottom of which was thc bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brougbl down from the rieighbouring prccipices, they had reason to repent their riegligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when tbey were \u017ftartled by the whlstling af bullets close to their heads, and by the cchoed report ofseveral guns. In an lnstant their gvards had left them, and, placingthemselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in lhe direction whence lhe report came. L0rd Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitating thoir example, retired for a momenl behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashained of being thus detained by a foe, wbo with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers shovId climbab0ve and take them in the rear, they determined at ance to rvsh forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost lhe shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot iri theshoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longcr heeding the contest or his owri peril, wassoon surprised hy seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards havjng, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediatcly lhrown up thejr arms aridsurrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced thern to convcy his wovnded friend to a neighbouring cabln; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being coritenl merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had ari order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification en\u017fued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not chang-\ned; he scemed af unconsciovs of pain as he had been of tho objects aboul him: bvt towards the closc of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may fave me\u2014you may do more lhan that\u2014I meon not my life, I heed the death os my existence as little as that of the pafsing day; but youmay saue my boriour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tel1 me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need hul little\u2014iny life ebbs apaco\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if youwould conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stajn in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unk nown for some lime in England\u2014I\u2014 I\u2014but lifc.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exvltant violence, \"Swear by clll yovr soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear thclt, for a year and cl day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to ariy livirig being in any way, wha tever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from lheir sockots: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk 1avghing upon his pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey retired to resl, but did not \u017fleep; the rnany circumstances attending his acquairitance with thjs mari rosc upon his mind, and he know n0t why; when he remembered hls oath a cold sbivering came over hirn, as if from the prescntiment 0f something horriblc awaiting him. Rising early jn lho morning, he was aboul to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robher mct him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself clnd comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it sh0uld be exposed to the first coId ray of the moon that rose afterhis death. Aubrey astonished, and taking sever cll of the men, determiried to go and bury it upon the spot wbere it loy. But, when ho had mounted to lhe summit he found no trace of either tbe corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on whjch tbey had laid the 6ody. For a time his inind was bewildered iri eonjeetures, but he at last returnod, c0nuinced that they had buricd thc corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met witb such terriblo misfortunes, arid in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitlous melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, ho resolved lo leave it, ond soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vef\u017fel t0 convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupied himself in arranging those cffects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthvcn. Amongst other things there was a case containingseveral weapons of offence, more or less adapted toensure the deatb of the victim. There were severaI daggers and ataghclns. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, wbat was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut\u2014be shuddered\u2014hastening to gairi further proof, he faund thc weapon, and his harror may be imclgined when he discovered thal it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hond. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seerned gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wishcd to disholieve; but the particular form, the same varying tintf upon the haft and sheath were alike in spleridour on hoth, and left no room for doubt; lhere were also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on his way home, at Rome, his flrst inquiries were coricerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from L0rd Rutbven's feductive clrls. Her porents were in dislress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under fo many ropeated horrors; he was afrclid thal this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and filent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, af if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wil1, \u017foon wafted him to lhe Engl isb shores; ond ho hastened to the mansion of his fathcrs, and there, for a inoment, appeored to lofe, in the embraces and caresscs of his si\u017fter, all memory of the past. If shc before, by her irifantirie caresses, had gained his clffection, now tbat the woman began to appear, she wa\u017f still more attaching a\u017f o companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gajnsthe gazc and applcluse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy whicb only exists in the healed otmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by thc levity of the mind beneath. There was a me1ancholy charm about it which did not seem toarise from misfo-\nrtune, but from some feelirig within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step wcls not that light sooting, whjch slrayf where'cr a butterfly or a colour may attracl\u2014it was sedclte and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened 6y the smile of joy; bul wheri her brother breathcd to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for thclt of the volvptvary? It seemed as if tbose eyes,\u2014thclt saco were then playing jn the ligbt of thcir own riative sphere. She was yot only eighteen, and had nol been presented to the wor1d, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should be delayed unlilher brother's return from the continent, when he might be her prateclor. It wasnow, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which wos fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"b usy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered bim. He could not soel interest about the frivalities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events ho had witnessed; but he determined to sacrjfice his own comfarl to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared sor lhe next day, whjch had been annouriced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room bad nol been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the fmile of royalty, hastened thither. Aub rey was there with his sisler. While he was standing in a oornor by himsels, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remombrance that thc first time he had seeri Lord Rutbven was in that very place\u2014he felt hjmself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he rccognized tao well, fovnded in his ear\u2014\"Remem6er your oath.\" He had bard1y courage to turn, searful of seeing a spectre thal would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distancc, the same figure which had attracled his notice ori this spot upan his first entry int0 society. He gazcd tjll his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through tho crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven h0me. He paced the room with hurried sleps, and flxed his harids upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burfling from hif br ain. Lord Ruthuen again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the decld rise again!\u2014He thought hi\u017f imaglnation had conjured up the image his mlnd was resting upon. It was impossible tbat it could be real\u2014he determined, therof0rc, to go again inlo society; for though he altempted to ask e0ncerning Lord Ruthven, lhe name hung upon his lips, and he could not succecd in gclininginformation. He werit a few nights after with his sister to lho assombly of a near relation. Leaving hcr under the protection of a matron, he rotired inlo a reeess, and thcre gave himself up to his own dcvouring thoughts. Perceivlng, at last, that many wereleaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparcntly in earnest canversaliori; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested to move, tvrned round, and reveoled to him those features be most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sistor's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards the \u017ftreet: at tbe door he faund himsels impeded by lhe cr0wd af servants who were wcliting sor their lords; and wbile he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voicc whisperclo\u017fe to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare toturn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reaebed home.\nAubrey became cllmost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's livirig again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unhoeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only utlered a fewwords, and th0fe terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewjldered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon hi\u017f breath, amidst all he held doar, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been tauched by him. But everi if he were to break his oath, and disclo\u017fe his suspiclons, who would belicve him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wrelch; but death, heremcmbered, had 6een already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when hifsifter came, who, with eyes streaming wjth teors, besought hiin, for her sake, to support nature. At last, ri0 longer capable of 6earing stillness and solitude, he Ieft his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that imagc which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to lhe noon-day suri as to the rnidnight damps. He was no 1anger to be recognized; at first he returned with the euening t0 lhe house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherevcr fatigve overto0k him. Hjs sistor, anxious far hi\u017f safety, employed people to follow him; but they were saon distanced by hirn who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by hjs absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determjned to entcr again into society, and wot ch bim close1y, anxious to sorewarn, in spite af his oath, all whorn Lord Ruthven approclched with intimacy. But when he entered into a ro0m, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sjster was clt last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, remonstrance praved unauailing, the gvardlans thought properto interpose, arid, fearing that hismind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed vpon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving hirn from the injuries and sufferings ho had daily encountered in his wariderings, and 0f preventing hiin from exposirig to the general eye those mclrks of wbat they considered folly, they engoged a physlcian to reside in the house, and take constanl care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so eompletely was hls mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at lasl so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wou1d 0ften lje sor days, incapablc of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had altained a glassy lustre;\u2014the anly sign of affection and reeollection remaining disp-\nlayed itself upon the entry os his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing ber hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch hlm\u2014ifyaur love for rne is aught, do riot go near him!\" When, however, she inquirod to whom he rcferred, his only an\u017fwer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sarik into a state, whence not even sbe could rouse him.This lasted many m0nths: grcldually, however, os the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequenl, and his mind threw off a portion of its glooin, whilst his guardians observed, that sevcral timcs in the day hc would counl upon his fingers a definite num6er, and then fmile.\nThe time had nearly elapfed, when, upon the last day of the ycar, one of his guardians entering his room, beg an to coriverse with his physieian upon tbe melancholy circumstanco of Aubrey's being in so awful a siluation, when his sister was going next day to he married. Instantly Auhrey's attention wa\u017f attracted; he asked anxl0u\u017fly to whom. Glad of lhis inark of returning intellect, of which they feared be had been deprived, they mentioned the riamc of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom ho had met wlth ln society, Aubrey seemed plea\u017fcd, and astonished them still more by bisexpressing his intention to bo present at the nuptials, and desiring to soe his sifl-\ncr. They answered nol, but in a few minutes hlssister wos with him. He wa\u017f apparently again capable of being affecled by lhe influence of her lovely fmile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kjssed her cheek, wet with lears, flowirig at the thought of her brother's being once more olive to lhe feelings os affeetion. He 6egan to speak with all his wonted warrnth, and to congratulatc ber upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and everyaccomplishment; when ho suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at 6eholding the features of the monster who had so long influencod his ljfe. He seized the portrait in a paroxy\u017fm of rage, and lrampled it under fool. Upon her asking bim why be thus destro yed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if hc did not understand her\u2014then seizing ber hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her sweor that she would never wed thism0nster, for he\u2014 Bul he could not advance\u2014it scemed as if that voice again bade bim remcmber his oath\u2014he lurned sud-\ndenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the rneantime the guardians and physician, who had hoard the whale, and thought this was but cl return of his disorder, entered, and f0rcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired ber to leave bim. He fe1l vpon his knees to thein, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributlng this to the irisanity they imagiried had laken poss ession of his mind, endeavoured to pacifyhim, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had called the mornirig aster the drawing-room, and had beeri refused wilh every one else. When he beard of Aubrey'\u017f ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but wben he learned that he wcls deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those ainong whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his sormer companion, and, 6y oonstant altendance, and the pretence of greal affectlon sor the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dongers and loils to recount\u2014cauld speak of himself as os ari individual having no sympathy with any being on tbe crowded earth, save with her ta whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, sirice he knew ber, his existence, had begun to seem warthy of preseruation, ifit were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in firic, he knew so well how to ufe thc serpent's ort, or such was the will of fate, thal he gained ber affections. The title of the elder branch faIling at length to him, be obtained an important embassy, which served as on excuse for hastening tbe marriage, (in spite of her brothcr's deranged state,) which was ta toke place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrcy, when he was left by tbe physician and his gvardjans, attempled to brihe the servonts, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given bim; hewrote a letter to his slster, oonjuring her, as she valued her awn happiness, her 0wn hanour, andthe honour of those now in the grave, who once ho1d her in their arms as lhoir hope and the hope of their hous e, to delay bvt for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses.The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, hc thought it better not to harass any more the mjnd of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings os a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may moro easily be conceived than descrjbed, the notes of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound af carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew alm0st frantic. The curiosity of tbe servants at laft overcame their vigilance, thcy gradually \u017ftoIe away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. Ho seized the opportunjty, with one bound was out of the room, arid in a moment sound himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, specchless wilh rage. When on the slaircose, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if nol my bride lo day, your si\u017fter is dishonoured. Wornen are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, wha, r0usedby the old woman, had carne in \u017feclrch of him. Aubrey could no longer support himsels; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-ves\u017fel, and he was eonveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sisler, who was not presenl when he entered, as the physician was afraid os agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride clnd bridegroom left London.\nAvbrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced syinptoms of tbe near approach of death. Hc desired his sjster's guardians might be called, ond when the midnight hour had struck, he relatod composedly what the reader has perused\u2014be died immediately after.\nThe guardian\u017f hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrivod, jt was too late. Lord Ruthven had disoppeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted tho tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grcoian Archipelago, on board oneof his Majesty's ve\u017fscls, in the year 1812, we pul into the harbour of Mitylene, iri the islarid of that name. The beouty of lhi\u017f place, and the certain supply of eattle and vegetables alwclys to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountiosamply repay for the deviatlon of a voyage. Wo landed; as usval, at the bottom of the bay, and wbilst the meri were employed in watering, and tbe purser bargaining for cattlo with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and ather places, where we had been before. On tbe brow of Mount Ida (a smallmonticule so named) we mel with and engaged o young Greek as our guide, who told us he bad come from Scio with an Eng1ishlord, wbo left theisland four days previous to our arriva1 in his feluoca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said lhe Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; bvt I did not choo\u017fe ta quit Mitylene, where I am likely to gel rnarried. He was an odd, but a very good man. Tbe cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge os it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechjnes for lt, (about Lz50 Engljsh currency,) and has resided there about sourtecn months, though not constantly;for he sails lri hjs feluccauery 0ften to the different i\u017flands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time iri hclstening to the house where our countryman had resided. We wero kindly received by an ald mcln, who conducted vs over the mansion. It consisted of fovr apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an enlrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, arid a bed-room, with a spaciaus closet annexed. They were all sjmply decorated: plain grcen-stained wall\u017f, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the ceritre, clnd a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed jn the side of a small bronze Venus ln a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. Iri thc hall stood ha1f a dozen English cane chairs, and an emply book-ca se: there wore no mirror\u017f, nora single painting. The bedcbamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floar, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pil low\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sltting-room we observed a marblc recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: lt was open, but we did not think 0urselves juslified in exomining tbe contents. On the tablelof the recess lcly Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Valney's Ruins of Empires;Zimmerman, in the Germon language; Klopstock's Messioh; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lo\u017ft, an Ita-\nlian edition, printed at Parma in 18I0; several small pamphlots from the Groek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no Eng1ish book of any descriptiori. Most of thesc baokswere filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, ln Ilalian and Latin. The Mossiah was litorally soribbled aIl over, and marked with slips of paper, ori whieh also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The l0rd had been readi ng these books the evening before be scliled, and forgot to placc them with the others; but,\" soid he, \"there they mvft lle until his relurn; for he is so parlicular, that were I to move one thing withaut arders, he wouIdfrown upori me for o week together; he isotherways very good. I once did hjm a sorvice; and I bave the prodvce of this farm for lhe trouble of taking care of it, oxcept twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from AdrianopIe; I dan't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the hovse exlemally was pleasing. The portico in front waf fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work c0rnices, (as it is riow cuftomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The r0of, svrr0unded by a light stone balustrado, was c0vered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning os strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thvs furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings iri smoking, drinkjng light wines, \u017fucb as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and eniaying the evening breezo.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grclp-\nes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and vnder the shade of two large myrtIe bushes, a marble seat with an arnamental wooden back wcls placed, on whioh we were t0Id, the lord passed many of his ovenings and nighls till twelve o'c1ock, readirig, writing, and talkingto hiinself. \"I suppose,\" said theold man, \"praying\" for he wos very devout, \"and always attcnded ourchurch twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards Ied the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees iri blo0m, and on the summit of which an anc ient Greek temple appeared in majestic dooay. A small stream issuing from lhc ruins descended in broken caseades, untiI it was Iost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and anhorizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in f ront; and a little on the left, through a uista of lofty cbesnut clnd palm-trees, seueral small islands were dislinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spotf of emerald green. I seldom onjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were frvltless as lo lhe name of the person who had residod ln this romanlic solitude: norie knew his name but Dorninick, his banker, who had g0ne to Candia. \"The Arrnenian,\" said our canductor, \"couId tell, but I am sure he willnot,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, 0ld friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I oan,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our rcturn to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolatod lord. He had portioned elgbt young girls wheri he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nvptial feast. He gave a cow ta 0ne man, horses to others, arid cotton arid silk to the girls who live by weaving these artlcles. Ho also bought a new boot far a fisherman wha had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testainents to tho poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric clnd benevolenl character. One cireumstanco we leornt, which our old friend at the cottclge thought proper not to disolose. He had a most boautiful daughter, with whom the l0rd was aften seen walkirig on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, clnd taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch wcls the insormation with which we departed from the peaceful isle af Mitylene; our imagiriations all on tho rack, guessing who this rclrnbler in Greece oould be. He had money lt was euident: he had philantbropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar gonivs. Arrived at Palermo, all our dou6ts were dispelled. Falling ln company with Mr. FOSTER, the arcbitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greoce, \"The indlviducll,\" said he, \"about whoin you are so anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met hiin in my travels on the islarid of Tenedos, and I alsa vis-\nitod him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's famo, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chjlde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recogriized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply djd we regret not having been more curious in our rescarches at the cottage, but weconsoled ourselves with the idca of relurning to Mitylene on some future day; hut to me that day will never return. Imake thi\u017f statement, be1ieving it not quite uninleres ting, and in justice to hi\u017f lordshjp's good name, wbich has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling dispasition, averse to assaciating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add lo its pleasures. The faet is directly the roverse, as inay be plainly gathered srom these little anecdotes. All the firier feelings os the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendernoss, sympathy, and charity appearto guide all bis actions: and hi\u017f courting thc repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heclrt Religion hath set ber seal, and over whose head Benevolence halh thrown hermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"t raits\" without feeling proud of him as a eountryman. Wjth respect to his loves 0r pleasures, I do not assume a right to give anopinion. Reports are ever to be recoived with caution, portieularly when direclcd against man's morcll integrity; and he who dares justify hlmself hefore that awful tribvnal where all mu\u017ft clppear, alone may censure the errars of a fcl1ow-mortal. Lord Byron'f charaeter is worlhy of his genius. To do goad in secret, and shun the world's applauso, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-courl, Fleet-street.","31":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polldorl\nTHE superftitlon upon which lhis tale is founded is very general jn the East. Among the Arabians it appoars to be cominon: it did not, however, exlend itself to lhe Greeks until afler the establishmcnt of Christiclnity; and it has only assumed its presont form since lhe division of the Latin and Greek ohurches; at which time, the ideo becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried iri their terrilory, it gradually increased, and f0rmed the subject os many wonderful stories, still extarit, of tbe dead rlsing from their graves, and feeding upon the hlood of tbe young and beautisul. In the West it spread, with same \u017flight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, wherc the belief exlsted, that uampyres nigbtly imbibed a certain portion of thebload of their victims, who bec ame emaoiated, lost their strength, ond speedily died of consumptions; whilft these hvman blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to causc the blood to sIow from aIl the pasfages of their bodies, clnd even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a eurious, and, of course, credible account af a particular case of vampyrism, which js stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examlnation of the cornmander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positiveIy and unanimously affirmed, that, abovt five years before, a certaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassouia,on thc srontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormerited by cl uampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with hjs blood. This precaution, however, did n0t prevent him srom becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twerity or thirty days after hjs deathand burial, many persons comp-\nlained of hclving been tormented by him, and a deposition was rnade, tbat four persons had heen deprived of lise hy his attclekf. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usval in cases of vampyrism) frcsh, and enlirely free from corruplion, and emitling at lhe movth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to lhe accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through theheart andbody of Amold Pclul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alivo. Tbis done, they cut off his head, burned his body, ond threw the ashes into hls grave. The samc measvres werc adoptod with the cor\u017fe\u017f 0f those persorif wbo hod previously died from vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their t urn, become agenls upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himseIf, and sucks in his turn.\nChiof bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomontade ls hcre related, becavse it seoms better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observatians than any other instance which could be adduce d. In many parts of Greece it is confidered as a sort os punishment after death, for fome heinous crime committed whilst in exlstence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyrise, but compelledto confine his lnfornal visitation\u017f solely to those beingf he loved most while upon earth\u2014thase to whom ho was boundby ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A suppofition alludedto in the \"Giaour.\"\nBvt first on earth, as Vampyre fent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native placc, And suck the bIood of all thy rclce; There from thy dclughter, sister, wife, At midnightdroin the stream of life; Yet loathe lhe banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere theyyet expire, Sha1l know the demon for their sire; As cursing thec, thou cursing thern, Thy flowers ore with-\nered on lhe stern. But one that for thy crime must foll, The younge\u017ft, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a fclther's namc\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her oheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezos o'er its lifeless blve; Then with unbclllowed hand shall tear The tresses of heryellow hair, Of which, in 1ife a lock when shorn Affection'f fondest pledge was warn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thirie 0wn best blaod shall drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggard llp; Then slalking to thy sullcn grave, Go\u2014clnd with Gouls and Afrils rave, Tjll thesein borror sbrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has al\u017fo introduced in hls wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse 0f the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented cls having returned fromthe grave for the purpose os tormenting him sbe best laved whilst in existonce. But this cannol be supposed to have resulted froin the sinfvlness of ber life, shc being pourtrayed throughoul the who1e of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracio u\u017f Tournefort gives o long account in his travels of several aslonisbing cases of vampyrism, ta which he pretends to have been an eyewitne\u017ff; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides o uariety of arieodotes, and traditionary narratives illvstrative of its effee-\nts, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible suporstition migbt be added; though the present may suffiee for the limitsof a riote, riecessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may naw be concluded by merelyremarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, mado use of in vclrious part\u017f of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened lhot ln the midst os the dissipations attendant vpon a London winter, thcre appoared at the variovs parties of tbc leadcrs of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only ottracted bis attention,tbat hc might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those brea-\nsts where thoughtlessriess reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whenee it arase: some attributed it to the dead grey eye,which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward w0rkings af the beart; but fell upon the cbeek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarilies caused him to be invited to evory bouse; all wished t0 \u017fee him, and th0se who had been accustomed to violent excitemerit, and now felt the woight of ennvi, wore pleased at hauing something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spile of the deadly hue of his face, which neuer goined a warmer tint, either froin the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emolion of passion, though its form and outline werc beautiful, many of the femalc hunterf after notoriety attempted t0 win hls attentions, and gain, al least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockery os every monster shewn iri drawing-rooms since her morriage, threw herself in his way, and did all butput on the dress of a mountebank, lo attract his notice:\u2014though jn vain:\u2014when she stood before him, thougb his eyef were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seomed as if they were vnpercejved;\u2014even hor unappalled impudence was 6affled, and sbe left the field. Bul though the cornmon adultress could not influencc even the guidance of his eyes, it wcls not that the female sex wasindifferent to hiin: yet suoh was the apparcnt caution wlth which he spoke to lhe vlrtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew be euer addressed hjmself to femaIes. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular charaoter, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred ofvlce, he was as ofteri among those femaIes who form the boast of thelr sex from thoir domestic virtues, as clmong those who sully lt by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon a yourig gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an anly sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parerits who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himfels by gvclrdians, who tbought it their duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more iinportant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary\u017fubalterns, he cultivated more bi\u017f iinagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high roman-\ntic feeling of honour and candour, which dai1y ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thovghl that vice was lhrown in by Providenoe merely for the picturcsque effect of the scene, as we see in romanoes: he thought that the misery of a cattclge merely consisted in the vesling os clothes, which were as warm, but which were bctter adaptedto the painter's eye hy their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, srank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay cjrcles, many mothers surraunded him, striving which should describe with least trutb their languishing or romping favourites: the daughter\u017f at the same time, by thejrbrjghtening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon Ied him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary bours, he was startled at finding, thot, except in the tallow ond wax candlesthat flickered, not fram the presence of a ghost, but from wclnt of snvffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congerios of pleafing pictures and defcriptions contained in those valumes, from which he bad formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensatlon lri his gratified vanity, he was a6out to relinquish hjs dream\u017f, when the extraordinary being we bavo above described, orossed him in hiscareer.\nHe wcltched him; and the vcry impossibility of forrning an idea of the character of a inan entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few 0ther signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacjt assent to their existence, iinplled by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatiori to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extrauagant ideas, he soon forined this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to obserue the offspring of bis sancy, rather thon the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, clnd so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually lcarnt lhat Lord Rutbvon's afsairs wero embarra\u017fsed, and soon found, srom the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informcltion respecting this singulor character, wbo, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiaris, lhat it was time for him to perform the lour, wbich for many generations has been thovght neces\u017fary to enable the young lo take some rapid sleps in the caroer os vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them lo oppear as if fallen frain thc skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or os praise, according to the dcgroe of skill shewn in carrying them on. They conserilod: and Aubrey immediatcly mentioning his intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a praposcll to join him. Flattered by svch a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in commori with other men, he gladly accepted lt, and in a few days they had pasfed the eirolirig waters.\nHilhcrto, Aubrey had had no opporlunity of studying LordRvthuen's character, clnd now he found, that, though mony more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from lhe apparent m0tives to his conduct. His coinpanion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from his hand m0re than cnough ta relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could n0t avoid rema-\nrking, that it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indlgence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virlue, that he bestowed his olms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when the profligate came to ask f0mething, nol to relieve his wonts, bul to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him ftill deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, altributed byhlm to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generalIy prevails over the retiring bashfulness of thc virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was ftill more impressed upon his mind: a1l those upon whorn it wos bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and lhe most abject misery. At Brussels and ather towns through which they passed, Aubrey wa\u017f surprlzed at the apparent eagerness with which his companion s0ught for the centros os all fashjonable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table:he betted, and cllways gombled with success, excepl where the known sharper wos bis antagonist, and then he lost even inore than hc gained; but it was always wlth the same uncbangirig sace, with whicb he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encounlered the rash youthful ri0vice, or the luckless father of a numerovs family; then his very wlsh seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of thc cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he lest lhe formerly asfluenl youth, torn from the oircle be ad orned, cursing, in the folitude of a dungeon,the fate thal had drawn him within the reach of thls fierid; whilst mariy a father sat fraritic, omidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherowith ta buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of mariy, the last gilder he had just snatched fram the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mlght but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, howevor, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to reslgri tbat charity and pleasure wbich proved tho ruin of al1, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but ho delayed it\u2014for eoch day be hoped his friend would give him some apportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however,this never 0ccurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, bc obtained no greater grolification from it than the constant oxoitement os vainly wishing to break that mystery, whicb to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of samething supernatvral.\nThey soon ar rjved at Rome, and Aubrey for a tiine last sight of his companion; hc left him in daily attendance upori the mornirig circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went jn search of the memorials af anather almost deserted city. Whilsl he was thus engaged, lettcrs clrrived srom Englarid, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was froin bi\u017f sister, breathing nothlng but affection; the others were fram his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imaginatiori that there was an evil power resident in his cornpanion, these seemed to give him svfficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately 1eaving his fricnd, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, f0r thatthe possession of irresistible powcrf of seduction, renderod bis 1icentious babits more dangerous lo society. It had been dlsco vered, that his eontempt for the adultress had not originated jn hcltred of her charactcr; but that he hcld required, to enhance bis gratification, that his viotim, the partner of his guilt, shou1d be hurledfrom the pinnacle of unsullied vir tue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: iri fine, tbat all those semales whom he had sought, apparently on accaunt of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, andbad not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whofe character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to jnvent some plausible pretext for abaridoning him altogether, purposing, in the meclri while, to watch him more closely, and to Iet no slight circumstarices pass by unnoticod. He enterod into the same circle, and soon perceived, that bis Lordship was cndeavouring to work upori the inexperience ofthe daughter of the lady whose h0uso he chjefly frcquented. In Ita1y, it is seldom thot an vnmarried female is met with in society; he was there fore ob1iged to carry on his plans in seeret; but Aubrey's eye followed hjm ln all his wiridings, and soori discovered that an assignation had beeri appointed, whlch would most likely end in the ruin of an innocont, though tboughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked him hi\u017f intent ions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time thot he was aware of his being about to meet her tbat very nighl. Lord Ruthven answered, thal his intenlions were sueb as he supposed oll would havo uponsuch an occa\u017fion; and upori being pre\u017fsed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; ond, immediately wrjlinga note, to fay, that from thal momcnt he must decline accompanying his Lordshlp in the rcmainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to \u017feek other apartinents, and calling upon the mother of the Iady, infarmed her of all he knew, not anly with regard to ber davghter, but also concernirig the character of his Lordship. The assignalion was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to n0tify his c0rnplete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans hauing been foilod by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and cro\u017fsjng the Peninsula, foon found himself at Athons. He then fixed his rosidencc in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traoing the faded records of anoient gIory vpon monuments that clpparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freomen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneclth the sbeltering soil or many colouredlichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a helng, so beautiful and delicate, that sho might have formed the model for a painter wishing lopourlray an canvass the pramised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke to0 much mind for ony one to thjnk she could belong to tbose who had no sauls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped al ong the mountaln's side, onewould have thought the gazeIle a po0r type of her beaulies; for who would have excha nged her eye, apparcntly the eye of animated nature, sor tbat slecpy luxuri0us look of tbe animal fuited but to the taste of an epicure. The ligbt ftep of Iclntbe 0ften accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged jn the pursuit of a Kashmerc butterfly, \u017fhow the who1e beauty of her form, floatlng as it were upon the wind, to the eoger gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered vpon an almo\u017ft offaced tablet, in the contemplcltion of her sylph-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, cls she flilted around, exhibit in lhe \u017fun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excvse lhe forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mjnd the very object hehad before th0ught os vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passagc jn Pausanias. But why atternpt to descrihe cbarms which all feel, but none can clppreciate?\u2014It was jnnocencc, youth, ond 6eav ty, unaffected by cro wded drawing-rooms arid stiflirig balls. Whilst he drew lhose rem ains of which he wished to preserve a mernoriclI for his future hours, she would stand hy, arid watch the magic effects of his perieil, in traoing the scenes of her natjve place; she would then describe to him the circling danoe upon thc open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful meinory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and tben, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater lmpression upon her mlnd, would tell him all the supernalural tales of her nurse. Her earnest ness and apparent be1ief of what she narrated, cxcited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the taleaf the 1iving uainpyre, who had passed yeors amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femalo to prolong his exi\u017ftence forthe ensuing month\u017f, his blood would run eold, whilst he attempted lo laugh her out of such idle and horrible faritasies; but Ianthe cited to him the namef of old men, who had at last detected one living am0rig themseIves, after several af lhoir near relatjvef and children had been sound marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she sound him so iricredulou\u017f, fhe begged of hirn to beliove her, for it had been, remarked, that those wbo had dared to question their exjstence, aIwclys had some proof given, which0bliged lhem, wjth grief and heartbreaking, to confess it wa\u017f trve. She detai1ed to him the traditional appearonce of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate defcrlption of Lord Ruthven; he, however, stil1 persisted in persvading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excile a bellef in the superncltural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted wilh aIl the affected uirlucs of the w0men among whom he had sought for his vision os romance, won hif heart; and while he ridiculed the idea os a young man of EngIjsh habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, \u017ftill ho found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form bef0re him. He would tear himself at timcs srom her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined riot t0 return untl1 his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fjx his attention upon the ruins around him, whilsl in bis mlnd he relained an image that seemed alone the rjghtful possessor of his thoughls. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was euer the same frank infantile being he hcld fjrst known. She always seemed to part from hjm wjth reluctance; but it wa\u017f because she had no longer any one with whom she could visil her favourlle haunts, whilst ber guardian was occupied in sketchlng or uncavering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructiue hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, clnd tbey botb, wilh several present, affirmed their exi\u017ftence, pale wjlh horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of bis excur\u017fions, which was to detain him sora few hours; whon tbey heard the name of the place, they oll at once begged of him riot to return at nighl, as ho mvst necessa rily pass through a wood, whero no Greek w0uld ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgics, and dcnounced the rnostheavy evjls as imperiding upon him who dared lo cross their path. Aubrey made light of theirrepresentations, and tried t0 Iaugh them oul of tbe idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infemal power, the very name of whlch apparently made thoir blood free ze, he wos silent.\nNext morning Aubrey sel off up0n his excursion unattended; he was surprised toobscrve the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, inocking the belief of thofe horrible fiends, had irispired thern with svch terror. When be wos a6out to deparl, Ianthe came to the side af his horse, and earnestly 6egged 0fhim to return, cre night allowed the power of thcse beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so oocupied in his research, that he did not perceiue that day-light would foon end, and that in thehoriz0n there wos one 0f those specks which, in the warmer climales, fo rapjdly gathcr into a tremondous mass, and pour all their rclge upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, delermined lo moke upby speed for his delay: but it was too lale. Twiligbt, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: ond ere he had odvariced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rairi forced its way through the c anopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hjs very feet. Suddenly his horse took sright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entanglcd forest. The animal at last, throvgb fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in tbe rieighbourhood of a hovcl that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leavef and brushwood which surrounded it. Dism0unting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to thc town, or at least trusting lo obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, aIIowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman miriglirig with the stifled, exu1tant mockery of a lclugh, continued in one almost unbroken sovnd;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whjch again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided hirn. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the founds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He fovnd himself in contact with fome one, wham be immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again bafflcd!\" lo which a loud lavgh svccceded; and ho felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determincd to sell his life as dearly as be covld,he \u017ftrugglcd; but it was in valn: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upori him, ond kneeling upon his breast, had plaoed his hands upon his throal\u2014wheri the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014be instantly rose, clnd, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of thc branches, as he broke thr0ugh the wood, wa\u017f ria longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual ftraw with heavy flakes of soot. At tbe desire of Aubrey lhey searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but whclt was his horror, when tbe light of the torches once more 6urst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his foir coriductre ss brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising frorn hls di\u017ftur6cd imagiriation; but be agairi saw the saine f0rm, when he unclosed them, slretched by his side. There was no coIour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that scemed alm0st as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her thr0at were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this tho men pointed, crying, simultancously struck wjth borror, \"A Varnpyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was qvickly formed, and Aubrey was Iaid by the side of her who had lalely been to him the objecl of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of llfe that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014hismind was benumbed and \u017feemed to shun reflectian, orid take refuge in vacancy\u2014he heId almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruetion, which had heen found in the hut. Thoy were soon met by differ ent parties who had been engclged in the searohof her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentab1e cries, af they approached the cjty, forewamed the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To descrjbo their grief would be iinpossib1c; but when they ascerlained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolabIe; both died brokon-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in lhese intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccounlable combination he seemed to bog of his sormer companion to spare the being ho loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, irnmediately placed himself in thc somc houso, and becamc his oonstonl attondanl. When tbe latter recouered from his delirium, he waf horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had naw combined with thal of a Varnpyre; but Lord Rulh-\nven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separatian, and still more by the atteriti0n, anxiety, and care whlch he showed, soon reconciled him lo his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; be no longer appeared that apothetic boing who had so astonished Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence 6egan to be rapid, he agajn gradu-\nally retirod into the same state of mind, clrid Aubrey perceived no difference from thc former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, wlth a smile of malieious exultation playing upon his lip\u017f: he knew nol why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engoged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling bree2e, or iri marking lhe progress of thoseorbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish lo avoid the eyof of all.\nAvbrey's mind, by this shock, was much wcakened, arid that elasticity of spirit which hcld once so dlstingujshed him riow seemed to havo fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitvde and silencc as Lord Ruthven; 6ut much as he wifhed for solitude, hls mind oould not find lt in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst tbe ruins he had formerIy frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest af the modest violet; then su ddenly turning round, would show, to hjs wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smi1e vpon her lips. He determined to fIy scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associatlaris in his mind. He praposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by lhe tender care he had takon of him during his illness, thol they shovld vifit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb a reoollection cou1d be clttached: but tbough lhey thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mucb ofrobbers, but they graducllly began to slight thcse reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interost it was to exeite the generosity of t hoso whom they defended from pretonded dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inbabitants, on ane occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upori entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbovring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the porty engaged in the nclrrow pass, when they were starlled by the whistlirig of bul-\nlets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an inst-\nant their guards had Ieft them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun t0 fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their examp1e, retired for a moment behind the shellering turn os the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a f0e, who with insulting shouts bade them aduance, arid being exposed to unroslstirig slaughtcr, if any of the robbers sh0uld cl imb a60ve and take them in the rcar, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the she1ter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shovlder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to hif assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, wa\u017f soon surprised by feeing the robbers' facef around him\u2014his guords having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up tbeir arms ond surrendered.\nBy promisesof great reward, Aubrey soon indvced themto oonvey bis wounded friend to a neigbbouring cahin; and havingagreed upon a ransom, he was no inore dislurbed by their presence\u2014they being content rnerely to guard the entrarice till their comrade should retum with the prarnised sum, for whichhe had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification erisued, and death seeined advancing with hasty stcps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of lhe objeets about him: bul towards lhe olose af tho lasl evening, his mind hecame apparentlyuneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer bis assistonce with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you moy save me\u2014you may do more lhan that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence cls little as that of lhe pasfing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me haw? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cann at exploin the whole\u2014bvt if you wou1d concoal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and jf my doath were uriknown for \u017fome time in England\u2014 I\u2014I\u2014but lise.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known. \"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried tbe dyirig man, raising himself with exultanl violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nclture fears, swear tbat, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to ony living being in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their socketf: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he surik laughlng upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; lhe many circumstonoes attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mlrid, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a eoId sbivering came over him, as if from the presentiment os somethlng horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hoveI in whjch he had left the corpse, wben a robber met him, arid informed him that it was no 1onger there, having been eonveyed by himself clnd camrades, upon hif retiring, to the pinna-\ncle of cl neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had g iven his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray 0s tho moon lhat ro\u017fe after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taklng several 0f the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot whore it lay. But, when he had m0unted lo the summit be faund no trace of either the corpse or tbe elothes, though the rohbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on whicb they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but hc at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in whioh he bad metwith such terriblemisfortunes, and in which al1 appareritly conspired to heighten that supersliti0us melancholy that had seized upon his mirid, he resolved to leave it, ond soon arrivcd at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessol lo convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself jn arranging lhase effects he had wilh hlm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things lhere was a case containingseveral weapons of offence, rnore ar lefs adclpted to ensure the death of the viotim. Therc were several daggers and ataghans. W hilst turriing them over, and examining their curlous forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the \u017fame style as the daggordiscovered in the fataI hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found lhe weopon, and his horror may be imagined wheri he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eyes seemed to noed no further certainty\u2014thoy seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet slill he wished to dis6elieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike jn splendour on both, and lefl no room for doubt; there were also drops of b1ood oneach.\nHe left Smyrno, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their forlune ruined, and sbe had nol been heard of \u017fince the departure of his lordship. Aubrcy's mind became alinost broken under so rnany repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fcll1en a victim to tho destroyer of Ianthe. He became m orose and silerit; and his only occupalion consisted in urging the \u017fpeed af tbe postilions, as if he were going to saue the ljfe of some one he held dear. He arrived clt Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to tho inarision of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appearod lo lose, in the embraces and caresses af his sisler, all memory of tbe past. If she before, by her jnfantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appoar, she was still more ottaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubroy had not that winning grace which gairis the ga2e and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none os that light 6rillianoy which anly exists in tbe heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by lhe levity of the mind boneath. There wasa meIancholycharm aboul it which did not \u017feem to arise from mlsfortune, but froin some foe1ing within, that appeared to indlcate a soul conseious of a brighter realm. Her step waf not that ligbt footing, whioh strayf where'er a butterfly or a colour may attroct\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When a1one, her face was nevcr brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in ber prescnee forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged hcr smile for lhat of the voluptuary? Il seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then plclying in the light of their own native spbere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not heen prescnted to the wor1d, it having been th0ught by her gvardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed unti1 her brother's return from the continenl, wheri be might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved lhot the next drawing-room, which was fost approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into lbe \"bu\u017fy sccnc.\" Aubrey wovld rather have remained in the mansion of his fatbers, ond fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about tbe frivoljties of fasbionable strangers, when his mind had boen so torn by the events he had witnessed; bul he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to lhe protection of his sjster. They soon arrivod in town, and prepared f0r tbe next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious tohask in the smile of royalty, hastened thilher. Avbrey was there with his sister. While he was slanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remem6rance that the first time he had seen Lard Ruthven was in that vory place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, ond a voice he recognized toa well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Rememher your oath.\" He had hardly co vrage ta turn, fcarful of seeing a speclre tbclt would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure whicb had attractedhis notice an lhif spot upon his first entry into sooiety. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friond, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixod his hands upon his head, as lf he were asraid his thoug hts were bursling from bis 6rain. Lord Rut hven again besore him\u2014circumstance\u017f started up in dreadfvl array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roufed hirnsclf, he covld riot believe it possible\u2014the dead rise agajn!\u2014Ho thought his imclginatiori had conjured vp the image hjs mind was resling upon. Itwas lmpossible that it could be real\u2014he dclermined, therefore, to go ogain into society;for though he attempted to a\u017fk eoncerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with hi\u017f sister t0 the assembly of o near relalion. Leaving her under lhc protection of a matron, he retired into o recess, and tbero gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perccivjng, clt last, that many were leaving, he roused himsclf, and cntering another room, found his si\u017fter surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pas\u017f and get near her, when one, whom he requested to inove, turned round, and revealed to him thofe features he most obhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, wjth hurrjed step, forced her towards the street: at the door he faund himself impeded by the crowd of servants wh0 were waiting for their lords; and wbiIe ho was engaged in passing them, he agairi heard that voice whi\u017fperclose to him\u2014\"Remember your oalh!\"\u2014He dld riot dareto turn, but, hurrying his sister, saon reached home.\nAubrey became alm0st distracted. If before hjs mlnd hcld 6een absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certalnty 0f the monster's liv ing again pressed upon his thoughts. Hls sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vclin thal shc lntreated him to explain to her what had caused bis abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thovght, the more be was bcwildcred. His oath \u017ftartled hjm;\u2014was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held deor, and not avert itsprogress? His very sister might have beeri touched by him. But even if he were lo break hi\u017f oath, and disclose his su\u017fpicions, who would bolieve him? He thought of omploying his own hand to free tbe world frornsucb a wretch; but death, he rememhered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in lhis state; shut up in his room, he saw no 0ne, and ote only when his sister come, who, with eyes \u017ftreomirig with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer copable of bearing stillnoss and solitude, he left his house, roamod from ftreet to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became negleeted, and he wandered, as osteri exposed to the noon-day sun as to tho midnight damps. He wa\u017f no longer to be rocognized; at first he returned with lhe evening to lhe house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sifter, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wero soon diftanced by him who fled from a pvrsuer swifter than any\u2014from thougbt. His conduct, however, suddenly chongcd. Struck with lhe idea that he left by his clbsence the whole of his friends, with a siend amorigst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter agaln into society, and watch bim closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite os his oath, all whoin Lord Ruthven approacbed witb iritimacy. But when heentered into cl room, his baggard and suspicjous looks were so \u017ftriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to bog 0f hjm to abstain from seeklng, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrclnce praved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpase, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allenaled, lhey thought it high timc to r esume again that trust which had been besore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parent\u017f.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily onoountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing ta the general eye those marks of whal theyconsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the houso, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so complelely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incohorence bccame at last so great, that he was confined to bls chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of boing rovsed. He had become emaciated, his eyes bad altained a glassylustre;\u2014the only sign of affection arid recollection rcmaining displ ayed itself vpon lhe entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, ond, sei2ing her hands, with Io oks tbat severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch hlm. \"Oh, do not t0uch him\u2014if your lave for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, howeuer, sho inquired to whom he referred, bis only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again hc sank inta a state, whence not even she cau ld rouse him. Tbls lasted many months: gradually, howeuer, as the year was passing, his lncaherences became 1ess frequent, and his mind threw off o portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that sevora1 times in the day he would count up0n his fingers a definite nvmber, and tben smile.\nThe timc had rioarly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, onc of his guardians eritering his room, began toconverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumslance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his si\u017fter was goingnext day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's altention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returnlng intellect, of which lhey feared hc had been deprlved, they mentianed the name of the Earl of Mar sden. Thinking this was a yaung Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed plcased, and astonished them still more by his expresfing his intention lo be present at lhe nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They onswered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by lhe influenee of her lovoly smile; for he pressed her t0 his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flow-\ning at the thought af her brolher's being oricemore alive to the feelingf of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congrcltulate hcr vpon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accom plishinent; when ho suddenly perceived a locket upon her breaft; opcning it, what was his surprife at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus deslroyod the resomblance of her future husband, he looked as if hc did n0l understand her\u2014then seizing ber hands, arid gazing on her with a frantic expression os countenance, he bade ber swear that she wovld never wed this inonster, for he\u2014 But be c0uld riot advanee\u2014il seemedas if that uojce again bclde hiin remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly rovnd, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meontime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this wa\u017f but cl retum of his disorder, entered, ond forcing him from Miss Aubroy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of thern to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeauoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming aflor the drawing-room, and had been rcfusedwith overyone else. When he heard of Aubroy's jll health, he readily underftood himsels to he the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasvre could hardly be concealed srom those among whom he had gained this informatjon. He hastened to tho house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenee of great offection for the brother and interest in bis fate, be gradvalIy won lhe ear of Mis\u017f Au6rey. Who couId resist his power? His tongue hcld dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as os an individual having no sympatby with any being on the crowdod earth, \u017fave with her to whom he addressedhimself;\u2014could tell haw, sin ce he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it were merely that hc might liston to her soathing accents;\u2014in fine, hc knew \u017fo well how to use the serpenl's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling clt length to him, he obtained an important ombassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brothor's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day beforo his departure f0r the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servonts, but jn vain. He askcd for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sifter, conjuring her, cls she valued her own happiness, her own hanour, and the honour of those now in lhe grove, who oncc held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of tbeir house, to delay but sor cl few hours thot marriage, on which he denouncod themost heavy curses. The sorvants promised tbey would deliver it; bvt giving it to the physician, he thougbt itbetter not to harass any more tbe mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, lhe ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest lo the busy inmates of the bouso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easlly be conceiued than described, the notes0f busy preparation. Morning came, and lhe sovnd of carriages brake upon his ear. Aubrey grcw almost frantic. Tbe curiosity os the servants at last overcamc their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leclving birn in tho custody of an helpless old woman. He sejzed lbe opportunity, wlth one bound was out of tbe room, and in o moment found himself in the apclrtment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive bim: he immediotely appr0clched, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Wben on the stajrcase, Lord Ruthvenwhlspered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brlde to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushedhim towards his attendants, who, r0used by the old womon,had come in search of him. Aubroy could na longcr support himself; his rage not flnding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bcd. This was n0t mentioned to his sjster, who was not present when he entored, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriclge was solemnized, and the bride arid bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness iricreased; the effusion of blood produced sympt0ms of the near approachof death. He dosired his sister's gvardians might be called, and when tbe rnidnight hour bad struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guclrdianshastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but whon they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glulted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tho world was all before him, where to choose his plclce of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through tbe Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majefty'\u017f vesse1s, jn the year 1812, we put inlo the harbovr of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of lhis placc, and the certain suppIy of cattle and vegotable\u017f always to be had thero, induce many British uessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and mercha-\nntmen; and though jt lies ratber out of lhe track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for thc deviation of a voyage. We landod; as usual, al the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargclining for cattlc with the natives, the clergyman arid myself to0k a ramble lo the cave called Homer's Sch0ol, and 0ther placcs, where we had heen before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met witb and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had c0me from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our a rrival in his felvcca. \"He engaged me as a pi1ot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I djd not cbo0se to quit Mitylene, whcre I am likely to get married. He was an 0dd, but a very good man. The cottagc over the hill, facing the rivor, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines sor it, (about L250 English currency,) and has residcd there about fourteeri manths, though not coristantIy; sor he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nTbis accovnt excited our curlosity very much, and we lost no time in hasteriing to the house where aur counlryman had re\u017fided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartmcnts on the ground-floar\u2014an entrance hall, o drawing-room, a sittirig parlovr, and a hed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decoraled: plain grecn-stained wcllls, marhle tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could bemade to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed iri the side of a \u017fmall bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or s0fa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half o dozen English cane chairs, and an ernpty book-case: there were no mirror\u017f, nor a single painting. The bedcbarnber had merely a lorge mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common 6ed throughout Grcece. In the sitting-rooin we observed a marblc recess, formerly, the ald man told us, filIed with books and papers, whioh were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselvesjustified in examlning the contents. On tbe tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Sbakspeare's, Bojleau's, and Rousseou's works coinplete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Me\u017fsiah; K0tzebue's novels; SohilIor's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edltion, printed at Pa rma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these baoks wore filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribhled all over, and marked wilh slips af paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading theso books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they mvstlie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I lo move one thing withovt orders, he would frowri upon me for a week together; he is otberways vory g0od. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care os it, except twenty zechines whlch I pay to an aged Armenian who rosides in a srnall cottage in tbe wood, clnd whoin the lord brought here froin Adrianople; I don't know for what reoson.\"\nThe appeoronce of tbe bouse externally was pleasing. The portico jn front was fifty paces lorig and fourteen broad, and the fluted marblc pillars with black plinlhs and sret-work corriices, (cls it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were c0nsidorably hjgher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, benealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houso-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their eveningf in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoyirig lhe evening breeze.\nOn the left hand af we enler ed the house, a small \u017ftroclmlel glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustoring together on its borders, and under the shade of two largcmyrtle bushcs,a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back wa\u017f placed, on which we were lold, the lord passed many of his euonings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading,writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he wa\u017f very devout, \"and always attended our ehurcb twice a week, 6esidos Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termod \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line os rieh virieyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, coveredwith olive and myrtle trees iri bloom,and on the summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestic decay. A small streclm isfuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was last in tho woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glclss, and an borizon unshadowed by a fingle eloud, termiriates lhe view in front; and a Iittle on lholeft, througb a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, severcll small islands were distinctly obserued, studding the llghl blve wove with spols of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries wore fruitlcfs as to the riame of the person who had rosided in this romantic solitude: none know his name but Dominick, hjs banker, who had gane to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conduct0r, \"oould tell, bul I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on ovr return lo the town we learntfeveral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon tho island, and evon dariced with them at the riuptial feast. Ho gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the glrls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fjsberman who had lost his own in a gale, and he oflen gave Greek Teftaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to uf, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and henevolent character. One circumstance we lcarnt, which ovr old friond at the cottoge th0ught praper not to disclose. Hc had a most beauliful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bougbt her a pian0-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information wjth which we departed from thc peaceful isle of Mjtylene; our imagiriations all on the rack, guessing who lhis rambler in Greece could be. He had money it wos evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricjties which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovbtswere dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arcbltect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been traveIling in Egypt and Greece, \"The indivjdual,\" said be, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordshjp's fame, cls we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put irito our hands we reeognized the recluse of Calcla in euery page. Deeply did we regret not having been more ourious in our researches at the cottclge, but we conso1ed ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on somc future day; but to me that day will never return. Imake lhis statement, belleving it not quite uninterestirig, and in justice to his lordship'f good name, which has been grossly slandored. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human naturo, or contributing in any way to footh its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The sact is direclly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little aneedotes. All thc finer feelings of tbe heart, fo elegaritly depicted in hi\u017f lordship's poems, soem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose hcad Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man cari read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feoIing proud of him as a countrymari. Wjth respect to his loves or p1easuref, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Rcports are ever to be received with caulion, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares j ustify himself before thclt awful tri6unal where all must appear, alone inay censure the errors af a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's characteris worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the sureft tcstimony of a vjrlvous hearl and self-approving confcienoe.\nTHE END\nGi llet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","32":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is foundcd is very general in tho East. Among the Arabians it appears to be cammon: it did not, bow-\ncvor, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only a\u017fsumed its presont form since the division of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body oould not corrupt lf buried in tbeir territory, it gradually increased, and formed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, stilI extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon lhe b1ood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with somc s1ight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exislcd, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, losl their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst lhese human 6lood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to svch a state of ropletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all thc possages of their bodies, and everi from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of Maroh, 1732, is a ouri0u\u017f, and, os course, credible ac count of a particular case of vampyrism, which i\u017f stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It clppears, that upon on examination of thc commarider-in-chief and magistratos of the place, they positively and unanimovs1y clfsirmed, that, about five years bef0re, a certclin Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiors of the Turkish Servia, he bad been tormented by a varnpyre, but had f0und a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating somc of the earth oul af the vampyre's gravc, and rubbing himsels with his blood. This precautiori, bowever, did not preverit him from becoming a vampyre hlmself; for, about twenty or thirty doys after his deatb and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attaeks. To prevent further mischies, the inhabitants having consultedtheir Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases af vampyrism) fresh, and entire1y free from corruption, and einitting clt the moutb, nose, and ears, pure clnd florid blood. Proaf having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at whlch he is rep0rted to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they eut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The some measures were adopted with the o0rses of tbose persons who had proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their tvrn, b ecome agents vpon otbers who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by avampyre hecames o vompyre hlmself, and sucks iri his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to i1lustrale the subject of the present o6servations thari any 0lher instance which c0uld be adduced. In many parts os Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftcr death, far some hciriovs crime committed whilst in exjstonce, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrlse, but compelled lo confine his infernal visitations solely lo thoso beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014tbose to whom he was bovnd by ties of kiridrcd and af fection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eartb, as Vampyre sent, Thy corfe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, Aridsuok the blood of all lhy race; There from thy daughter, sisler, wife, At midnight drairi the stroclm 0f life; Yetloathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livjd livirig oorse, Thy victims, ero they yet expire, ShaIl know tbe demori for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloued 0f all, Sball bless thee with a sather's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heclrt in flame! Yet thov musl end thy lask and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glclssy glance must view Which freezes o'er itf lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hand shall tear The trosses of her yellow bair, Of which, iri life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borno awoy hy thee Memorial of thirie agony! Yet with thine own best blood fball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to tby svllen grave, Go\u2014arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away Fr0m spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sou-\nthey bas also introduced in his wildbut beautiful paem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian majd Oncizcl, who is represenled as having returried from the grave for the purpose of tormentlng him she best loved whjlst in existenee. Bvt this cannot be supposed to hclve resulted from tbe sinfvlness of her life, she bejng pourtrayed througbout the whale of lhe tale as a complete type of purity and jnnoeence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long aecount in his travels of severaI clstonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, jn his groat work upon this subject, besides a uariety 0f anecdotes, and traditionary narrcltives illustrclliue of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to provc it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrib1e superstitjon might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limits of a note, nocossarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be coricluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general clcceptation, there are seueral otbers synonymovs with it, made use af in var-\nious parts of the world: as Vrouoolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dis\u017fjpatioris attendant upon a London winter, there appoared at the various parties of the leader\u017f of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gozed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participale lherein. Apparently, tbe ljghl laugh ler of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where lhoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose:some attributed it to lhe dead grey eye, which, fixirig upon tbe obiect's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce throvgh to the lnward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek witb a leadcn ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities eaused him to bc invited to euery house; all wjshed to see him, and those wbo had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now selt lhe weight of ennui, were plcased at hauing something in their presence copable of engaging their attention. In spile of thedeadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from lhe strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntersafter notoriety attcmpted to win hjs attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of whol they mightterm affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfter shewn in drawing-rooms since her marrlage, lhrew herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she ftood before him, though hjs eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed os if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unclppolled impvdenee waf baffled, and she left the field. But though the common odultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyef, it wcls not that lhe female sex was indlfferent to him: yet such was lhe apparerit caution with which he spokc to the virtuous wifeand innocent daughter, lhat few knew he ever addressed himself to fomales. He had, however, the reputotion of a wjnning tongue; and whether it was tbat it evenavercame the dread of his singular chclracter, or that lhoy were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who forin lhe boast of their sex from their doinestic vir tues, as among those wha sully it by their viccs.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman 0f the name af Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sifler in the possession of great weallh, by pclrents who died while he was yet in ohiIdhood. Left also to him-\nsclfby guardians, who thought it thejr duty rnerely to take care of his fortune, while they relinqui\u017fhed the more important charge of his mind lo the care of mercenary subaltems, he cu1tivated more his im aginalion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many mil1iners' apprentices. Hebelieved all to sympathise with vjrtue, and thought thal vice was thrown in by Providence merely forthe picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a coltage merely consisted in the vestirig of clothes, whlch were as warm, but wbich were better adaplcd to the painter's eye by their irregular foldf and various col0ured patches. Ho lhought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the recllities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his enterlng into the gay circles, many mothers surraunded him, \u017ftriving which sh0uld describe with least truth tbeir 1anguisbing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened hi\u017f lips, soon led him into falfe notions of his talents and hls merit. Attached cls he was to the romance of hjs solitary hours, he was startled at flriding, that, except in the tallow and wax oandles that flickered, not froin the presence of a ghost, but frorn want of snuffing, there wcls no foundation ln real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and desoriptions contained in those v0lumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, s0me compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to reliriquish his dreams, when the oxtraordinary being we have above described, crossed hirn in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbe very impofsibi1lty of forming an idea of the character of a man entireIy ahsorbed iri himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the lacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowlng his imoginalion to piclure every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forined this objeot into the hero of a romance, and determlned to observe the offspring 0f his fancy, rather than the per\u017fori before him. He becarne acquainted with him, pajd him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence wcls always recognised. He gradually 1earnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and saon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Streot, that he was aboul t0 travel. Desirous af gaining some infarmation respecting this singular chclr acter, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it wcls time for him ta perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enablo the young to take some rapid slepf in the eareer of vice towards putting themseIves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing thein to appear as lf fallen fromthe skjes, wbonever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as lhe \u017fubjecls of pleasaritry or of praise, accordingto the degree of skjll shewn in carrying them on. Thcy confented: and Aubrey immediately menlioning his intentions ta Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of csteem from him, who, apparently, had nolhing in cornmon with other men, ho gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Auhrey bad had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now hc found, thot, though rnany more of his actlons were exposed to his view, the results offered different coriclusions from the apparerit motives to his conducl. His oompanion was prosuse iri his liberolity;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enougb to relieve their immediate want\u017f. But Auhrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virtuou\u017f, reduced to indigence by tbe misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bcstowed his alms;\u2014these were senl from the door with hardly svppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something,not to relievo his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chority. This was, however, altribvted byhim to the greater importunity 0f the vicious, whicb gcnera1ly prevajls over the retiring bashfulne\u017fs of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more linpressed upon hls mind: all those upori whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that lhere was a cu rseupon it, sor they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and lbe most abject misery. At Brussels and other townf through which they pa\u017fsed, Aubrcy was surprized at the apparent eagerne\u017fs with which his compani0n sought for tbe centros of all fashionoble vice; there he entered into all tbe spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except wbere the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it wa\u017f always wilh the same unchanging face, with which he gcnerally watohed the society around: it was not, however, so when he encounteredlho rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerou\u017f famjly; then his very wish seemed fortune's lclw\u2014this apparent abstractednes\u017f of mind was laid aside, and hif eyes sparkled wjth morc fire than that of the cat whjlst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he lest the formerly affluenl youth, torn srom the cjrcle he adorned, eursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reaoh of this fiend; whilst rnany a father sat frantic, amid\u017ft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immensc wealth, wherewith to buy eucn sufficient to sotisfy t hejr present craving. Yet he tookno maney fram the garn6ling tablo; bvt immediately l0st, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snalched from lhe convulsive grasp of tbe innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledg e, which waf not, howevcr, capable of combating the ounning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wished to roprefent this lo his friend, and beg him to resign that cbarity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but be delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped bis friend would give him some apportunity of speaking frankly and openly tohim; howeuer, tbis never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes af nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than hls lip; and though Aubrey was riear the 0bjoct of hls curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing lo break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived atRome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of hl\u017f coinpanion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morriing cir cle of an Italian covntess, whilst he went in search of the memarials of another almost deserted city. Whllst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, hreathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter a\u017ftonished him; if it had before entered into his imaginatjon tbat thero was an evil power residenl in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upori his iminediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreodfully vicious, for that the possession os irresistible powers of seduetion, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to socioty. It had been disoovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not origiriated jn hatred of her character; but tbat he had required, to enhance his gratificati0n, that his victim, thepartner of hjs guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnacle of urisul1ied virtue, dawn to the lowest abys\u017f af infamy and degradation: in fine, tbclt all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtuc, had, since his deparlure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled t0 expase thc whole deformity of tbeir vicef to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character hadnot yet shawn a single bright point on which to rcst the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning bim altogether, purposing, intho mean while, to watchhim more elosely, and to 1et no slight circumstonces pass by vnnotioed. He eritered into the same circle, and soon perceived, thclt his Lordship was endeauouring to work upon the inexperience af the daughler of the lady whose house he chief1y frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was th erefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of ari innoeent, though tboughtloss girl. Losing rio tirne, he entored the aparlment of Lord Ruthven, and abrvpt1y asked him his iritentions with respeet to the lcldy, infarming him at the samc time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Rutbven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and uponbeing pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avbrey retired; and, immediately writing a n0te, to say, that from that rnoment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant t0 seek other apartments, and colling upon the mother of the lady, iriformed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also conce-\nrning tbe oharacter of his Lord\u017fhip. The assignalion was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day morely sent his seruant to riotify hi\u017f complcte assont to cl separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interpositlon.\nHavirig left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and cross ing the Peninsula, soon found hjmself al Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so0n accupiedhimself in tracing tho faded records of ancient glory upon monuments thal apparently, ashamed of chr0nicling the deeds of freemen only before slavef, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltoring soil or many coloured llchen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a beirig, so beovtiful and delicate, that she might have f0rmed the mode1 for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahoinet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to tbjnk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountaln's sidc, one wouldhave thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, appclrently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look af the animcll suited hut to the taste of an epicure. The light stop of Ianthe often accompaniod Aubrey in hissearch after antiquities, and osten would thc unconscious girl, engaged jn the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show thc whole beavty of her form, floaling as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he bad just docyphered upan an almost effaced tabIet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray svch delicateIy brilliant and swiftly fading bues, it might well cxcuse the forgetfulnefs of the anliquary, who let escape from his mind the very obicct he had before thougbt of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a pclssage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can apprecjate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffectedby crowded drawing-rooms and stisling bal1s. Whilst he drew those remains of wh ich he wished to presorve a memorial for his futurehours, fhe would stond by, and watch the mogic effects of his pencil, in tracing the seenes af her riative p1ace; she would then describe to hirn the cireling dance upori the open plain, would paint, to him in clll the glowing oolourf of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaney; and tben, turning to subjects that had evidenlly made a greater impression upon hcr mind, wovld tell hlm all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestne\u017fs and apparent bclief of what she narrated, exciled the interest even os Aubrey; and often af she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who bcld pas\u017fod years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced overy year, by feeding vpon the life os a lovely female to prol0ng his existence for the ensuing montbs, his blood wouId run co1d, whilst he attempted ta lough her oul of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to hlm the nclmes of old men, who had ot last detected one Iiving among themselves, after several of their near relalives and children had been found marked with thc stamp of the fiend's appetite; arid when shc found him so incredulous, she begged of him t0 believe her, for it had 6ecn, remarked, that those who had darod to qvestion theirexistence, olways bad some proof given, wbich obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the trclditiona1 appearance of these monstor\u017f, and his horror was lncreased, by hearing a prelly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in per\u017fuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at tbe same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended lo excite a belief jn the supcrnatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtves of the womcn among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his hearl; ond while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greck girl, still he fovnd himse1f more and more attached to the alinost fairy sorm before him. He would tear himse lf at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determinod not to return until his object was attained; but he always fourid it imp0ssible to fix his attention upon thc ruins around him, whllst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the righlful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconseious of his love, and was ever the samo frank infantile boing be had first knowri. She always secmed to part from him with relvctance; but it wcls because she had no longer any one with whom she covld visit her favourite havnts, whjlst her guardian waf occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructlve hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, offirmed their existence, pale with horror at the vory name. Soon after, Auhrey detormined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which wos lo detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as be must neces\u017farily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day hod closed, upon any consideratiori. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to crass thejr path. Aubrey made 1ight of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw lhern shudder at his daring lhus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very riame of whioh apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattonded; he was surprised lo ob\u017fe-\nrve the melancholy face of his host, and was coneerned lo find tbat his words, mocking the belief of those hor rible fiends,had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came ta the side of his horse, clnd earnestly begged of him lo relurn, ere night allowed the power of thefe beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, lhat he did not perceivo that day-light would soon end, clnd that jn the horizon there was ane af those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremond0us mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at 1ast, however, m0unted his horse, determined to make up 6y speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern cllmates, is almosl unknown; immediately the sun sets, nighl begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the st0rm was above\u2014its ech0ing thuriders bad scarcely ari interval of resl\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying folioge, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate ot his very feet. Suddenly his horfe took fright, and he wcls carried with dreadful rapiditythrough the entangled sorest. The animal atlast, tbrough fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaues and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one ta gujde hirn to the town, or at least tru-\nsting to obtain shelter from the pelling 0f the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, sor a moment si1ent, alIowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the tbunder which agairi rolled over his head, he, wlth a sudden eff0rt, forced open the door of the hut. He found hlmself in utter darkncss: the sound, however, guided him. Ho wa\u017f apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found hjmself in oontact with fome one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agairi baffIed!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by 0ne whose strength seemed superhuman: determinod ta sell his life as dearly af he could, he strugg-\nled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with onormous force against tho ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon bis breast, had placcd his bands upon hls throat\u2014when the glare os many toro-\nhcs penetratingthrough lhe holc lhat gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, 1eaving his prey, rufhed through the door, and jn a moment the crashing of the brancbes, as be broke tbrough the wood, was rio longer heard. The storrn was now still; and Aubrey, lncapable of moving, was soan heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatcb l0aded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desiro of Aubrey they searched for her who had attraeted him by ber cries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but wbat was his borror, when thelight of the torches once more burst upori him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a Iifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hopjng that it wcls but a vision arising from hls disturbediinagination; but he agajn saw the same form, wheri he unclosed them, stretched by his fidc. There was no colour upon her cheok, nat even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness abaut her face lhat secmed almost as attaohing as the 1ise that onoe dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breost wos blood, and upon her throat were lhe marks of leeth having opened the vein:\u2014to thif tbe men pointed, crying, simu1taneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was q uick1y formed, and Aubrey was loid by the side af her who had lalely been to him the object of so many 6right and foiry visions, now fallen with lhe flower of life thal had died withjn her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benum6ed and seemed to shun rcflection, and take refuge in vocaney\u2014he held almosturiconsciously in hif hand a naked dagger of a particular c0nstruction, whieh had been sound in the hut. They wore soon met by disferent part-\nies who had beeri engaged in the search of her wh0m a mother had misfed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned tbc parents of \u017fome dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they asoertained thc cause of lheir child's declth, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. Tbey were incorisolable; both died broken-heartcd.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, arid was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upori Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion lo spare the being he loued. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, ond cur\u017fe him as her destroyer. Lord Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive clt Athens, and, from whatever motivc, upan hearing of the state af Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the some house, and beoamo his constant clttendant. Whon tbe lattor recovered fromhis delirium, he was horrified and startled ot the sight 0f him w bose image he had riow comhined witb tbat of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, implying alm0ft repentance for the fault lhat hcld caused theirfeparatiori, and sti1l more by the attentlon, anxiety, and oare which he showed, soon reconciIed hiin to his presence. His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared tbat apatbetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as \u017foon a\u017f his canvalescence began to be rapid, he agoin gradually rotired into the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he waf surprised to meet his ga2e fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inal icious exultation playing upori hjs lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Durlng the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Rvthuen wcls apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress os those orbs, clrcling, like our world, the moueless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyos of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much wcakeried, and that elasticity of spirit whicb bad once so distinguishedhim now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of so1itude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wi\u017fhed for solltude, his mind c0uld not find it in the neighbovrhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst lhe rulns he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form staod by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwaod, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throal, with a meek smile upon ber lips. He determiried to fly scenes, every feature of whleh created such b itter assaciations in his rnind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom hc held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him duringhis illness, lhat they should visit th0se parts of Greece neitber had yet seen. They lravelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attachod: but though they thus hastened from place to place,yet they soemed not t0 heed what they gazed upon. Thcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which lhey imclg-\nined were only the invention of individuaIs, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those wbom they defended froin pretended dangers. In consequonce of tbus neglecting the adviceof the jnhabitants, 0n one oecasion they travelled with only a sew guards, more to servo af guidcf than as a defon ce. Upon entcring, however, a narrow defile, at the botlom of wbich was the bed of a torrenl, with lorge masscs of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they bad reoson to repent their negligence; for scarcely wero the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when lhey were startled by the whist1ing of bullels close t0 their heads, and by tho echoed report of several guns. In cln instant their guards had lefl lhem, and, placing thomselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the repart came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shelloring turn os the defile: but ashamed of being tbvs detained by a soe, wbo with insulting shouts hade them ad vance, and beirig exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should elimb abovc andtake them in the rear,they dctermined at once to rush forward in search af the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven recejved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him t0 thc ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no langer hoeding the contest 0r hjs own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards hauing, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately lhrown up their arms and surreridered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induccd thom to corivey his wounded friend to a neig hbouring cabin; and havirig agreed upon a ransoin, he was no inore distvrbed by their preserice\u2014they being eontent merely to guordthe entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which hc had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in tw0 days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing wilh hasty fteps. His conduet and appeorance had notchanged; he scemed as unconscious of pain af he had been of the objects about him: bvt towards tbe cIase of the last evening, his mind became apparenlly urieasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! yov may save me\u2014you may do more thari that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death 0f my existence as little cls that of the passing day; 6ut you may save my honour, your frierid's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot expIain thc whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my hanour were freo from \u017ftain iri the world's rnouth\u2014and if my dealh were unknown for some time in Englarid\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himsels with exultanl violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fears, sweclr that, sor o year and a day you will not lmpart your knowledge os my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or wbatever you may seo. \"\u2014Hjs eyes seemed bursting srom their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillaw, and brcathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; tho many circumstances attending his acquaintance with lhis man rose upon hjsmind, and he knew not why; when he reinembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, af if from tbc presentiment os something horrjble awaiting him. Rising early in tho morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left tho corpse, when a robber met him, arid informed him that it was n0 longer there, having been coriveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinriacle of a neighbouring mount, acoording to a promise lhey had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking sevoral of the men, dctermined to go ond bury il upon the spot where it lcly. But, wben ho had mounted to the summit he found nolrace of oither the corpse or the clothes, tbough the robbers sw0re they pojnted out tho identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a timehis mind was bewildered in corijectures, but he at last returned, conviriced that they had buried the corpse for thc sake 0f the clothes.\nWeclry of a country in whicb he had met wjth \u017fvch terrible misfortunes, and in whjch alI apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy lhat had seized upon his mind, he resoIved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna.Wbile waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Nclples, he occupied himself in arranging thosc effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthuen. Amangst other things there was o case containing several weapons af offence, m0re or less adapted to enfure the death of the uictim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst tuming them over, and examining their curious forins, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamonted in the sclmo style as the dogger disoovered in the fatal hut\u2014he fhuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined whon he discovered that it filted, though peculiarly shaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazingto be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelicve; but the particular form, the same varyjngtints upon the haft and fheath were alike in splendour on b0th, and Ieft no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe Ieft Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquirjes were coneerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivo arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortvne ruined, and sbe hod not been beard of since the departure af his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost br0ken under so many repeated horrors; he was afrajd that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He bccame morose and silent; and his only occupation cansisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held declr. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedi cnt to his will, soon wafted him lo the Engli\u017fh shores; and be hastencdto the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraoes and cares\u017fes of his fister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinecaresses, had goined his afsection, naw that the woman began to appear, she waf still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assemblics. Thcre was none of that light briIliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Hcr blue eye was never Iit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy c hclrm about it which did not seem to arise from inisfortvne, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicatc a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a bulterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was ncver brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathcd to her his affecti-\non, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would hove exchangod her smile for lhat of the volvptuary? It seemed as is th0se eyes,\u2014that face werc then playlng in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eigbteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought hy herguardians rnore fit that her prosentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, wben be might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that thc next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her cnlry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would ratber have remainod in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the srivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind hadbeen so tornby the euents he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort tothe protection of hls \u017fister. They soon arrivod in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-ro0m.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not 6eeri hcldfor a long time,and all who were anxious to bask in lhe smile of royalty, haftened thither. Aubrey wos lhere with his sister. Whi1e he wcls standing in aoorner by hjmself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the slrst time he had seen Lord Rulhuen waf in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddonly \u017feized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in hj\u017f ear\u2014\"Remember your oalh.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fea rfvl of seeirig a spectre that would blclst him, when he perccived, at o little distance, the same flgure wbich had attracted his notice on this spot up0n bis first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a possage lhrough the crowd, he threw himself into bis carriage, and was driveri home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed hjf hands upon hishead, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burstjrig from hjs brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe it p0ssible\u2014the dead rise clgain!\u2014He thought hls imaginallon had conjured up the image his inind was resting upon. It was impossible that it covld he real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nlghts after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leoving her under the protection of a matron, he retlred irito a recess, arid there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leavirig, he roused himself, and ontering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appare-\nritly in earriest conversatjon; he attempted to pass and gct near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and rcuealed to blm those features he most abhorrod. He sprang forward, seized his sister'f arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards thc street: al the doar he found himseIf impeded by the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing thern, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your 0ath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, so0n reached home.\nAubrey became almost djstracted. If before his mind bad been absorbed by one subject, how mucb more eompletely was it engrossed, now tbat the certainty of the monsler's living again pre-\nssedupon his thoughts. His sister's attentioris were now uriheeded, clnd it wos in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only utte red a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hi\u017f 0ath startled him;\u2014was hc tben to alIow this mon\u017fter to roam, 6earirig ruln upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert ils progress? His very sister might hclve beentouched by him. But even if be were to break his oath, and discl0se his suspicions, who wouId believo hiin? He thought of cmploying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had beeri cllready mocked. For days be remained iri this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capahle of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, clnxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became noglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the n0on-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; al sirst he returned with the evening to thehouse; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue avertook him. His sister, anxiouf for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His coriduct, however, suddcnly changed. Struck with the idea that he lefl by hif ahsence tho whole af his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose prcsence they were unc0nfcious, he determined lo enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But whcn he enlered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was ot lasl obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to inlerpo\u017fe, arid, fearing that his mind wos becoining aljenated, they thought it high tjme to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parent\u017f.\nDosirouf of saving him from thc injuries and sufferings be had dai1y encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from expasing lo the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physiciari to reside in the housc, and take constant care of hlm. He hardly appeared t0 notice it, so completely wos his mind obsorbed by one terrible subjeot. His incoherence becclme at la\u017ft so greclt, that he was corifined to his chamher. There he would often lie sor days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remairiing displayed ilself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimos start, and, scizing ber hands, wlth looks thatseverely afflicted her, he would desirc hor not to touch him. \"Ob, d0 not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, howcver, she inquired to whom be reserred, his only answer was, \"True!true!\" and agaln he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted mariy moriths: gradually, however, as the year was passing, hif incoheronces became less frequent, and hjs mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, thclt several times in the day ho would count upon his fingers a de firiite number, and then smile.\nTbe time had nearly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the year, one of bis guardians entering hls room, began to oonverse with hi\u017f physician upon the melancbolyclrcumstance of Aubrey's 6eing in so awful a situation, when bis sister was goirig next day to be inarried. Instant1y Aubrey's atterition wcls attracted; he afked anxiously to whom. Glad 0s thi\u017f mark of retumlng intelleet, of whjcb they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned tho name of the Eclrl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in socicty, Aubroy seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his exprefsing his intention to be prosent at the nuptiols, and desiring to seo bis sister. They answered not, but in a sew minutes his sister was wjth him. Hc was apparently agoin capable of beirig clffected by the influence of her lovely smile; sor he pressed her to his breaft, and kissod her cheek, wet with tears, flowing ol the thoughtof her brol her's beirig 0nce more alive tothe feeljngs of affection. He began to speak with oll his wonted warmth, and to congratuIate her upon her marrjage with a person so distinguished for rank and every clccomp1i\u017fbment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the featvres of themonster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trompled it under fo0t. Upon her asking him why he tbus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked a\u017f jf he did nat under\u017ftand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on hcr with a frantic cxpression of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would ncver wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he cou1d riot advance\u2014it seemed as if that v oice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he tumed suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the wbole, and lhought this was but a return of bif disorder, ontered, and forcing him fr0m Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his kriees to them, ho implored, he begged of them to delay but for onc day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had takon possession of his mind, endeavoured to paoify him, ond retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the m0rning after the drawing-room, and had been refused wilh every one elso. When he heard of Aubrey's ill healt b, he reodily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be c0ncealed fr0m those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the hov\u017fe of his former companion, and, by constarit attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won tbe oar of Miss Av6rey. Wha could re\u017fist his pawer? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of hirnself as of an individuaI having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed bimself;\u2014oould tel1 how, since he knew her, his existence, hcld begun to seem worthy of preservatiori, lf lt weremerely that he might ljsten lo her so0thing aocents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how t0 use the serperit's art, or sueh was the wil1 of fate, thathe gained her affectians. Tbe title of the elder branch fallirig at lengtb to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take pIace the very day before his departure for the conlinent.\nAubrey, when he was lefl hy the phy\u017fielan ond his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in uajn. He asked for pen clnd paper; it wa\u017f given him; he wrote cl letter to his sister, conjvring ber, as shevalued her own happinesf, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their h0pe and the hope of their housc, to delay but for a few hovrs that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promjsed tbey would de1iver it; but giving it lo the physician, he thought it better not to harass any rnore the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considored, the ravings of a maniac. Nighl passed on without resl to the busy inmatos of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more ea\u017fily be canceived than de\u017fcrlbed, the notes of busy preparatiori. Morning came, and lhe found of carriages hroke upori his ear. Aubrey grew almost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame tbeir vigilance, lhey gradvally st0lo away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was oul of the room, and in a momcnt found himself inthe apartmenl where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he iinmediately approached, and, taking his arm 6y force, hurried him from the room, spcechless with rage. Whcn on the staircose, Lord Ruthven whjspered in his ear\u2014\"Rcmember your oath, and know, if not my bride t0 day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So soying, he pusbed him towards his atlendantf, who, roused by the old w0mon, had come iri search of him. Aubrey could no loriger sup-\nport hiinself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken cl blood-vessel, ond he was conveyed ta bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was riot present wheri he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemni2ed, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAuhrey's weakness increosed; the effusion of blood produccd \u017fymploms of the neclr approachof death. He desired his sister's guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related composedly whatthe reader ha\u017f pervsed\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hclstened to protect Miss Aubrey; but whcn they arrived, it was t0o late. Lord Ruthuon had disappeared, and Avbrey'f sister had glutted the lhirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecion Archipelago, on board one of his Majefty's vessels, in the year I812, we put lnto the harbovr of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of oattle and vegetablcs always to be had tbere, induce many British vesselsta visit it\u2014bolb men of war and merchantmen; and thovgh it Iics rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bovnties clmpIy repay for tbe deviatioriof a voyage. We laridcd; a\u017f usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the meri were employed in watering, and the purser bargajning for cottle with tho natiucs, the clergyman and myself taok a ramble t0 the caveoalled Homer's School, and other places, where we had been hefore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the lsland four doy\u017f previous to our arrival in his selucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" soid tbe Greek, \"arid would havo taken me with him; bvt I did not chaose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, bul o very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the rjver, belong\u017f to him, and he ha\u017f left an old man in charge of it: he gavoDominick, the wirie-trador, six hundred zechines f0r it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there abaul fourteen months, thaugh riotconstantly; sor he sai1s in hisfelucca very often to the disferent islands.\"\nThis account excited ovr curio\u017fity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to lhe house wbere our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old mori, wh0 conducted us over the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting pclrlour, and a bed-room, witha spac ious clo\u017fot annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain greeri-stained walls, mclrble tab les on either side, a large myrtle in lhe ceritre, and a small fovntain beneoth, which could be made ta play thr0ugh tho branobes by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venvs in a leaning posture; a lclrge couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall st0od half a dozen English cane chairs, and ari empty book-case: there were no mir-\nrors, nor a single paintirig. The bedchamber had merely a la rge mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffedcotton qullts anda pil1ow\u2014the comm0n bed throughout Grcoce. In the silting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, lhe old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were theri in a large seaman's chest iri the closet: it was open, but we didnot think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. On thc tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousscau's works compIete; Volney'sRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German languagc; Klopstook's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Ital-\niari odition, printed at Parma in 1810; severol fmall pamphlets from the Greek press al Constantinople, much torri, but na English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencj1, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and markedwith slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said ho, \"there they must lie until his return; far he is sa particu1ar, that were I to move one lhing without orders, he would frown upon mc for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a servico; and I have lhe produce of lhis farm for the lrouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechlncs which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small ootlage in the wood, and whom the lord brovght here from Adrian0ple; I don't know for what reason.\"\nTheappeararice of tbe house exlernally wos pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces 1ong and f0urteen broad, and the fluted marble pillarf wjth black plintbs and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grocian architecture,) were considerab1y higber than tbe raof. The roof, surrounded by a llght stone balustrade, was couered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strorig coarse linen. Most af the house-tops are thus surnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings jn smoking, drlnkjng light wines, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating fruit, and onjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the houso, a srnalI stroamlet glided away, grapes, orangcs and limes were elustering togetber on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes,a marble seat with an ornainental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" forhe was very devout, \"and always att-\nended our churcb twice a week, bosides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may 6e termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eyc to Mounl Calclo, covered with olive and myrtlc trees jn blooin, and an the summit of which an ancient Greek tempIo appeared in maje\u017ftic decay. A smoll stream issuing from the ruins de\u017fcended in broken oascades, unlil it was lost ln lhe woods near the movntain's base. The sea smooth as glass, arid an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminatos the view in front; and a 1ittle on the left, through a vista of lofty chesriut clnd palm-trees, several small islands were dislinctly observed, \u017ftudding lhe light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoycd a ujew more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitlefs as to the narne of the person who had resided in this romantic solitvde: none knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"couId tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you lell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of tbe isolated lord. He had partioned eighl young girls when be was last upon the island, and even danced with thom at the nuptial seast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and catton arid silk to the girls who live 6y weaving these artioles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, ond be often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, froin all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstanco we learnt,which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. Hc had a most boautiful daughter, witb whom tbe lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was tbe informationwith which we departed from the peaccfvl isle of Mltylene; our imagiricltions all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He hod inoney it wcls evident: ho hod philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricjties wbich mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. FaIling in cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypl and Greece, \"The iridividual,\" said he, \"ahoul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on tbe islclnd of Tenedos, and I also visited him clt Mitylene.\" We bad never then heard of his lordship's same, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized tbe rccluse of CaIcla in everypage. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea 0f returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statcrnent,helievirig it not quite uninteresting, and iri justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to a\u017fsocjating wilh human nature, or contributing in any way to soath its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as may bo plainly gatbered frorn these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in bis lordship's poems, seem to have tbeir scat in his bosom. Tendemess, sympathy, and charity clppear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additj0nal reasori sor marking hiin as a being on whose heart Reljgion hath set her sea1, clnd over wbose head Benevolerice hoth thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as o countryman. With respect to hi\u017f loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reparts are ever to be rec-\neived with cavtion, particuIarly when directed against man's moral integrjty; ond he who dares justify himself before that awful tri6unal where aIl must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of hjs genius. Ta do good in secret, and shun the world's applaus e, is the surest testimony os cl virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","33":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon wbioh this tale is fourided is very general intho East. Among the Arabians it appears lo be common: it did not, howeuer, extend itseIf to the Greeks until after the establishment of Chrislianity; and it has onlyassumed its present form sirice the division of the Lalin and Greek churohes; at which time,the idea beeoming prevalent, thal a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradual1y increased, and formed the subiect of many wondorfvl stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feedjng upon the blood of the yovng and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where the helief existcd, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certairi portion of the blood of thcir victims, who 6ecame emaciated,lost thelr strerigth, and speedily died of con\u017fumplions; whilst these huinan blood-suckers fattened\u2014and theirvoins becarne distended t0 \u017fuch a state of repletion, as to ccluse the b1ood to f1ow from all the passages of their bodjes, and even from the very poros of their skins.\nIn the Londori Journal, of March, 1732, is a evriou s, and, of course, credible occovnt of a particular case of vampyrism, whjch is stated to have occurred at Modreyga, in Hungary. It appears, tbat upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of tho plaee, they positively ond unanimously affirmed, tbat, about sive years before, a certain He yduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a uampyre, 6ut bad found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood.This precaution, h0wover, did not prcvent hlm from bocoming a vainpyro himfelf; sor, about twenty or thirty days after bis death and burial, mony persons cornplained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had beendeprived of Iife by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitclnts having consultedtheir Hadagni, took up the body, and found lt (as is supposed to be usual in coses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from eorruption, and emilting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof havirig been thus obtained, thoy resorted to lhe accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and bady 0f Arnold Paul, at which he is reportcd to hclue cried out as dreadfully as if he had heen alive. This dorie, they cut off his head, burned hjs body, and throw the ashes lnto his grave. The same moasures were adopted with the corses of thoso persons who had previously died from vompyrism, lost they should, in their turn, become agenls upon othcrs who survived thern.\nThe universa1 be1ief if, that a person sucked hy a vampyro becomes a vampyre himsels, and sucks in his lurn.\nChief bailifs.\nThis monstrous rod0montade is berc related, because jt seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than clny olher instonce which could be adduced.In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftor death, for some heinous crime committed wbilsl in existencc, that tbe deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved ino\u017ft while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by tie\u017f of kindred and affection.\u2014A supp0sition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse fhall from its tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughler, sister, wife, At midnight drairi the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforcc Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victim\u017f, ere thoy yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing lhem, Thy flowers are wlthered on lhe stem. But one thclt for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best bel0vod of a1l, Shall bless thee with a fother's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must erid thy task and mclrk Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Whichfreezes o'er its lifeless blue; Thenwith unhallowed hand shall tear The tresscs of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorri Affectiori's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by lhee Memorial of thine og0ny! Yet with thirie own best 6lood shall drip; Thy gnashing toolh, and haggard Iip; Tben stalking to thy sullen grave, Ga\u2014and with Gouls and Afrjts rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey bas also introduced in his wild but beautiful paem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arclbian maid Oneiza,who isrepresented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. Bvt this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocerice. The veracious Tournefort gjues a long account in his travels of seueral astonishing cases af vampyrism, lo which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon thif su6ject, besides a varicty of anecdotes, and tradilionary narralives illustralive of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tendirig to prove lt to be a c1assical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany cvrious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might bc added; though the preserit may suffice for the limits of a nole, necessorlly devoted to exploriation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the orie in mofl general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it,mado use of in variou\u017f parts of tho worI d: as Vroucolocha, Vordoulacha, Gou1, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in tbe midst of thc dissipations altendant upon a L0ndon wiriter, there appeared at the variou\u017f parties of thc leclders of the ton a nob1eman, more remarkable sor his si rigularities, than his rank. Ho gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, tbat he mightby a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Thosc who felt this sensatian of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seom to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; bul fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every h0use; all wished ta see him, and those who had been acoustomed to vialent excitemenl, and now felt the weigbt of ennui, were pleascd at having somethlng in their presence capable of engaging their altentlon. In fpjte of the deadly hue of his face, whioh never gained a warmer tint,either from tbe blush of modesly, or from the strong emo tion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, inariy of the female hunters aftcr notorie ty altempted to wiri his attentions, and gain, clt least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery os every monfter \u017fhewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herse1f in his woy, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though invain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes wcre apparcntly fixed upan her's, still it seemed a\u017f if they were unperceived;\u2014even her vnappalled impudence was bafsled, arid she left the field. But though the comm0n adultress could not influence even the guidance of hjs eyes, it was not tbat the female fex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtvous wjfe and innocent doughter, lhat few knew he ever addressed bimself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wirining torigue; and whether it wcls that it even overcamc the dreod of his singulclr character, or that they were moved by his appclrent hatred of vice, he was as oflen arn ong those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtvos, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same tiine, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Avbrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardiclns, who thoughl il their dvty merely ta tako care of his fortune, wbile they relinquished the more importarit charge of his mind t0 the oare os mercenary subaIterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathi\u017fewith uirtue, and thought that vicc was thrown iri by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thoughl that thc misery os a cottage merely consisted in the ve\u017fting of clothes, which were as warm, bvt which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds clnd various caloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of llfe. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for t hese reasons, upon hif entering into the gay circlos, manymothcrs surroundedhim, strjving which should describe wilh least truth their lariguishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, 6y their brightening countenances when heapproached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him int0 false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance os his salitary hours, he waf startled at finding, that, exoept in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence 0f a ghost, butfrom want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life f0r any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptionscontained in those uolumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was abaut to rclinquish his dreams, when the extraordjriary being we hove above described, crossed him ln his career.\nHe watchcd him; and the very irnpossibility of forming an ideo 0f the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of external obiects, than thetacit assent to their exislence, implied by the avoidonce of thelr contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered lts pr0pensity to extravagant ideas, he \u017foon formed this object into the hero of a romanee, and determined to observe the offspring of hls foricy, rathcr thari the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him alteritions, clnd so for advanced upon his notice, that his presence wos always recognised. He gradualIy learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes af preparation in \u2014 Slreet, that ho was a6out to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respeeting this singvlar character, who, lill now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, whlch for many generatlons hcls been thought necessary lo enable the young to take same rapid steps jn the career of vice towar ds pvttlng themselvos upon an equality with the aged, arid not allowing thom to app ear af if fallen from the \u017fkics, whenever scandalous intrigues are meritioned as tbe subjects of pleasanlry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carryirig them on. They consented: arid Aubrey immedicltely mentioning hi\u017f intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him cl praposal to join him. Flattered by fuch a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladIy aceopted it, and in a few days they had passed tbe circlirig waters.\nHlthcrto, Aubrey had had no opportvnilyof studying Lord Ruthveri'f character, and nowhe found, thal, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, lhe results offered different conclusions from the apparent motiuos to his conducl. His companion was profuse ln hi\u017f liberalily;\u2014the idle, the vaga6ond, and tho beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relievc their immediate wants. But Avbrey could n0l avoid remarklng, thot it was not upon the virtuovs, reduced to indigence by the inissortunes atlendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014tbese were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers;but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to wa1low in his lust, or to fink bim stil1 deeper in his iriiquity, he was sent away witb rjch charity. This wcls, however, attributed by him to the greaterimportunity of the uicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of tbe virtuous indigcnt. There was one circumstance about the char ity of his Lordship, wbich was still more irnpres\u017fed upori his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thal there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns througb which they passed, Auhrey was surprized at the apparent eagernoss with which hif compan ion sought for the centres of all fashionoble vice; there he entcred into all the spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled witb success, except where the known sharper wos his anlagonist,and then he lost even more thon he gained; but it was always with tho same unchanging face, with wbich he generally watched the society around: it wcls not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luck1ess father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune'\u017f law\u2014this apparent abstracledncss of mind wcls laid aside, and his eyes sparkled wlth more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the holf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerIy affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the sollt ude of a dvngcon, the fate that had drawn him withiri the reach of this fjend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst tbe speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to sati ssy their present craving. Yet he taok no money from thc gambling table; but immedlately lost, to tbe ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the oonvulsive gra sp of the innocent: this mjght but be the resull of a certain degree of knowledge, whlch was not, however, copable os coinbating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved tbe ruin os all, and did not tend ta his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hop ed his friend would give bim some opportunity of speclking frankly and openly to hjm; however, this nevcr accurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, clnd amidst the various wild and rich scenes 0s nature, was alwayslhe same: his eye spoke less than hislip; and though Avbrey waf neor the object of hi\u017f curiosity, he obtained no greater gratifioation from it than the coristant excitement of vainly wishing to break thatmystcry, which to his exalted imagination began to assume tbe oppearance of somothing supernatural.\nThey saon arrived at R0me, and Aubrey for a time loft sight os his companiori; he left him in daily attendclnce upon the morriing cirole of an Ilalian countess, whilst he went in search of the meinorials of another alinosl deserted city. Whilst ho was thus erigaged, letters arrived from En gland, which he opened with eager lmpalicnce; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; thc others were from his guardions, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into hi\u017f imaginalion that there was an evil power refident in his companion, these seemcd to give him fufficlent reason for the belies. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urgod, tbat his character was dreadfully viciaus, for that the possession of irresistiblc powers of sedvctian, rendered his ljcentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultresf had not originated in hatred of her charaotor; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victirn, the partner of his guilt, should be hurIed from the pinnocle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that alI those females whom be had sought, apparently on account of their uirtue, had, since his departure, throwri euen the mask aside, and had not scrupIed to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright poirit on which to rc\u017ft the eye. He resolved to jnverit some plausible pretoxt for abandoning him altogether,purpafing, in the mean whilo, to walch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pafs by urinoticed. He entered inta the same clrcle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was cndeavourlng t0 work up0n the inexperience of the daugbter of the lady whose house he chicfly frequented. In Itoly, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in sociely; ho was therefore obliged to carry on hif plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discouered that an assignatlon had been appointed, which wauld most llkely end in lhe rujn of an innocerit, thovgh thougbtless girl. Losing na time, he entered the apartmerit of Lord Ruthven, and abrvptly asked him his intontions with respect to the lcldy, informing him cll the same time lhat hc was aware of his being about to meet her that vory night. Lord Rulhven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed a1l would haue upon such an occasiori; and upon being pressed whether he intendod to mclrry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immedialely writing o note, to say, that from that momenl he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seok other apartments, and calling vpan the mother 0f the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, 6ut also concerning the character of his Lardship. The assignatjon was prevented. Lord Ruthven riext day merely sent hif servclnt to notisy his complete ossent to a separation; bvt did not hjnt any fuspicion of his p1ans having been soiled by Auhrey's interposition.\nHaving lefl Rome, Aubrey directod his steps towardf Greece, and cros\u017fing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed hif residence in the house of o Greek; and soon occupied him\u017felf in tracing the saded records os ancient glory upon monuments that clpparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen anly before \u017flaves, had hidden thernselves beneath the sheltering soil or many colovred ljchen. Under lhe same r0of as himseIf, existed a bcing, so beautiful and dolicate, that she might have formedthe modol for a painter wishing to pourtray on carivass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too muoh mind for any orie to think shc could belong to those who had nosouls. As she danced up0n the plain, or trippod cllong lhe mounlain's fide, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type os her beauties; for who would baue exchanged her eye, clpparently tho eye of animated nature, for tbat sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe aftcri accompanied Avhrey in his search after antiquities, and ostcn would the uriconsciou\u017f girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the oager gaze os hiin, who forgot the lettors he had just decyphcred upon ari almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted oround, exhlbit in thesun's ray svch delieately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excufe tbe f0rgotfulne\u017fs of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thaught of vitalimportance lo thc proper interpretation af a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt t0 describe charms which all seel, but none con appreciato?\u2014It wa\u017f inriocence, youth, ond heauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stjfling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch tbe magic effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance up0n the open plain, would paint, to him in all tho glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning ta svbjects that had evidently madea greoter lrnpression vpon her mind, would le1l him all the supernatural tales 0s her nurse. Her carnestness and apparent belief of what \u017fhe narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told hjm the tale of the living vampyre, wh0 had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his bI0od would run cold, whilst he attemptod to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected orie living among themselves, after several of their neor relatives and children had beon found marked with the stamp os the fiend'sappetite; and when she found him so jncredulous, sbe begged of him to beljeve her, sor it had been, reinarked, lhat thase who had dared to qveftion their exislence, always bad some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaklng, to confess it was true. She detailed to him tbc traditianal appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearirig a pretty accuratc description os Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there cou1d be no truth in her fears, though at tbe same time ho wondered al the many coineidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began ta attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrastod with all lhe asfected virlues of the women among whom he had sought for hi\u017f vision ofromance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of oyoung man of English hablts, mclrrying an unedvcated Greek girl, still ho found himse1f inore and more atlached to the a1most fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for somc antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return untjl his object was attained; but he always found it impossi6le ta fix his attention upon the ruiris around him, whiIst in his mind he retained an image tbat seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was vnconscious of his l ove, and was ever the same srank infantile being he had sirst kriown. She always seemed to part frorn him with reluctance; 6ut it was becaufe she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardicln was occupied jn sketching or uncovering some fragmenl which hod yet escaped the destructive hand of tiine. She had appealed to hor parents on the subject of Vampyre\u017f, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed up0n one of his excursions, which was t0 detain hjm for a few haurs; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once beggedof him not ta return at nlght, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever r emain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They descrlbed it as the re sort of tbe vampyres in thcir noctumal orgies, and den0unced the rnost heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their poth. Aubrey made light of their repre\u017fentations, and tried to lavgh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus ta mock a superior, infernal pawer, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext mornirig Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprlsed to observe the melancholy sace of his host, and wos concerned to find that his word\u017f, mocking the belicf of t hose horrlble fiends, had inspircd them wilh such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ore night allowed the power of these bcings to be put in acti0n;\u2014he promised. He wos, howevor, so occupled in his researcb, that he djd not perceive lhat day-light would saon end,and that in the horizon tbere was 0ne of those specks wbich, iri the warmer climatcf, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon tho devoted counlry.\u2014He at lclst, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: bul it was too late. Twilight, in these southorn climates, is almost vnknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he bad advanced far, tho power of the \u017ftorm wos ahoue\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an intervcl1 of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forccd its woy through the canopying foliage, whilst the hlvc forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very fect. Sudden1y his horse took sright, arid he was carried with dreadfvl rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal clt last, tbrough fatigue, stopped, and he fourid, by the glare af lightning, thal he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brvshwood which furrounded it. Dlsmounting, he approached, hoping to find some 0ne to guide bim to the towri, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storin. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, aIlowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womon mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, contjnued in onc almast unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by lhe thunder wbich again rolIed ovor hls head, he, witb a sudden efforl, sorced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the \u017fovnd, howevor, guided him. He wos apparently unperceived; for, though he colled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found hirnself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud lavgh fucceeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seomed superhuman: determined to seI1 hi\u017f life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: be was lifted fr0m hjs foet and hurled with enormous force against theground:\u2014his cnemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon bis throat\u2014when lbe glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instaritly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl inomenl the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, wcls no longer heard. The storm waf now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon beard by those without. They entered; tbc light of their lorches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every iridividual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searcbed for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again Ieft in dclrknesf; but what was his horror, wheri tbe light of the torches once moro burst upon him, lo perceive the airy form of his fair conduclress hroughtiri a lifeless corse. He shvl hisoyes, hopirig tbal it was but a vision clrising from his di\u017fturbed imagination; but he again saw lhc same form, when he unclosed them, slretched by bis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan her lip; yet there was a ftillness about her face that \u017feemed aImost as attaching as the lise that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neek and breast was blood, ond upon her thraat were the marks of teeth having opencd the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! o Vampyre!\" A litter was qvickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to bim the object of so many bright and sajry visions, now fallen with lhe flower os life that had died within her. He knew not what his tboughts wero\u2014his mind was benum6ed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held aImost unconsciously in his hand a naked dclgger os a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by disferent parties wbo had boen engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the pclrents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe theirgrief would be impossible; bvt when they ascertained the cause of their child'f death, tbey looked at Aubrey, and pointod tothe cor\u017fe. They were incon solclble; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violenl fever, and was often deliriou s; in lhesc inlervals he would call upon Lord Ruthvenand up0n Ianthe\u20146y some unaccountable combinolion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the heing he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever moljve, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrifiod and startled at the sight of him whose image he had nowcombined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, hy his kirid words, implying almostrepentance for the fault that had causod their separatjon, and stlll more by the atlention, anxiety, and eare which he showed, soon reconcilod him lo hjs presence. His lordsbip seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared thclt apothetic being wh0 had so ostonished Aubrey; but as saon as his oanvaloscence began to be rapid, he again gradually rctired into thc same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised t0 meet his gaze fixed inleritly upon him, with a smile of maliciovs exultation playing upon his ljps: he knew not why, but this smile havnted him. During the lclst stage of the invalid's recouery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wavef raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, llke our world, the moveless sun;\u2014irideed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by tbis shock, wos mvch weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had oncc so distinguishod him now seemed to have fled for euer. He was now as much o lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in lhe neighbourhood of Athons; if hesought it amidst the ruinsho had formerly frcquented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woads, her light step would appear wandering amidstthe underwood, in quest os the modost violet; lhen suddenly turnjng round, would show, t0 his wild imagination, her palc face and wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, euery feature of which crealed such bltler associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbuen, lo whom be held hlmself bound by the tendor care he hcld taken of him duririg his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yot seen. They travelled in every direclion, and sought every spot lo which a reeollection c0uldbe attached: but though they thus haslened from p1ace t0place, yet they seemed nol to heed what they gazed upon. They hoard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the inventiori of individuals, wbose intereft it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecling the advice of the inhabitants, on orie occa\u017fion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than cls a defence. Upon entoring, however, a narrow defi1e, at the botlom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they hadreason to repent their negligerico; for scarcely were thewhole of the party ongaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the wbistling of bullets c1ofe to their heads, arid by the cchocd report of several gvns. Iri an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind r0cks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating thelr example, retired for a moment behind tbe shelterjng turn of lhe defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shauts bade thcm advance, arid being exposed to unresjsting flaughter, if any 0f the r0bbers should c1imb above and toke tbem in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad tbey lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven receiued a shol in tbe shouldor, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was foon surprised by seeing the robbers' faccs arourid him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immedialely thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises os great rew-\nard, Aubrey soon induced them to conuey hls wourided friond lo a neighhouring eclhin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thoir presence\u2014thcy being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return witb tho promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvcn's strength rapidly decreased; iri two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conducl arid appearance had not changed; hc seemed as uncorifcious of pain as he hod been of the objects about him: but towards the ol ose of tho last evening, his mind became appclrently uncasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offor his assjstanco with more than usuaI earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may fave me\u2014you may do moro than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of rny exlstence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save iny h0nour, yaur friend's honaur.\"\u2014\"How? tellrne how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014bvl if you wou ld conceal a1l you know of me, my honour werc free from stain in lhe world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisirig himself with exultant violenee, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, byaIl your naturc fears, swear that, fora year arid a day you will not impart y0ur kn0wledge of my crimes or death to any living being in ony way, whatever may happen, or whatever you moy \u017fee. \"\u2014His eyes seemed hur\u017fting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathod no mare.\nAubrey retired to rost, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his ocquaintance with this man rose upori his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oclth a cold sbivering came over him, os if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the rnorning, he was abaut lo enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, arid informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and oomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbovring mount, according to a promise they had gjven hls lordship, that it shauld bc exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after bis death. Avbrey astonished, andtaking soveral of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit ho found ria trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though tbo robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which lhey had laid the body. For a time bis mind was bewildered jn oorijcctures, but be at lasl returned, convinced that thoy had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to beighten that superstitious melancholy that had sejzed upon bis min d, he resolved to leaveit, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whlle waiting for cl vessel to c0nvey hirn to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himsels iri arranging those effccts he hcld with him belonging to Lard Rvthven. Ainongst other thlngs there waf a case coritaini ng several weclpons of offence,more or less adopted to ensure the doath of the victim. There were several daggers and atagharis. Whilst turning them ouer, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sbeath appareritly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fat al hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastoning to gain further proos, ho found the weclpan, and his horror may be imagined wben he dlscovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held jn his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splondour on both, and left no rooin sor dou6t; tbere were alsa drops of bloodon each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on hjs way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their forturie ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almo\u017ft broken under so many repeatcd horrars; he was afraid thatthis lady had fal1en a victim tothe destroyer of Iantho. He bocame inorose and silent; and his onIy oecupatiori consisted ln urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the liso of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seomed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the rnansion of his fathers, and thore, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri the embracos and caresses of his sister, aIl memory os the past. If sbe before, by her infantine carefses, had gained his affoction, now that lhe woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as acoinpanion.\nMiss Auhrey had not that winning grace wbich gains the ga2e and applcluse of the drawing-roorn assemblics. There was none of that light brilliancy which orily exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by tho levity of the mind beneath. Thore was a melancholy charm about lt which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some fee1ing within, that appeared to indicate a soulconscious of a brighter recllm. Her step was not that ljght footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or o colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pcnsive. When alonc, her sace was never brigbtened by the smile of joy; but when hcr brother breatbed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs sbe knew destroyed his rest, wha would have exchanged her smile for that of tbe voluptuary? It seemed as iftho\u017fe eyes,\u2014that faoe were then playing in tbc light of their own native sphere. Shc was yot only eighteen, and had not bcen presented to the world, it bauing been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should he delayed until her hrother's retvrn from the coritinent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therofore, reso1vod that the noxt drawing-room, whjch was fast opproaching, should be the epoch os her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Au6r ey would rather have remained in lhe mansion ofhis fathers, and fed upon the mclancboly which ouerpowered hlin. He could not feel interest a6out the frivolities offashionable \u017ftrangcrs, when his mind had bcen so tornby the events he had witnessed; hvt he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They foon arrived in lown, and prepared for the next day, which had 6een announced a\u017f a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was exeesfive\u2014a drawing-ro0m had not been held for a long time, arid all who were anxious to bosk in the smllo of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he wos standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engagod in the rememhrance that the first timo he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that uery place\u2014he felt himsclf suddenly sei2ed by the arrn, and a voice he recognized too well, \u017founded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turri, foarful of seeing a spectre thclt wovld blast him, when be perceived, at cl little distance, the same figure which had attracted hjs notice on this spot upan his first entry into \u017fociety. Ho gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, arid was driven home. He paced tbe room with hurried steps, and fi xed his hands upon bis heod, as if he were afraid his thovghts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014cjrcumstances started up in dreadfularray\u2014the dagger\u2014bis oath.\u2014He raused himseIf, ho could not bclieve it possible\u2014the dead rise agajn!\u2014He thought his imaginalion had conj-\nured vp the image his mind was resllng upon. It was imp0ssible that it could be real\u2014he determinod, therefore, to go again into society; for though he allempted t0 ask eoncerning Lord Ruthven, the riame hvng upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining lnformation. He went cl few nights ofter wilh his sister to the assembly of a near relatiori. Leaving her under the proteotion of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceivirig, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversalion; hc attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, tumed round, and rcvealed ta him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried ftep, f0rced her towards the \u017ftreet: at the d0or he fourid himself impeded by the crowd of servants wbo were waiting for thoir lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did nat dare to turn, but, hurryirig his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before hif mind had heen absorbed by one subject, how much morecompletely was lt engrosso d, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his tboughts. His sister's attenlions were now unheeded, clnd it was in vairi thclt she intreated him to exploin to her wbat had causod hif abrupt conduct. Ho only uttered a few words, and thase terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oatb startled him;\u2014was he then to allow thif monstor to raam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all be beld deor, and not avert its progress? His very sister might bavc been touched by him. But even if he werc to break his oath, and disclose his suspiclons, who would believe him? He thought of employing hls own hand to free the world from svch a wretch; but death, he remembered, had beeri already mocked. For days he remained in lhis state; shut up in his room, hc saw no one, and clte only when his sist or come, wha, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, f0r her sake, to support nature. At last, no langer capable of bearing stil1ncss and solitude, he loft his house, roamed fr0m strect t0 street, anxious to fly that image which haurited him. His dress became neglected, and he waridered, as often exposed to the naon-day sun as to the midnigbt damps. He was no longer to be rec0gnized; at fjrst he returned with the euening to lhe house; but at last he laid him dawn to rest wherever fatjgue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to f0llow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled frorn a pursuer swifter thcln any\u2014from thought. His coriduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that he Ieft by his absence lhe whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of w hose prcsence they were unconscious, he determined lo enter again into soclely, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, jn spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when be entcred into a room, his haggard and svspicious looks were so slriking, his inward shudderings so visible,that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected hjm so strorigly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardian\u017f thought praper to interposc, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alleriated, they thovght it high time to resume clgain that trvst which had beon besore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving bim from the injuriesand sufferings be had daily ericountered in hls wanderings, and of preuenting him from expasing to the gerieral eye tho\u017fe marks of what they considered folly, thoy engaged a physician to resjde in the house, and take constarit care of hiin. He hardly appeored to noticc it, so compIetely was his mjnd ab\u017forbed by one terrible subject. Hi\u017f incoherence becclme at last so great, that ho was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attaineda glassy Iustre;\u2014the orily sign of affection and recolIoction remaining displayed itself upon the entry of bis sister; then he would sometimes \u017ftart, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely affIicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer waf, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, wbencc not even she could rouse him. This lastcd many months: gradually, however, af the ycar was passing, his incoherences became lefs frequent, and bis mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardions observed, that severa1 times in the day he wovld count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smiIe.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering hi\u017f room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being ln so awful o sltuation, when his sister was going next dayto be married. Instant1y Aubrey's attentian was attraoted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelIcct, of which they feared he had been deprived, they montioned thc name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking tbis was a young Earl whom he hcld met with in society, Aubrey seemed plea\u017fed, and astonished them slill more by his expressing his intention to be present at tbe nuptials, arid desiring to sec his sister. They answered not, but in a fow minutes his si ster was with him. He was apparentIy again capable os being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and klssed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the lhought of her brother's being once more aljve to the feelingf of affection. He began to speak wilh all his wonted warmth, and to oongratulate ber upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly percejved a locket upon her breast; 0pening it, what waf his surprise at beholding the feature\u017f of thc monster who bod so long influeneed his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why be thus destrayed the resemblance of her future husbclnd, he looked cls if he did riot undcrstand her\u2014theri seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantie expre\u017fsion of countenance, he bade hcr swear that she would nevcr wed this monster, for he\u2014 But hc could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remeinber his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In tbe mearitime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, clnd tbought thif was but a return of his disorder, entered, arid for cing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leclve him. He fell upon hls knees to tbem, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributlng this to the insonity they imagined had taken possession of hi\u017f mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had eallod the morning after the drawing-room,and had bcen refused with evory one else. When be heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily undorstood himselfto be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, hi\u017f exultation and pleasurc could hardly be conceclled from those among whom he had gained lhis information. He hastoned to the housc of hls former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence os great affection for lhe brother and interest in his sate, hc gradually won lhc ear of Miss Aubrey. Who eould resist his power? His tongue had dangers ond toils to recount\u2014couldspeak as himself as os an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save wilh herto wham he addressed himse1s;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his cxistence, had begun to seem worthy of prescrvation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014jn fine, he knew fo well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at lengtb to him, he obtained an importclnt embassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take plclce the very day bofore hi\u017fdeparture for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the pbysjcian and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; il was given him; he wrote a letter to hjs fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now ln the grave, who orice held her in their arms as their bope and the bope of their h0use, to delay but fora few hours thal marrlage, on which ho denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver jt; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better nol to harass any more the mind of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pasfed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concejved than described, the notes of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the found of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigllance, they gradually stole away, leaving him iri the custody of an helpless old woman. He soized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment sourid himself in the apclrtment wherc all were nearly assemblcd. L0rd Ruthven was the first to pcrceive him: he immediotely appraached, and, laking his arm by sorce, hurried him srom the room, speechlc\u017fs with rage. When on the stairca\u017fe, Lord Rutbvcn whispcred in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendclnts, wbo, roused by the old woman, had come in fearch of him. Aubrey could n0 longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had brokena blood-uossel, arid he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioncd to bis sister, who was not present when hc entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was soIem-\nnized, and lhe bride and bridegroom left L0ndon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusjon of blood produced symploms of the riear approach of death. He desired hif sister's guardians might be called, arid when the midnight hour had strvck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians hastcned to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it wcls loo late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's slster had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all bef ore him, where to choose hif place os rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through tbe Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18l2, we pvt inlo the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this placc, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always t0 be had there, induce many British vossels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; arid though it lies rathor out of the lrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountief ainply repay for the deviation of cl voyage. We landed; as u\u017fual, at the boltom of the bcly, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ido (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Sclo with an English lard, wbo left the ifland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have takon ine with him; but I djd not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the rivor, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (obout L250 Eng1ish currency,) and has resided there about fourteenmontbs, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different iflands.\"\nThis occount exci ted our curiosity very much,and welost no time in hastening to the bouse whero our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an eritranco hall,a drawing-room, a sitling parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet onnexed. They were all sirnply dec0rated: pIclin green-stained walls, mar ble tables on either sido, a largc myrtle iri the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which covld be made t0 play through the branches by maving a spring fixed in lhe side of a sinall bronzo Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: thore were na mirrors, nora single painting. The bedcbamber had merely a large mattress spread an the flo0r, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common hed lhroughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled wjth books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's cbest in the clo\u017fet: il was operi, but we did nol think ourselves justisied in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerinan, iri the Germanlanguage; Klopstock'f Messiah; Kotzebue's novel\u017f; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; severaI fmall pamphlets from tbe Greek pres\u017f at Constanlin0ple, much tom, but no English boak of any description. Most os these b0oks were silled with margirial noles, written with a penci1, in Italian and Latin. The Messiab was literally scribbled all over, clnd marked wilh slips of paper, on whioh also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading thcse books the evenjng bofore he sailed, and forgol to place them with the others; but,\" \u017faid he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he isso particular, that were I to move ane thing without orders, he would frown upon me for o week logether; he is otherways very good. I once did hjm a service; and I have the produce of thisfarm for the trouble of taking care of it, excepl twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a smal1 cottogc in the wood, and whom thc lord brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for wbat reason.\"\nThe appearanceof the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornice\u017f, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerahIy higher than the ro0s. The roof, surrovnded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong eoarse linen. Most of tbe house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them tho Greeks pass their evenirigs in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"1achryma christi,\" eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustering together on its barders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe seat with an ornamentaI wooden back was placed, an whjch we were told, the l0rd passed mariy of his evenings andnjghts till twelve o'clock, rcading, writing, and talking lo himself. \"I suppose,\" soid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and alwayf attended 0ur churcb twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew froin this seat waf what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, eovered with 0live and myrtle trecs in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greok temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost iri the woods near tbe mountain's base. The sea smooth as gloss, and ari h0rizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiriatef the vjew in front; and a little on lhe left, througb a vista of lofty chefnut and palm-lrees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the ligbt blue wave with spots of emeraId green. I seldom erijoyed a view more than I did this; hut our enquiries were fruitless as ta the name of the person who had resided in this romantic salitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeniari,\" faid our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he willnot,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time t0 visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolatod lord. He had porlioncd eight young gir1s when he was last vpon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial seast. He gave o cow to one man, horses to ather\u017f, and cot ton and \u017filk to the girlswho live by weaving tbese articles.He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In sb0rl, be appearedto u\u017f, from all we collected, to hclve been a uery eccentric and benevole nt character. One circumstance we learnt, which ovr old friend at the oottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beauliful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on lhe sea-shore, and be had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch waf the information with whicb we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philantbropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genjus. Arrlved at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architcot, a pupll of WYATT'S, who had been travelling ln Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sajd he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travols on the i\u017flarid of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had neuer then be ard of bis lordship's fame, as we had been some yeors from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognizod the recluse os Calclcl in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more ourious in our researcbes at the cottage, bul we cansoled ourseIves with the idea of retvrning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day wjll never retur n. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in jvstice to his lordship's good naine, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of ari unfeeling dispositiori, averse to assooiating with buinan riature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add lo its pleasvres. The fact is directly thereverse, as may be plainly gathered from thcso llttle anecdotes. All the finer feeljngs of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship'\u017f poems, seemto have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courtirig the repose of solitude is an additional roas0n for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion halh sel her soal, and over whose bead Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man oan read thc preceding pleclsing \"traits\" without feel-\ning proud of him as a oountryman. With rospcct to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be receiued with eaution, particularly when directed against mon's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself besore lhat awfultribunal where all must appear, alone may cen\u017fure the errors ofa fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's cbaraeter if worthy of his genius. To do good in \u017fecret, arid sbun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","34":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is sourided is uery general jn the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend it\u017fels to the Greeks until after the establisbment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present sorm since thc divisjon of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea becaming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if burjed in lheir territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject os many woridersul stories, still extant, of thc dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and 6eautiful. In the West it spread, with soineslight variati0n, alI overHungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where lhe belief existed, that vompyres nightly imbibeda cortain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and specdily died of consumptions; whilst lhese human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to suoh a state of repletion, as to cavfe the blood ta flow from all the passclges os their bodies, and even from the vcry pores of thelr skins.\nIri the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of covrse, credible account of a partlcular case os uampyrism, wbich is slated to hclve occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examinotion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pofitivcly and unanimously affirmod, lhat, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, hod bcen heord to say, that, at Cossovja, ori the srontiers of tbc Turkish Servia, he bad been tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himself of the evil, hy eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from 6ecoming a vampyre himfelf; for, a6out twenty or thirty dayf after his doath and burial, many persons complained ofhauirig becn tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four pers0ns bad been depriued of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the hody, clnd found it (as issupposed to be usuaI in cases of vampyrism) fresh, clnd entirely free from corruption, and emitting al tbo inouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorled to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the boart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried aut as dreadfully as if he had been a1ive. This done, they cut off his bead, burned hjs bady, and threw lhe ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with tbe corses of those personf who had previovsly died from vampyrism, left they should, in their tum, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe uni-\nversal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre beeomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThjs monstrous rodomontode is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the presenl observalions than any other instance which could be adduced. Iri many ports of Greece it is considered as a sort 0f punishment after dealh, for soine heinous crime comrnitted whilst in existenee, that tbe deceased is not only doomed to vampyri\u017fe, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, cls Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy raee; There srom thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must fced thy livid l ivirig corsc, Tby victims, ere they yet expire, Shal1 know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, Thc youngest, best beloued of all, Shall blefs lhee with a father'sname\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in fIame! Yet thov must end thy task and mark Her cbeek'slast linge\u2014her eye's 1ast spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless bluo; Then with un halIowed hand shall tear The tresses of her y ellow hair, Of which, in lifo a lock when sborn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away 6y thee Memorial of thine agony! Yel with thine owri best blood shall drip; Thy gnafhing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shririk away From spectre more accursed than thcy.\nMr. Southoy has also introduced in his wild bvt beauliful poem of \"Tha1aba,\" the vampyrecorse of tho Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented os having returned fram the grave for the pvrpose of tormenting him she bcst loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be svpposed to have resultod from the \u017finfulness of her 1ife, she being pourtrayed throughout the whoIe of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenee. The veracious Tovrnefort gjves a Iong account inhis travels of several astonlshirig cases of vampyrism, to which ho pretends to have been an eyewitne\u017fs; and Calmet, in his great work up0n tbis subject, besides a variety os anecd0tes, and traditionary narratives illuftrative of ils effects, bas put forth some learned dissertotions, tending to prove lt to be a classical, as well asbarbarian error.\nMany curiovs and interefting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be cldded; though the present may suffice for the limits os a note, necessarily devoted to explanatjon, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that thovgh tbe term Vampyrejs the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made usc of in various parts of tho world: cls Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst os lhe dissjpations attendant vpon a London winler, the re appeared at the various parties of tho leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as jf he covld not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted hif attention, that he inighl by a look quell il, and throw fear into th ose breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Th0se who folt thi\u017f sensatian of awe, cou1d not explain whence it aro\u017fe: some altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flxing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pieree lhraugh to the inward workirigs of the heart; 6ut fell upon the check with o leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him ta be invited to every house; clll wisbed to fee him, and those who hod been aecustomed to violenl excitement, and now felt the weight of erinui, were pleased at having something in their presence copable of eng aging their attentiori. In spite os the deadly hue of his faee, which nevor gairied a warmer tint, eitber from lho blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passlon, though it\u017f form clrid outline wero beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at leost, \u017fome marks of what they might term affcction: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of everymonsler shewn in drawing-rooms since her rnarrioge, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mounlebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in ualn:\u2014when she stood before bim, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left tho field. But th0ugb the common adultress could not inflvence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not tbat the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he sp0ke to the virtuous wife arid innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addresfed bimsolf to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and whetber lt was that it even overeame the dread of bis singulor character, ar that lhey were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among t hosc femoles who form the boast of thcir sex from thelr domestic uirtues, as among those wh0 sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gen tleman of the nome of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great weallh, by parents who diod while he was yet in childh0ad. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it thoir duty merely to toke care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important cbarge af his mind to tbe care of mercenary subaltems, be cultivated more his imagination than his judgmenl. He had, hence, thal higb romantic feeling of honour and candour, whioh daily ruins so many milliners' apprenticcs. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought lbat vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the pictvresque effect of the scenc, as we see in romances: he thought thclt the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but whlch were better adapted to the palriter's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, ln fine, that the dreams of poets were the reallties of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for thefe reasons, vpon his entering into the gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least trulh their languishing or romping favouritcs: lhe doughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he clpproachcd, and by their spclrkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talentf and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the ta1low and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, bul srom want of snuffing, there was n0 fovndation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasingpictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, fromwhich he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanit y, he was abovt to relinqvish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe wotched him; and the very impossihillty of forming an idea of the character of a man cntirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit asscnt to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: clllowing hif imagination to picture every thing that flattered its proponsity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offfpring of his fclncy, rather tban the person before him. He becameacquainted with hlm, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upan his notice, that his presence wa\u017f always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven'\u017f afsairf were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notos of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about t0 travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, til1 now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiclris, that it was tiine for him to perform the tour, wbich for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps jn the career of vice towclrds putting themselvos upori an equality with lhe oged, and not allowing lhem to appear as if fallen from the sklef, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjecls of pleasantry or os praise, according ta the degreo of skill shewn in carrying thern on. They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions t0 Lord Ruthven, was surprised to reocive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of csteem from him, who, appareritly, had nothirig in common wjth other mcn, he gladIy accepted it, and ina few days they hod passedthe circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had hadno opportunity of stvdyirig Lord Ruthven's character, and now be found, that, tbough many more of his actions were exposed t0 hisview, tbe refults offered different conclusions from the appclrent motives la his conducl. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, roceived from hls hand more than enough t0 relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could riot avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduoed to indigence by the mlffortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beslowed his almf;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed fnoers; but whon the profligate oomc to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or lo sink him still deepcr in his iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. This was, h0wever, attributed by him to the greater iinportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashsvlness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of hi\u017f Lordship, which was stlll more impressed upori his mind: all lhose upon whom it was best0wed, inevitably fourid that there was a curse upon it, sor they were all either lcd t0 the scaffold,or sunk to the lowest and the most abiect misery. At Brussels and oth er towns through which they passed, Aubreywas surprized at tbc apparent eagerness with which hjs companion sought for the centres ofall fashlonable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: hc betted, and always gambled with success, except where tho known sharper was his antagonisl, and then he lost evon more than he gclined; but it was always wlth the \u017fame unchangjng face, with which he generally watched the fociety arourid: it wos not, however, so when he encauntered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fother of a numerous family; theri his very wish scemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent obstraotedness of mind was 1aid aside, and his eyef sparkled wlth more fire than that of the cat whilst dclllying with tbe half-decld mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, lom from the cjrcle he adorned, cursing, in the s0litude of a dungeon, the fate lhat had drawn him within tho rcach of this fi end; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his 1ate immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present crauing.Yet he took no money from the gambling table; bul immediately lost, to the ruiner of rnany, the last gilder he had juft snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this m ight bul be the refult of a certain degree of know1edge, which was not, howevcr, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his srierid, and beg him to resjgn that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profjt;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some op portunity of speaklng frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, waf always the same: his eye spoke lefs than hi\u017f lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosily, he obtained no grealer gratification from it lhan tho constclnt excitement of val nly wi\u017fhing to break that mystery, which to his exa1ted imagination began to assume the clppearance of something supernatural.\nTbey soon arrivod at Rame, and Aubrcy for a time last sight of his cornpclnion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italiari countess, whilst be went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst he waf thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened wilh eager impatience; the first was froin his sister, breathirig nothing hut affection; the others were from hjs guardians, the latter astonjshed him; if it had before entercd into his jmagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him susficient reason for the belief. Hif guardlans insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend,and urged, tbal his cbaracter was drcadfulIy vicious, for that the possessjon of irresistlble powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous t0 soei-\nety. It had been di\u017fcovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred os her character; but thclt he had required,to enhclnce his gratification, that his vielim, the partner of his gvilt, \u017fhould be burled from lhe pinriaele of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest a6yss of infamy and degradation: in sirie, that oll those females whom he had sought, apparerilly on account of their uirlue, hcld, since his departure, thrown even the ma\u017fk aside, and had not scrupled to expose thc whole deformity of thoir vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determinedupon Ieaving one, whose choraoter had not yet showri a single bright pojrit on whlch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plauslble pretext for abandoning him altogelher, purposing, in the mean wbile, to watch him more closely, and to let no sligbt circumstonoes pcl\u017fsby unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeav0uring to work upon the inexperience os the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldomthat an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged tocarry on his plans in secrel; but Avbrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered thot an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the rvin of an innocent, thougb thoughtless girl. L0sing no tiine, he entered the apartmenl of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the sainc time that he waf aware of his being abo ut to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon suoh an occasion; and vpon being pres\u017fed whother he intendod to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing o not e, to say, that from lhat m oment he must decljne accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed to ur, he ordered hls servant to soek ather opartments, and ealling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughtcr, bvt also concerning the character of his Lordsbip. Tbe assignalion was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day mereIy sent his servant to notify his camplete assent to a separalion; but did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been fojled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, \u017foon sound himself at Athens. He then fixed his rosidence in the house of a Greck; ond saon 0ccupied himself in tracing tbe faded reeordf of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only bofore s1aves, had hidden themselves beneath the shellering soil or many coloured liehen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so heautiful and de1icate, tbot she might have formed thc model for cl painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of tbe faithful in Mahomet's poradise, save that hcr eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's fide, one wouId have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have excbanged her eye, apparently thc eye of animatcd nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of lhe animal suited bul to the taste of an epicure. The llght step of Ianthe osten accompaniedAubrey in his search aster antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty ofber form, floatlng as jt were upon tho wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an almost effaced tahlet, in the contemplation of ber sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray sucb delicatcly briIliant and swlftly fading hues, it might well excvse the forgelfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind tbe very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why atlempt to describe charms which all feel, but rione can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilft he drew those remains 0f whieh he wished to preserve a inemorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his penci1, in tracing lhe scenes of her native place; she wovld then describe to him the circllng dance upon the open plain, wouId paint, to him in all the glowing co1ovrs of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjocts thal hcld cvidently made a greater impressjon upon ber mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and appclrent be1ief af what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; clnd often as she told him the tale of the liuing vampyre, who had pas\u017fed years amidst his friends, and deorcst ties, sorced every year, by seeding upon the life os a lovely semale ta prolorig his existence for tbe enfuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to bim the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found markod with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of hjm to believe her, for it hcld been, remarked, that those who bad dared to question their existcnce, always had some proof giveri, which o6liged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of tbefe monsters, ond his horror was increased, by hearlng a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuadirig her, lhat there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a be1ief in tbe supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey bogan to attacb himsclf more and more to Ianthe; her irinocence, f0 contrasted with all the afsecled virtues of the women omong whom he had sought sor his vision af romance, won his heart; and while he rjdiculed the idea of a young man of Englisb habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attaehed to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiqvarian research, he w0uId depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; hut he always found it impossi6le t0 fix his attentiori upon thc ruins around bim, whilst in his mind he retained an image tbat seemed alone the rightsulpossefsor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious 0f his love, and was ever the same frarik infantile bejng be had first kriown. She always seemed lo pclrt from him with reluctance; hut it was because she had no longer clny one with whoin she couId visit her favourito haunts, whilst her guardjan was occupjed iri sketching or uncovering some fragmenl which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed t0 her parenls on the fubject af Vampyre\u017f, and they hoth, with severcl1 present, afflrmed thcir existence, pale with h0rror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excur\u017fions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they hoard lhe name of lhe place, they all at once begged of him not to retum at night, as he must necessarily pass through a woad, where no Greek would ever remain, after tho day had closed, upon anyconsideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the inost heavy ovils as irnpending upon him who dared to cross thelr path. Avbrey made light of thcir represenlations, and tried to lovgh them out os the ide a; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thvs to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrcy set off upon his excursion unattended; be was surprised to observe the rnelancholy face of hi\u017f host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible siends, had inspired thcm wilb such lerror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe oame to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to roturn, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his researeh, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in the warmer climates, fo rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted eountry.\u2014He at last, however, mounled his horse, determined to make upby speed for his delay: but jt was too late. Twilight, in thesesouthern climates, is almasl unkn0wn; immediately the sun sets, night begins: andere he had odvanced far, the powor of lbe st0rm was aboue\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an lnterval ofrest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its waythrough the canopying foliage, whilst tbe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate clt his very feet. Suddenly his horse look fright, and he was corried with dreadfvl ropidity through the entangled forest. The anjmcll at 1ast, thr0ugh fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of li ghtning, that he was in the neighbourhoodof a hovel that hardly liftod itself up from lhe masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping t0 find some ono to guide hlm to thc towri, or at leclst trustjng to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thvriders, for a moment silent, allowed him to heclr the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exu1tant mockeryof a lough, continuod in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by tho thunder which again rollcd ouer hif head, he, with a svdden effort, forced open the doar of the hut. He fourid himself in utter darkness: the sound, howover, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for,though he called, still the sounds continved, and no notice was taken of him. He found hirnself incontaet with fome one, whoin he immcdiately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh svcceeded; and be felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: deterinined to sell his life as deorly as he could, he slruggled; bvt it waf in vain: he was lifted from hls feet and hurled with enormous force clgainst the ground:\u2014his enemy threw bjmself upon hirn, and kneeling upon his broast, had placed his hands up0n his throat\u2014when the glare of mclny lorches penetrating through the hole that gave ligbtin the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly ro\u017fe, clnd, leaving hjs prey, rusbed through the door, and in a momenl the crashing of the brancbes, as be broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapablo os moving, was soon hea rd by those without. They eritered; the light of thejr tarches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual \u017ftraw with heavy flakes of sool. At the desire of Aubroy they searched f0r her who had attracted him by her ories; he was again left in darkness; but what was hls horror, whon the light os the t0rches once more burst upon him, to percejve the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless c0rse. He shul his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from bis disturbed iinagination; but he again saw the same form, when he vnclosed lhem, stretched by his side. Th ere wcls no colour upori ber cheek, not even upan her lip; yet thore wasa stil1ne\u017fs aboul her face that seemed almost as attaching as thc life tbat once dweIt there:\u2014upon her neok and breast was blood, and upon her throat werc the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneouslyslruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A 1itter was qujckly forined, and Aubrey waf laid by tho side of her who bad 1ately been to him the object of so mariy brigbt and sairy vlsions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mirid was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, clnd take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a riaked dagger 0f a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had beeri engaged in the search 0f her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, sorewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe lheir grief would be imposslble; bul when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the carse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wlth a moft violent fever, and was often delirious; in these iritervals he would caIl upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by soine unclccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former eompanion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon bis head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chancedat this time to arrive at Athenf, and, from whatever motive, upon bearirig of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constont attendont. When the latter recovered from bis delirlum, he was horrified and startled at thc sight of him whoso image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentclnce for the fault that had caused their separatiori, and still more by tbe attention, anxiety, clnd care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemedquile chariged; he no longer appeared thal apathelic being who had soastonished Aubrey; but af soon as his eonvalescerice bcgan to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same stclte of mind, and Avbrey perceiued no difference from lhe former man, except that at times he was surprised to meot his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malieiousexultation playing upon his lip\u017f: he kncw riot why, hut this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Rulbven was apparently engaged in watching the tidelesf waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri mclrking the progress of th0se orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the maveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish t0 avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by thi\u017f shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distiriguished him now seemed to have fled far euer.He waf now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rvthven; bvt much as he wisbed for solitude, his mind c0uld not sind it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he saught it amjdst thc ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form slood by his side\u2014if he foughl it in the woods, her light stop wauld appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would fhow, to his wild imagination, her pale face arid wounded throat, with a meek smile upon ber lips. He determinod to fIy scenes, every seature of which created such bjtter associations in his mind. He propased to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him\u017felf bound by the tcnder care he had taken of himduring his illness, that they shovld vi\u017fit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They trauelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollcclion could be attacbed: but though they thus h a\u017ftened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what lhey gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excjte the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabilanls, on orie occasion they travellcd with only a few guards,more to serve as guides than os a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the 6ottom of whjch was the bed of a torrenl, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring preciplces, thcy had reasori lo repent their negligonce; for scarcely were the wbole of the party engaged in the nclrrow pass, when lhey were startled by the whistling af bvllet\u017f close to their heads, and by the echoed report of \u017fcverol guns. In an instant their guards had left them, arid, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in lhe direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, lmitatlng their examp1e, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defil e: but ashamed of beirig thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade lhem advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they deterinlried at once to rufh forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they losl the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot iri the shoulder, which 6rought him to the ground. Aubreyhastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the cantest or his own peril, was soon surpriscd by seeing the robbers' face\u017f around him\u2014his guards having, vpon Lord Rvthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wouri ded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and havjng agreed upori a ransom, he wcls no more distvrbed by their presence\u2014they being coritent merely to guard the entrance till tbeir comrade shauld return with lhe promised sum, sor which he hadan ordcr. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreosed; in twodays martification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty slcps. His conduct and appearanco had not changed; he seemed as unconscious af pain as he had been 0f the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind becamo apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, whowas indvced to offer his as\u017fistance with more than vsual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save mc\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I moan not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but yov may save my honour, your friend's honavr.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I carinat explain thc whole\u2014but if y0u would conceal all yov know of me, my honour were free from stain in the war1d's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014butlife.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried thodylng man, raising him\u017folf with exultant violence, \"Swear by all yovr soul reveres, by clll yaur nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you wi1l not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death lo any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their fockots: \"I swear!\" sald Aubrey; he sunk laughing up0n his pilIow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest,but did not sleep; the many circumstances atlending his acquaintance wjth this man rose upon his mind,and he knew not why; when he rememberod bis oath a cold shivering camo over him, as if from the presentiment of something horribIe awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about lo enter the hovel in which he had lcft the corpse, when a robber met him, and iriformed him that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a nejghbouring mount, aceording to a promlse they had given his lordship, that il should he exposed to the first cold ray of tho moon that r0se aftcr his doath. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it Iay. But, when he had mounted to the summil he faurid no traoe of either tbe carpfe or lbe clothes, though the robbers swore thoy pointed out tbe identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind wos 6ewildered in conjectures, 6ut he at last relurned, eonvinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary 0f a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently confpired to hcighten tbat superstitious melclncholy that bad seized upon his mind, hc resolved to leave jt, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whjle woiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had wjth hjm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other thlngs there was a case containing several weapons of ofsence, more or lcss adapted to ensvre the death of the victim. There were several daggersand cllaghans. Whjlst turning thcm over, and examining their cvrious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain surther proof, he found the woapon, and hi\u017f harr0r may be imagined whcn he discovered that it filted, though poouliarIy shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certajnty\u2014they seemed gazing ta be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the sarne varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no roam for doubt; there were cllso drops of bl0od on eclch.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquirief were c0neerning the lady he hadattempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductiue orts. Her parents were jn distress, their fortune ruiried, and sbe had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Auhrey's rnind became almost broken under so many repeated h0rrors; hc was afraid that this lady had fa1len a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his on1y occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save lhe life os some one he held dear. He arrived clt Calais; a breeze, which seemed abedjent to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathers, and tbere, for a moment, appeared tolose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all mcmory of the past. If she besore, hy her jnfontine caresse\u017f, had gclincd his affectiori, now that the woman began ta appear, sho was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winnjng grace which gains the gaze and applavse of lhe drawing-room clssemblies. There wcls none of that llght brilliancy which only exists in the heated atinosphero 0f a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was riever lit up 6y the levity of the mind 6enoath. There was a melanchoIy charm about it which did not seem ta arise from misforturie, but from some feeling within, that appeclrod to iridlcale a souI eonseiovs of a brighter realrn. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a calour may attract\u2014it was sedate and perisive. When aIone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy;but when ber brother breathed to ber his affection, arid wauld in her prosence forget those griefs she knew destroycd his resl, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the vo1uptvary? It seemed as if th0se eyes,\u2014that fclce were then playjng in the light of their own native sphere. Shc wos yet only e ighteen, and had not bcen presented to the world, itbaving been tho ught by her guardjans rnore fit that ber presontation should be delayed until her brother's return from thc continent, when he might beher protector. It was now, therefore, rcsolved that the riexl drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be lhe epoch of her entry inla lhe \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would ratber have remained in thc mansion of his fathers, arid fed vpon the inelancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest obout the frivolitjes of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he bad witnessed; but he delermined to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and propored for tbe next day, which had been clnnounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room hod riot been held for a long time, and all who were anxi0us lo bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sifter. While he was \u017ftanding in a carner by hiinself, heedless of all arovnd him, cngaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Rulhven wcls in that very place\u2014he fell himself sudderily seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardIy courage to lurn, searsul of seeirig a spectre that would bIast him, wheri he perceived, at a little distance,the same figure which had attracted his notice ori lhis spot upori his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to lake the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried fteps, and fixed his handsupon bis head, as if he were afraid his tboughts were hursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances startod up in dreadful array\u2014the daggcr\u2014his oath.\u2014He rovsed himself, he could nat believe it possible\u2014the dead rise agoin!\u2014He thovghl his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upori. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determined, tberefore, to go again into fociety; for tbough he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed iri gaining information. He went a few nights after with bjs sister to the assembly of a near relation. Loaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a recoss, and there gave himself up to his own devouring tbaughts. Perceiving, at lost, thal many were leauing, be roused hlmself, and entering ariother room, faund his sister surrounded by soveral, apparently in oarnest c0nuersation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom be requested to move, turned round, and revealed t0 him thosc foatures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm,and, with hurr ied step, forced hor towards the street: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowdof servants who were waiting for their lord s; and while he was engaged in passing lhem, he agaln heord that voice whisper clo\u017fe to him\u2014\"Rem-\nember your oatb!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon r eached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one svbjeot, how much more completely was it cngrossed, now that the cortainty os the monstcr's Iiving agairi pressed upon his tboughts. His sister's attentioris were now unhceded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explaln t0 her what hod caused his abrupt conduct. He 0nly uttered cl few words, and those tcrrified her. The mare he thought, the more he was bewildcred. His oath stortled him;\u2014wa\u017f be then to allaw this morister to roarn, 6earing rulri upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? Hls very sifter might have been touched by him. Bul even if he were lo break bis oath, and djselose his suspicions, who wovId bolieve him? Ho thought of employing hif owri hand to sree tbe world from sucb cl wrelch; but death, heremembered, had boen already mocked. For days he remained in lhis state; shut up in his room, ho saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wh0, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support nature. At lasl, no Ionger cclpable of 6earing stillness and solilude, he left bis house, roamed from stroet to strcct, arixious to fly that image which haunted him. Hjs dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as oftcn exposed to the noon-day sun as lo the midnight dampf. He was no langer to be recognized; at first he returned with the euening to the house; bul at lclst he laid him dawn to rest wherever fatigue overtook hiin. His sister, anxious for bif safety, employcd people to follow him; bul they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. Hjs conduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea thal he lefl by bis absence the whole of bis friends, with a fiend amongst them, ofwhose preserice they were unconscious, he determlnod to eriter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarri, iri fpite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approaohed with intjmacy. Butwhen be entered into o r0om, his haggard and suspicious looks were s0 striking, his inward shudderingf so vislble, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, o fociety whioh afsected him so ftrongly. When, however, remonstranoe proved uriavailing, the guardioris tho ught proper to interposo, and, foaring that his mind was bocoming alienatod, they thovght it hlgh time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thom by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from lbe injurles and sufferings he had daily encountered in hif wandcrings, and of prev enting him from exposing to the general eye lhose marks of what they considered folly, they erigagod a physician to reside in the housc, and take eorislant corc of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, sa camplcteIy was hls mirid absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so gr eat, that he was conflned to hif cham6er. Tbere he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. Hc had 6ecoine emacjated, his eye\u017f had attained a gIassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itsolf upon tbe entry of hif sister; then hc would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks lhat severely afflicted her, he would de\u017fire her not to touch hirn. \"Dh, do not touch him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Whori, boweuer, she inquired to wbom hereferred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" arid again he sank into a stote, wherice not even she could rouse him. This lasted many monlhs: graduaIly, bowever, as the year was passing, his incoherences becamo less frequent, and his mirid threw off a portion of its glaom, whilst his guclrdians observod, that scveral times in the day he would count vpon his fingers a defi-\nnite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day ofthe year, one of his guardians entering his room, begari to canverse with his physician upon the rnelancholy oircumstonce of Aubrey'\u017f being in so awful a sjtuatian, when his sister was going next day t0 be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiovsly to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Mclrsden. Thjnking this was a yovng Earl whom ho had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astoriished them still more hy his expressing his jntentjon lo be presont at the nuptials, and desiring t0 see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He wa\u017f apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet witb tears, flowing at the thought of bcr 6rother's being once more alive lo lhe feelings of afsection. Hc began to speak with all his worited warmth, and to corigrotulate her upon hcr marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evory aceomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon hor breast; opening it, what was his surpriso at bcholding the features of the morister who had so long inflvenced hi\u017f life. Hesei2ed the portrait ln a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it urider foot. Upon ber asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblarice of her future husband, he looked as is he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, sor ho\u2014 But he cou1d nat advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice agajn badc him remember his oalh\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was noar him but saw no onc. In the meantime the guardians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He foll upon his knees to them, he implored, he begg ed of them to delay but for oric day. Tbey, attributirig this lo the insanity they imagined had taken possessiori of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after thedrawing-room, and had been refused wilh overy one else. Wheri he heard of Aubrcy's illhealth, he readily vnderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he leclrned lhat hewas deemed insane, his exultatlon and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of hisformer oompanion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could rcsist his power? Hif tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of anindividual having no sympatby with any being on tho c rowded earth, save with her to whoin he addressed himself;\u2014covld tell how, sjnee he knew her, his existerioe, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were morely that he might listen to her soothing aceents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpenl's art, or such was the wil1 of fate, tbat he gained her affeclions. Tbe title of the eldor branch falling at longth lo him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excvse far haftening the marriage, (in spite of her br0ther's deranged stato,) which was lo take place the very day before his departure far the continerit.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe tbc servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiriess, bcr own honour, arid the horiour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and thc h0pe of their house, to delay but for a few bours that marriage, on whleh he denounced the mosl heavy cursef. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any morethe mind 0f Miss Aubrey by, what hc considored, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to tbe bufy jnmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easlly be conceived than doscribed, the nole\u017f of busy preparation. Morning came, and thc sound of carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leavjng him in the custody os an helpless old woman. He seized tho opporturiity, with one bound was avt of the room, and in a mornent faund him\u017felf in the apartment where all wcre neclrly assem6led. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately app-\nroached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from tbe room, specchless with rage. When on the slaircafe, Lord Ruthven whispered iri his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your \u017fister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saylng, he pushed him towards his ottendants, who, roused by the old woman, had oome in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himse1f; his rage not sinding vcnl, had broken a blood-uessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to hjs sister, who was not preserit when be entered, as tbe physician was afraid of agltating her. The marriage was solemnized, and lhe bride and bridegroom left Lond0n.\nAubrey'sweakness jncreased; tbe esfusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approaoh of death. He desired his sister's guardians rnight be callcd, and when the midnlght hour had struck, he related compo\u017fedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died iinmediotely after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrcy; 6ut when lhey arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nA CC0UNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world waf all before him, where to choofe hjs place of rest, and Providenee his guide.\"\nIN Sajling through the Grecian Archipelago, on boclrd one of his Majesty's vessels, in lhe year 1812, we put jnto the harbour af Mityleno, in the island of tbat name. The boauly of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables alwoys to be had there, iriduce many British vessels to visit it\u2014bothmen of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rat her out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bourities amplyrepcly for the deviation af cl voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed iri watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with tbe natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble lo the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Grcek cls ovr guide, who told us he bad come from Scio with an Englifh lord, who lest the island four days prevjovs to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said tho Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did n0t choofe lo quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to get mclrried. He wcls an odd, but a vcry good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (obaut L250 English currency,) and haf resided there about fourteen months, though not conslantly; for he sails jn his felucca very often to the diffe rent islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the houfe where our countryman had resided. We were kindly recolved by cln old mari, wh0 conducted us over the mansion. It consistod os four aparlmenls on lhe grovnd-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlaur, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all slmply decorclted: plain green-stained walls, marble tablcs on either \u017fide, a large myrt1e in the oentre, and a small fountain benca-\nth, wbich could be made to play through tbe branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small hronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa comp1eted the furnitvre. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chalrs, and an emply book-cafc: thereworc no mirrors, riar a singIe pai-\nnting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the commori bed throughout Greece. In lhe sitting-roam we observed a marble reooss, formerly, the old inan told us, fi1led wilh books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chesl in the closet:it was open, bvt we did not think ourselves jvstified in examinlng the conterits. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire'\u017f, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau's works complcte; VoIney's Ruin\u017f of Ernpires; Zimrnermari, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novoIs; Schi1ler's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editi0n, printed at Porma in 1810; seueral small pamphletsfrom the Greek press at Constantinople, muoh torn, but no English book of any description. Most ofthese books were filled wilh mclrginal notes, written with a pencil, in It alian arid Latin. The Mes\u017fiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of papor, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been readingthese hooks lhe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them wltb the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie untll his return; for he is so particular, that wore I to move one thjng without orders, he wauld frown upon me sor a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did hjm a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble af taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in tho wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adriariople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nTho appearancc of the house externally was pleasing. The portico infront was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars wilh b1ack p1inlhs and fret-work cornlces, (as it is now customary in Grecian arcbilecture,) were considerably higher than tho ro0f.The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wos coverod by a flne Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of ftrong coarse linen. Mostof the house-tops are thvs fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass lheir evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eclting fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house,a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were cluftering logether on its bordors, clnd under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamental wooden back was plaeed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights til1 twelve o'clook, reading, writing, and talkingto himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very deuout, \"and always attended ovr ehurch twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led tbe eye to Movnt Calela, covered with olive and myrtle troes iri bloom, ond on the summit of which an anoient Greek temple appeared jn majestic decay. A small stream js\u017fuing from the ruins descended in 6rokon cascades, until it was l0st in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observcd, studding the 1ight blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom onjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as lo the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew bis riame but Dominick, hj\u017f banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will nat,\"\u2014\"And carinot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said be, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit tbc Armenian, but on our return to the towri we learnt severol particvlars of tbc isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and everi danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cowto one man, horses to others, and c0tton clnd silk to the girls who live by weaving thesc articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman wbo bad lost hisown in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to the poor children. In short, be appeared to us, from clll we collecled, to have been a very eccentric and benevolenl character. One circumstarice we learnt, whicb our old friend ot the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautifu1 doughter, with whom the lord was osten seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught hor himself lhe use of it.\nSuch was the informatlon wilh which we departed from the peaceful isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who lhis rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued al Palermo, all our daubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelllng in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"ahout wbom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the islclnd of Tenedos, and I also visitcd him at Mjtylene.\" We had ne ver then heard of his lordship's faine, as we had been s0me years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla jn every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mityleno on some future dcly; but to me that day will riever retum. I make this statement, believing it not qulte uninteresting, and in justiee to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod.He has been deserihed as os an urifeeling disposition, auerse to associating wlth human nature, or conlributing in any way lo sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direclly therever\u017fe, as may be ploinIy gathered from these little anecdotes. A1l the finer seelings of the heart, so elegantIy deplcted in his lordship's poems, seem to hclve th eir seat in hif bosom. Tenderness, sympalhy, arid charily appear to guide all his actjons: and his oourling the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him cls a being on whose heart Religiori hath set her sea1, and ouer whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mant-\nle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" wilhout feeling proud of hirn as a cauntryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures,I do not assume a right to give an opinion.

Am0ng the Arabians it appears to he common: it did not, however,extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Chri\u017ftiariity; clnd it has orily assumed its preserit f0rm since the division of the Lotin and Greek churches; at which time, the ideo hecaming prevalent, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually iricreased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful \u017ftories, still extant, of the dead rising from thcir graves, and feeding upon tbe blood of tho young and heaulifvl. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorrajne, where the belief existed, that vampyrcs nigbtly iinbibod a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst the\u017fe human blood-\n-suckers fattened\u2014and their velns becamc distended to such a state of repletion, as to cavse the blood to flow fr0m all the passages oftheir bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, os March, 1732, is a curious,and, of course, credible clccount of cl partlcular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hvngclry. It appears, that upon an examiriation of the commander-in-chief and magiftrales of the plclce, tbey p0sitively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, thal, at Cassovia, on lhe frontjers of the Turkifh Servia, ho had been tormenled by a vampyre, but had sound a way to rid himsclf of the evil, by eating soine of the earth out af the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himsolf with his blood.This precaution, however, did not preve nt him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty dclys after his death and burial, many persons complained 0f having been tormented by him, and a deposition wcls made, that four porsons had been deprived of life by bis attacks. To prevent surther mischief, the inhabitants having corisulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is svpposed to be usucll in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption,and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pvre and florid blood. Proof hauing been thus obtained, lhey resorted t0 the accustomod remedy. A stake was driven entireIy through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, ot whlch he is reported to have cried out as dreodfully as if he had beenalive. This done, they cut off his bead, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his graue. The same ineasvres were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrisrn, lest they \u017fhould, ln their turn, become agents upon others who survivcd them.\nThe universalbelief is, that a persori sucked 6y a vampyre becomcs a vampyre bimself, and sueks in his turn.\nChief bailifs.\nThis monst rous rodomontade is here related, becaufe it seems bctter adapted to il1ustrate the subject of tho present observations than ariy olher instance which couId be addvced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sorl of punishment afterdeath, for some bein ous crime eommitted whilst in exislence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to eonfine hi\u017f infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon eorth\u2014those to whom he was bound hy ties of kindrod ond affection.\u2014A supposltion alludod to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb he rent; Then ghostly haunt lbe natjve place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy dclughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streorn of life; Yet loalhe the banquctwhioh perforoe Must feed thy livid living corse, Thyvictims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for thoir sire; As cursing thee, thou curfing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one tbat for thy crimemust fall, The youngest, best beloved of a1l, Shall blefs thee witb a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap lhy heart in flame! Yet thou must end tby task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014hereye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unbaIlowed hand shall tear The trc\u017fses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest plodge was warn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy su1len grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Asrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introducedin his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaha,\" the vampyre cor\u017fe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grove for the purpose of tormentjng him she best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence. Bul tbis cann0t be \u017fupp0sed to bave refulted from the sinfulness of her life, she belng pourlrayed throughoul the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The verac ious Tournefort gives a long clccount ln his travels of several ast onishing cases of uampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitnesf; and CaImet, in his great work upon thjs subjeot, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradjtionary riarrotives iIlustrative of its esfects, has put forth some learned disfcrtations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarlan error.\nMany cvrious ond interesllng notices 0n this singularly horribIe superstition might be cldded; though the present may suffice for the Iimitf of a noto, riecessarlly devated to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, thal though the term Vampyre js the one in most goneral acceptati0n, there are several 0thers synonymous with it, made use of in various parls of tbe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attondarit upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for hissingularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participato therein. Apparcnlly, the light laughter of the fair only attracted hls attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thougbtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain whenee it arose: fome attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fi xing upon the object's face, did not soem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the beart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peouliaritief caused him to be lnvited to every house; all wjshed to sce him, and those wh0 had been aecustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the welght of ennui, wero pleclsed al having something in their presence capable of engaging their attenlion. In spite 0f the deadly hue of his face, which neuer g ained a warmer tinl, either from the blush of modesty, or fr0m the slrongemotion of pa\u017fsian, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the scmclle hunters after notoricty attempled to win his atteritions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term asfection: Lady Mercer, who had 6een the mockery of overy monsler shewn iri drawing-rooms \u017fince her marriage, threw herself in hisway, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014w hen she stood before him, though his eyeswore apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if tbey were unperceiued;\u2014even her vnappalled impuderice waf baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress c0uld not influence euen the guidance of his eyes, il was not that the female sex was iridifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent doughter, thal few kriew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the repulatlon of a winning tongue; ond whether it wos that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moued by his clpparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the 6oast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orpban left with on only sister in the posfefsion of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Loft also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of hls fortune, wbile they relinqulshed the more imp0rtant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivotod more his imagination than his judgment.He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, wbich d aily ruins fo many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thovghl that vice was thrown iri by Providence mere1y for the picturesque effect of thc scene, as we sce in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in tbe vesting os elothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by thcir irregular folds and various coloured pcltches. He thought, in fine, thal the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He wa\u017f handsome, frank, and rich: for tbese reasonf, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favouritcs: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances whon he approached, and by their sparkljng eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lod him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to tho romance of his solitary hours, he was starlled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from lhe presence of a ghost, but from want of snufsing, tbere was no foundation in reol life for any of that congeries of pleasjng pictures and defcriptions contclined in lhose volumes, from which he had formed his study. Flnding, however, \u017fome compensation in his gra-\nlified vanity, he was ab0ut to relinquish hls dreams, wben the extraordinary being we have above doscribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibi lity of formirig an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed ln bimscIf, who gave few otber signs of his observation of exlernal objects, tban the tacit assent to their existcrice, imp1ied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allawing his imagination to picture euery thing that flattered its propensity to extravagarit ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person beforc him. He bocame acquainted with him, paid him attcnti0ns, and so far advanced upon his notice, lhat his preserice was always recognised. He gradually learnt that LordRuthven's affairs were einbarrassed, and soon fourid, fram the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was abaut to travel. Desirous os gainjng some infarincltion respecting this singular character, who, tjll now, hod only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiori\u017f, that it was time for him lo perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towardsputting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever fcandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of ploasantry or of p raise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They conserited: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his jntentions to Lord Rvthvon, was surpriscd to recejve from him a proposal to join him. Flallered by such a mark af esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothjng in comman with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few doys they had passed the oircling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had hcld no opportunity of \u017fludyirig Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the refults offered different conclusions from the apparenl motives to bis c0nducl. His c0mpanion was profu\u017fe in hls liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagobond, and tbe beggar, received from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid rernarking, that it waf not upon thc virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortvnes attendant evcn up0n vjrtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sonl from the door with hardly supprcssed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to rclieve his wants, but t0 allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. Tbis was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vioious, which gonerally prevails over thc retiring bashfu1ness of the virtuous jndigcrit. There was one cirovmstonce about the cbority of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon bis mind: all those upon wh0m it waf bestowed,inevitahly fovnd that there was a curse upori it, for they were all either lod to thescaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the rnost abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which lhey passed, Aubrey was surprjzed at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for tbe centres of all fashionable vice; thcrc he enlered inlo aIl the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and alwoys garnhled with success, except where the known shclrper was his antagonist, clnd then he l0st even more than he gained; but jt was always with the same unchanging foco, with which he generally watehed the society around: it was not, however, so when he encauntcred lhe rafh youthful novice, or the luckIoss father of a numerous family; then hjs very wish seemed fortune's Iaw\u2014this appclrent abstractedness of mirid was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than thal of the cat whilst dallying with lhe half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the sormerly affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungean, lhe fate that had drawn hiin within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father fat sranlic, amidst the speaking looks of mutc hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even susficient ta satisfy their present craving. Yethe took no money froin the gambllng table; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the laft gilder be had just snatched from tho convulsive grasp of the innoeent: this might but be the refu1t os a certain degree of kn0wledge, which was nat, however, cclpable of cornbating the cunning of the more experienced. Avbrey oston wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to rcsign thol charity and pleasure which proved the ruin 0f alI, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he h0ped bis friend would give him some opportunity of speakirig frankly and 0penly to him; however, this never occurred. Lard Ruthven in his carriagc, and amjdst the various wiId and rjch scenes 0f nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his ljp; ond though Aubrey was near the object of his curlosity, he obtairied no greater grotification fram it than tbe constant excitement os vainly wifhing to break that mystery, which to hjs exalled imaglnation hegan to assumc the appearance of somethlng supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at R0me, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his cornpanion; he left him jn daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search af the memoriols of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letter\u017farrived from England, whicb he opened with eagor impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the other\u017f were from his guardians, the latter astonisbed him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was ari evil p0wer resident in bis oompanion, these seemed to give him sufficierit reason for the bellef. Hls guardians insisted upon his immedialely leclving his friend, and urged, that his choracter was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rondered his licentious hablts more dangerous to society. It had beeri discovered, that his contempt for lhe adultresf had not originated in batred of ber eharacter; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, shauld be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to tbe lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: ln flne, that all those semales whom he had soughl, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, throwri eueri the mafk aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deforinity os their vices to tbe public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, wh0se character had n0t yet shown a single bright point on which to rcst the eye. He resolved to invent some plau\u017fiblo pretext for obandoning him allogether, purposing,in tho rnean while, to wateh hlm more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, ond soon pereeived, that his Lordship was endeauovring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly froquented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thereforeobliged to carry onhi\u017f plans in secr et; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon discouered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most Iikcly end in the ruin of an lnnocent, though thoughtless girI. L0sing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthveri, ond abruptly asked him his jntentions with respcct to the lady, informing him at the fame time that he was aware of bis beingabout to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thal his intentions were such as he supposed all would haveupon such an occasion; and upon being prcfsed whcther he iritended to marry her, merely loughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writirig a note, to say, that fr0m that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the rcmaindor af their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to \u017feek other apartments, and calling upon thc rnother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daugbter, bvt aIso concerning the character af his Lordship. The assignaliori was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his fervant to riotify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plaris having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey direcled his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found hjmself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house 0f a Greek; and soon occupied him\u017felf in tracing the faded recordf of ancient glory upon mo numents that apparently, ashamed of chroriicling the deeds of freemen only be fore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the shelteririg soil or inany coloured lichen. Under the sclme roof as hlmse1f, existed a being, so beautifu1 and delicate, that she might have forrned the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on oanvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradlso, save lhal her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she c0u1d be1ong to those who had no souls. As sbe danced upon tbe plain, or tripped along the movnt-\najn's side, one would have thought the gazelle o poor type of her becluties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparentIy the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited 6vt to tbe tclste of on epicure. The light step of Iarithe oflen accompanied Aubrey in hif search after antiquities, clnd often would the unconscious girl,erigaged in the pur\u017fuit of a Kashmero butterfly, show tho whole beouly of ber forrn, floating as il were upon the wind, to lhe eager gaze of hjm, who forgot tholotters hc had just decypheredupon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses fcllling, as shc flitted around, exhihit in the sun's ray such dclicately brjlliant and swiftly fading hues, jt might weIl excuse the forgelfulness of the antiquary, who lel o\u017fcape from hls mind the very object he had beforo thought 0f vital importancc to the proper interpretation os a passage iri Pausanias. But why attempt to descrlbe charrns which all fcel, but none can approciate?\u2014It was innocenco, y0uth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawirig-raoms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew tbose remains of which he wished to preserve a mernorial for his suture bours, she w0uld stand by, and watch the magic effects of hjs pencil, in lracing the scenes of her native plclce; sbe would then describe to him the circlirig dance upon tbe open plain, would pairit, to him in all theglowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembored viewing in hcr infancy; and thon, tvrri-\ning to subjects that had evidently made a greater iinpression vpon her mind, would tell bim all the svpematural tales of her nurse. Her earnestncss arid apparent belief of what sbe narrated, excited tbe interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the lale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frierids, and dcarest ties, forced euery year, by foeding upan the life of a lovely female lo prolorig hi\u017f existencc f0r the ensuing montbs, his blaod would run cold, whilst he atlompted to laugh her out of such idle and horriblo fantasies; but Ianthe citod to him the names 0f old men, who had at la\u017ft detected one living among themselves, after several of thejr near relatives and cbildren had heen found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so increduIous, she bogged of him to helieve her, for it had been, rernarked, that tbose who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given,which obliged them, with grief and heartbreakjng, to confess it was true. She detailed to hjm the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his h0rror was increased, by hearlng a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted inpersuading her, that lbere could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wonderod at the many coincidencef which had all tended to excite a 6elief in the supematural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attacb himself m0re arid more to Ianthe; her inn0cence, so contrasted with all tho affected virtues of thc women among whom he hcld sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he rldiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greck girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, farming a plan for some antiquarian research, he w0vld depart, delermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impassible to fix bis attention upon thc rvins around him, whilst in his mjnd he retained an image that seemed alono tbe rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscious of his love, and was ever lhe same frank infantile being be hod first known. She olways seemed to part from him with roluctclnce; but it was becausc she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied insketching 0r uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructjve hand of time. She had appealed to her parents ori the subject os Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existerice, pale with horror at the very name. Soon aftcr, Aubrey determiried to proceed upon ono of hls exeursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; whon they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him nol to retum at night, as he must riecessarily pass through a wood, where rio Greck would ever remain, after the dcly had closed, upon ony consideration. They described it as the resort of the vainpyres in their nocturnal orgles, and denounced the mosl heavy evil\u017f a\u017f impending upon him who dared to eross their path. Aubrey made light of thejr representations, and tried to laugh thern out of lhe idea; but wheri hc faw them shudder at his daring thus ta moek a superior, infernal power, the very name of wbich apparently made their bIood froeze, hc was silent.\nNext morriing Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattonded; he wa\u017f surprised to observo the melancholy face of his bost, and was concerned to find that hi\u017f words, mocking the bolief of thase horrible fiends, had inspired them with sucb terror. When he was aboutto depart, Ianthe came t0 the \u017fide 0f his horso, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the p0wer of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promifed. He was, however, s0 occupied in his research, that he did nat perceivc that day-light wovld soon end, and that in the barjzon there wa\u017f one os thase specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a lremendous mass, and pour all thoir rage upon the devoted counlry.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, delermined to make up hy \u017fpeed for bis delay: hutit was too late. Twilight, in tbese southem climcltes, is alrnost vnknown; immediately the sun sets, night 6egjns: and ere he had advanced far, the powcr of the storm was above\u2014itsechoing thunders had \u017fearcely an iriterval of rest\u2014its thick heclvy rain forced ils way through the canopying folioge, whil\u017ft the bIue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate al his very feet. Sudderily his horfe took fright, and he waf carried witb dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightnjng, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he opproached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at lcast trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woinari mingling with the stifled, exultant mockc ry of a laugh, continuod in one cllrnost unbroken sound;\u2014he was starlled: but, roused by the lhurider which agaln rolled over his hecld, he, with a sudden efforl, foreed open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sound\u017f continvcd, and no notice was taken of him. He faund himself in contact wilb some one, whom he immediately sei2od; wben a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugb fucceeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himseIf upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, bad placed bif hands upan his throal\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through the holo that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014be instantly rose, and, leclving his proy, rushed through the door, and in cl rnoment the crashing of the branches, as he brokc through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; clnd Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those withovt. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At tbe desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had atlracted him by her crles; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the t0rchef once moro burst upon hirn, to perceiue the airy form of his fair conductress broughl jn a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising srom his disturbedimclgination; hvl he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretchedby his side. Tberc was no colour upon hor cheek, not evcn upon her lip; yet therc was a slillness about her face that scemed almost as attaohirig as tbe life that once dwe lt there:\u2014upon her neck and breaft wcl\u017f blood, and upon her thraat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the meri polnted, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quiokly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of ber wbo had lately been to him the object of somany bright and fairy visions, now sallen wjth the flower of life that had died within hcr. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014bis mind was benumbed and seerned to \u017fhvn reflection, arid take refuge in vacancy\u2014he heId aImost unconsciously in his hand a naked daggor of a particular construction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon mel by differenl parties who had been engagod in the seclroh of her whom a mother hcld rnissed. Their lamentabIe cries, as they approached the city, sorewarried the parents of some drcadsvl cata\u017ftrophe. \u2014To describe their griof w0vld bo impo\u017fsible; but when they ascerlained the cause of thoir child's deatb, theylooked at Aubrey, and painted to the corse. They were incons0lclble; both died hroken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with a most violent fcver, and waf often delirious; in these intoruals he would call upon Lard Rulhven and upon Ianthc\u2014by some unaccountable combination he seemcd to beg of his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictiaris upon bis head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at lhis time to arrive clt Athens, and, from whatever mative, upon hearing of the stale of Aubrey, immediately placed himse1f in the same hovse, and bocame his conslant attendont. Whenthe latler rccovered from his deliriuin, he was horrified and slartled at the sight of him whose imoge he had now combined with tbat of a Vampyrc; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault tbat had caused their seporation, and still more 6y the attention, anxicty, and care whlch he showed, soon reconciled hlm to his prcsence. His lordship seemed quite changod; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Avbrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired inlo the sarne stato of mjnd, and Aubrey pcrceived no dlfferenco from the former man, except thatat times he was svrprised to rneet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation plclying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During lhe last stclge ofthe invalid's recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparenlly engclged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveles\u017f fun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avaid the cyef of all.\nAubrey's mirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whjch had orice so distinguished him n0w seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and filenoe as Lord Ruthven; bvt much as he wished f0r solitvde, his mind eould not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had farmerlyfrequentcd, Ionthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sougbt it jn the woods, her light step wo uld appear wandering amidst tbe urid erwood, in quest of the madest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginotion, hor pale face arid w0unded throat, wlth a meek smile vpon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of wbich creoted such bitter assoeiations in his mind. He pr0posed to Lord Ruthven, to wbom he held himself bound by tho tendercaro he had taken of him during his illnes\u017f, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every diroction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could 6e altached: but though they thus ha\u017ftened from place to place, yet they seemod not to heod what they gazed upon. Theyheard much of r0bbers, but they gradually began to sligbt the\u017fe reparts, which lhey imagined were only the inuention of indjviduals, whose interest it was to excite lhe gerieroslty of those whom they defended from preton-\ndcd dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice af the inhabitants, on one occasion they travel1ed wlthonly a few guards, more to serve as guides thcln as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrcnt, with large inafses of rock brought down from the neighbauring pr ecipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the wbole of the parly engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close lo their heads, and by the echoed report of scveral guns. In an instant their gvards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had b egun lo fire in lhe djreotion whenco the report came. L0rd Ruthven and Avbrey, imitoting their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouls bade them advarice, clnd being exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robber\u017f sh0uld clirnb above and take them iri the rear, they delermiried at onceto rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rvthven receivod a shot in the shoulder,which 6rought him to the ground. Avbrey hastenod lo his assislance; and, no longer hoeding the contest or his owri peril, was soon surpriscd by seeing the r0bbers' faces around h im\u2014his gvards having, upon Lord Ruthuen'\u017f being wounded, immediately thr own up their clrms and surrendered.\nBy promises of greal reward, Avbrey foon indvced them to convey his wounded frjend to a neig hbouring cabin;and having agreed upon a ran\u017fom, he was no more disturbed by their prescnce\u2014tbey being content merely to guord the cntrance till their comrade shouldroturn with the promised sum, for which he had an order. LordRuthven's flrerigth rapidly decreclsed; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance bad nol changed; he scemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of tho last evening, his inind became apparently uneasy, and hif eye often fixcd upon Aubrey, who was induced to osser his assistance with more than usual oarnestness\u2014\"Assist me! yov may save ine\u2014you may do more thari that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the deatb of my existenceas little as that of lhe passing day; bvt you may save my honour,your frierid's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life eb6s apace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal aIl you know of mc, my honour were free from stain iri the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall riot be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raisirig himself with exullant uiolence, \"Swear by all your sovl reveres, by all your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my orimes or death to clny living boing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursling from thejr \u017foekets: \"I \u017fwear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retircd to rost, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintonce with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiuering camo over him, as if from thc prescnliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising oorly in lhe morning, he was clbout lo enter the hovel in which he had Ieft lhe corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, la the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise tbey had given his 1ordship, that itshould be exposed to the first c0ld ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey asto riished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury jt upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he f0und no traoe of either the oorpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore lhey poinled out the identioal rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced lhat they had buried lhe corp\u017fo for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a covntry in which ho had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid iri which all apparentIy conspired to heighten that superstitious meIaricholy that bad seizcd upon hi\u017f mind, he resolved to leave il, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting sor a vessel to conuey him to Dtranto, or to Naples, he occupled himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, rnore 0r less adapted to ensure the deatb of the victim. There were several da ggors and atoghans. Whilst tvrning thein over, arid examining lheir cvrious forms, what was his surprise at finding a fbeath apparcntly ornamented in the same sty1e as the dagger disoovered in the fatal but\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagincd when he discoverod that it fittcd, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need rio further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound lo the dagger; yet stiIl he wished to disbelieve; bvt the particuIar form, the same varying tints upon the haft ond sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left n0 room for doubt; there were also drops 0f blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, arid on his way hame, clt Rome, his first inquiries were concernirig the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's scductive arls. Hor parents were in distress, lheir fortune ruinod, and she had not been heard of since the departuro of his lordship. Aubrey'\u017f mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; be was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and \u017filent; and hif only occupation consistcd in urging the speed of the po\u017ftilions, as jf be were going to sove the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calai\u017f; a breezc, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him lo the Engllsh shores; and he hastened to the inansion of hi\u017f fothers, and there, for a rnoment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses os his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her lnfantine caresses, had gained his affeclion, now that the woman began to appear, she was stlll more attoching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Hor blue eye was never lit up by the lcvity of thc mind 6eneath. There waf o melancholy charm about it whjch did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared lo indicate o saul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a buttcrfly or a col0ur may altract\u2014it was sedate andpensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breothed to her his affection, and would iri her presence forget thofe griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for lhat of the voIuptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of thoir own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been preserited to the world, it hauing been thougbt by her guardians more fit that her presentation fhould be delayed until hcr brother's retum from the continent, whcn he might be her protector. Il was riow, therefore, re solved that the next drawing-ro0m, which was sast approachjrig, sh0uld be the epoch of her entry into lhe \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the man\u017fion ofhis fatberf, and fed upori the melancholy wh ich 0vcrpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he hcld witnessed; but he delerrnined to sacrifice his own comfortto the pratection of his sjster. They so0n arrived in town, and prepared forthe next day, which had been announcod as a drowing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing- room had not been held for a Iong time, and all wh0 were anxious to bask in the smile 0f royalty, hastened tbilher. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembranoe thol the first time he had feen Lord Rutbven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself svddenly seized by the orm, and a voioe he recogni2ed too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre thot would blast him, when he percelved, at a little distance, tbe same figure which had attracted his nolice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almoft refufing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself inta his carriage, and was driven horne. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixcd hif hands upon his head, as if he wereafraid his thought\u017f were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again befare him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014lhe dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe it po\u017fsiblo\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He lbought his imagination had conjured up the imoge his mlnd wos resting vpon. It was imposslblo that it could be real\u2014be determined, therefore, to go again int0 society; for thaugh he ottempted to ask concerning Lord Rulhven, tbe name hvng vpon his lips, and he could nol sucoeed in gclining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assemb1y of a near relation. Leaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a rccess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thought\u017f. Perceiving, at last, that many were leavlng, he rovsed bimself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by seueral, apparently in earnest c0nversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, whcn one, whom he requested to move, turncd round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sjster's arm, and, witb hurried step, sorced her towards the strect: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were wcliting for their lords; andwhile be waf engaged iri passlng them, he again heard that voice whisper clo\u017fe ta him\u2014\"Remember y0ur oath!\"\u2014He did nat daro to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon rcachod bome.\nAubrey becarne almost distracted. If before his mind hcld been absorbed by orie subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty 0f the monster's living agcliri pressed upon hif thovghts. His sister's atteritions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she jntroated him to cxplairi to hcr what had oaused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oathstartled bim;\u2014was he then to a1low this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His uery sister might havo been touched by bim. But evon is be were lo break his aath, and dis-\nclose hjs su\u017fpioions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the worldfr0m such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For dayshe remairied in this state; shut vp iri his room, he \u017faw no one, and ote only when his sister came, who, with eyes streoming with tears, hesovght hlm, far her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and salitude, he left his housc, roamed sram street tostreet, anxious to fly lhat imogo whicb hounted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often expo\u017fed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damp\u017f. He was no longor to be recagnized; at first he returned with the eueriing to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whereuer fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiovs f0r his safety, employed people to follow him; but lhey wore soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuor swifter than any\u2014srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea thclt he left by his absence the whole of his frlends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconsciovs, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spiteof his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with int-\n imacy. But when he cntered into a room, his haggard and suspiciovs looks were so strik ing, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister wcls at last ohliged to bcg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which clffected him sa strorigly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians tbought proper to interpo\u017fe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming a1ienatod, lhey thought it hightime to resume again that trust which had been before imposed up0n lhem by Aubrey's parerils.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferlngs he had dai1y encounlered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposi rig to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the h ouso, arid take eonstant care of him. Hc hardly appeared to notice it, so completely wcls hls mind absorbed by one terrible subiect. His incoheronce became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wavldoften lie for days, incapable of bejng roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only signof affection and recolloction remaining displayed itself upon tbe eritry of his sister;tben he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hclnds, with looks that seuerely afflicted hcr, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your loue for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Wben, however, sbe inquired to whom he referred, hjs only answer was, \"Truo! t rue!\" arid again he sank irito a state, whence not even she could rouse bim. This lasted many moriths: gradua1ly, however, as the year was passing, hi\u017f iricohererices becclme lcss frequent, and bis mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he wauld count upon hif fingers a definite number, clnd then smile.\nThe time had nearIy elapsed, when, upori the last day of theyear, one of his guardians enterjng his room, began to converse wlth his physician upon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubrey's being in s0 awful a sltuation, wben his sister was going riext day to be married. Inftantly Aubrey's altention was attracted; he clsked onxiously to whom. Glad of this mclrk of returning intellect, of which they seared ho had been deprived, they mentioned the name of lhe Earl of Marsden. Thinkirig this was cl young Earl whom he bad met with in society, Aubrey seeined pIeased, arid astonished them still moreby his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sjster. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by lhe influence of ber l0vely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowjng at the thought os her brother's being once more alive to lhe feelings of affection. He began t0 speak with all his worited warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a pers0n so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he sud denly pcrceived cl locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the seatures of the monsterwho had so long influeneed his life. Hc seized theportrait in a paroxy\u017fm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her askirig him why he thus de stroyed the resemblance of her future husband, hc looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expressiori 0f countenance, he badc her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advancc\u2014it seerned as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking L0rd Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard thc whole, and thought this was but cl retvrn of bis djsorder, enlered, and forcing him from Miss Avbrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon hif knees ta thom, he irnplored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attrjbuting thls lo lhe insanity they imagined hod taken possession of his mirid, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and hcld been refused with every one else. When be heard of Avbrey's illhealth, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deomed insane, his exuItalion and pleasure could hardly bo coricealed sr0m those among whom he had gained this information. Hehastened to tbe house of his formcr companion,and, by conslant attendaneo, and the pretence of great affection for lhe brother arid interesl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wbo could resist hi\u017f power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of hjmself as of an indlvidual having no sympathy with ariy 6eing on the crowded earth, save with her lo wbom he addressed himsels;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so wcll how to usc the serperit's art, or such wos the will of fate, that he gained ber affections. The title of the older branch fcllling at length to him, he obtalned ari important embassy, whioh served as an excuse for bastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) wb ich was to take pIace the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but iri vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was giveri him; hc wrote cl letter to bis sister, conjuring ber, as sho valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of lhosc now ln the grave, who oncc held her in their arms os their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few h ours that marrlage, on which he denouncod lhe most heavy curses. The servants promised tbey would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thougbt it better not to harass any m0re the mind of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the rauings af a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily 6o conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the so urid of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grow almost frantic. The curiosity of the seruantf at last ouereame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him ln the custody 0f an he1pless old woman.He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himsels in the opartment where all werc nearly clssembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him:he immediately approached, and, taking his arrn by forco, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whisperedin his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towclrds his attendants, who, roused by tbe old woman, had come in seareh of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not findirig vent, had broken a blood-vessel,and he was conveyed to bed. This was not meritianed t0 his sister, who was not present when he entered, aslhe physician was afrajd of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom lest London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion os blood produced syinptoms of thc near approach of death. He desired hls slstcr's guardians might be called, arid when the midnight hour had struck, be related compo\u017fedly whot the reader has perused\u2014he died immediatcly after.\nThe guardiaris hastened to pratcct Miss Aubrey; but when they arriued, it was toolate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared,and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNTOF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE I SLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The warld was all before him, where to cboose his place of rest, and Provide nce his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vesse1s, in the yoclr 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in tbe island os that name. The beauty of this placc, and the certain supply af eattle and vegetables aIways to be had thorc, induce many British uessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lics rather out of the track for ships hound to Smyrna, its b0unties amply repay for the deviatjon of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at thc bottom of the bay, arid whilst tbe men were einployed in watering, and the purser bargaining far cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took o ramble tothe cave cal1ed Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Idcl (a small monticule so named) we metwitb and engaged a y0ung Greek as our guide, who told uf he had carne from Scio with cln Eng1ish lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in hi\u017f felucco. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sald the Grcek, \"and would have taken me with him; bvt I did not choose to quit Mjtylene, where I am likely to gel married. He was an odd, but a vcry good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of il: he gavo Dominick, lhe wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and bas resided there a6out fourleen m0nths, though not constantly; for he sails in his fel ucca very often to the difserent islands.\"\nThis occount excjted our curio\u017fity very much, ond we lost no time in hastening to the house whcre our countryrnan had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It corisisted of four apartments ori the graurid-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting par1our, and a bed-room, with a spacious cl0set annexed. They were all simply docoratod: plain green-stained walls, marblc tables on oither side, a large myrlle in the ceritre, and a small fountain beneath, whicb could bo made to play through lhe branches by moving a sprjng fixed in the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sosa completed the furniturc. In the hall \u017ftood half a dozen EngIish cane chairs, and an empty book-casc: there were na mjrrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on thc floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilIow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room wo abserved a marble rece\u017fs, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a Iarge seaman's chest in the closet: it wcls open, but we did not think ovrselvos justified in examjning the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau'f, and Rou\u017ffeau's works complele; Volney's Ruiris of Empires; Zimmerman, in tbe German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels;Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an ItaIian edition, printod at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from tbe Greek press at Coristantinople, much torn, but no English book os any description. Most of these books were silled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italianand Lalin. The Messlah was literally scrjbbled oll over, ond m arkod with slips of paper, on which also were rcmarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had bcen rcading these boaks the evening hofore he sailed, and forgot to placc them with the others; but,\" said he, \"thcre thcy must lic until his return; forhe is so particular, that wcre I lo move one thing with0ut orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; ho is otherways very good. I orice did him a service; and I bave the produce of this farm sor the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechincs which I pay to an agcd Armenian who resides in a small coltagc in the wood, and wh0m the lord 6rovgbl herefrom Adrianople; I d0n't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of lhe hause externally was plea\u017fing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as jt i\u017f now customary in Grocian architecturc,) were considcrably higher than the roof. Tbe roaf, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey carpet, boncath an awnirig af strong coarse line n. Most of the house-tops are thus furnishod, cls upon them the Greeks pass their euenings in smoking, drinking lightwirie\u017f, such as \"lachrymcl christi,\" oating sruit, and erijoying the evening brceze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a srnall strcamIet gllded away, grapes, oranges and lime\u017f wcre clustering together on it\u017f borders, and vnder the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his ovenlngs and nights til1 twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and lalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devaut, \"and always attended 0ur church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view srom this seat was what may be terrned \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye toMourit Calc1cl, covered witb ollve and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small ftream issuing from the ruin\u017f descended in broken cascades,until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's bose. The sea smooth af glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiriates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, seueral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light hlue wave with spots of emeraIdgroen. I se1dom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless as to tbe name of the person who had resided iri this romantic solitude: ri0ne knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone t0 Candia. \"The Armenlan,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure hc will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We hadnot time t0 vifit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned oight young girls when he was la\u017ft upon the island, and even dariced with them at the nuptiaI feast. He gave a cow to one man, harses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He als0 bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who hcld lost his own in a gale, and he aften gavc Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we colleoted, to have been a very eccentrie and benevolent character. One circumstance we leclrnt, whiob our old friend at the coltage thought proper not to disclose. He had a rnost beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was ofton seen walking on the sea-shorc, and he had bought hor a pjano-forte, and taught her himsels the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from lhe poaceful isle of Mitylene; our imagination\u017f all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece couldhe. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of dispositi0n, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, aIl aur doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been traveIling jn Egypt and Grccce, \"The individual,\" sald he, \"clbout whom you are so anxjous,is Lord Byron; I met him in my trauels on the island os Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of hls lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the reoluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regrct not having been more curious in aur researohcs at the c0ttage, but we consoled ourselves witb the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slatement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lord ship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has beendesoribcd as os an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating wilh human nature, or contrjbuting in any way to sooth lts sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All thc finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in hi\u017f lordshjp's poems, seem to have their seat in hisbosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide oll his actions: and his eourting the repose of solilude is an addjtiorial reason for marking him as a being on whosc heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whosc head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man cari read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without foeling pr0ud of him as a countryman. With respoct to his loves or pIeasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly wben direeled against mon's moral jntegrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where alI must appear, alone may censure the orrors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's characler is worlhy of his gcnius. To do go0d in secret, and shun the worId's applau\u017fe, is thc suresl testimony of a virtuous heart and sclf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","36":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William PoIidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is uory general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it haf only assumed its present form since the division os the Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea 6eeoming prevalent, lhat a Latin hody could not corrupt if buried in thoir territory, it gradually increased, and formed the svbject of many wondorful stories, still extant, of lhe dead rising fram their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. Iri tbe West it spread, wjth some sljghl variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of tho blood of their victims, who beeame emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptlons; whilst theso hvman blood-sucker\u017f fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to fl0w from all lhe passages of their bodies, and oven srom lhe very pores af their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 173z, is a curious, and,of course, crcdible account of a particular case of vampyrism, w hich is stated to haue occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appears, that upon an examinalion of the commander-iri-chief and mogistrates of tbe place, they pofitively and unanim0usly affirmed, thal, about fivc yeclrs before, a certain Heyduke, namedArnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the fronticrs of the Turkish Servia, be had been lormentedby a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euil, by eati ng same of the earth oul of the vampyre's grave, and rvbbing himself with his blood. This precaution, howcuer, did not prevent him from becoming a varnpyre hiinself; for, abovt twenty or thirty days after his deatb and burial, mariy persons complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attaeks. To prevent further mischies, tho inhabitants having consulted their Hadagnj, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases 0f uampyrism) fresh, and ontirely free srom corruption,and emitting at the mouth, nose, and eors, pure and florid blood. P roof having been thus 0btained, they resorted to lhe accustomed remedy. A stclke was driven entir-\nely through the hearl arid body of Arnold Paul, at wbich he is reported to have cried out af dreadfully cls if he had been allve. This done, they cut off his head, burned hls body, clnd threw the ashes into his grave. The samemeasures were adopted with the corses os thase pers0ns whohad previously died srom vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon other\u017f who survjved thein.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relot-\ned, beoause it seems better adaptedt0 illustrate the subject of the present observali0ns tban any other instance which co uld be adduced. In mclny parts of Greece it is cansidercd as a sort of puriishment ofter death, for fome heinous crime committed whilst jn existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compe1Ied to consinehis infernal visitatjons solely lo those beings he loved ma\u017fl wbile upon earth\u2014tbose to whom he was bound by ties of kindred arid affectiori.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut sirst on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natjve plclce, And suck the blood of alI thy race; There from lhy daughter, slster, wifo, At midnighl drain the stream of lifc; Yet loathe thc banquet whioh perforce Must feed thy livid living c 0rse, Tby victims, cre they yet expire, Shall kriow the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the slem. Bvt one that for thy crime must faIl, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shallwrap thy hoart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's laft tinge\u2014her eye's laft spark, And lhe 1ast glassy glance must viewWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Thon wilh unhallowed hand shall teclr The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life o lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledgc was worn\u2014 But riow is borne away by lheo Memorial of thjne agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Go uls and Afrits rave, TilI tbese in horror shrink clway From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introdueed in hi\u017f wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\"the vampyre eorse of tbe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented af having returned from lhe grave for the purpose of tormenting him sbe best loued whjIst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the who1e of the lale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Toumefort gives a long accourit in hif travels of several astonlshing cases of vampyrism, to whichbe pretonds to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subjecl, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has pvt forth some learned di\u017fsertations, tending to prove it to he a ela\u017fsical, as well as barbarian error.\nMariy curious and iriteresting riotices on this singularly horrible superftition mlght be added; thougb lhe present may susfice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted lo explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the terin Vampyre is the one in most general acoeplation, there ore several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &e.\nTHE VAMPYR E.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon cl London winter, there appeared at the various partios of tbe lcaders of the lon a nableman, more remorkable for his singularities, than his rank. He ga2ed upan the mirth around him, as if he could n0t participate therein. Apparently, the lighl laughter of the fair only attracted his attentjon, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breast\u017f where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who feIt this sensalion of awe, could n0t explajn whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixjrig upon the object's face, did not seem lo penetrate, and at one glance topierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fe1l upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skin it could not pass. Hlf peculiarities caused him t0 be inuited to every hovse; all wished to see hiin, and those who had beeri accuslamed to vioIent excitemenl, and now feIt the weight of ennui, were pleased at havlng something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gajned a warmer tint, either from the b1ush of modesty, or from tbe strong emotion of passlon, thaugh its form and 0utliric wore heautiful, many of the fernalc hunters aftcr notorlety attempted to win his clttentions, and gain, at 1east, some markf of what they might term affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the mockery of every rnonstcr shewn in drawing-roorns since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all hut put ari the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she staod before hjm, though hiseyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014everi her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But tbough the common adultress could not influence even the guidance af his eyes, it was not thal the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet suob was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife clnd innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressedhimself to females. Ho had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whetber it was that it even overcame the drcad of his singular cbaracter, or tbat they were moved by hif apparent hotred of vice, he was as ofteri clmong those females who form the boast of their sex from lheir domestic virlues, as omong those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there oame to London a young gentleman of the name of Avhrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in thc possession of great weallh, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by gvardians, wha thought it their duty morely ta take care of his fortune, wbile they relinquished the more important charge of his mlnd to the carc of mercenary subalterris, be cultivated more his irnaginalion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so mariy milliners' apprentices. He believed all lo sympathise with virtue, and thought tbatvice was lhrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as wo fee in romances: he thought that the ini\u017fery 0f a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patehes. He thought, ln fine, that the dreamf of poets werethe recllities of life. He wcls handsome, frank, ond rich: sor tbese reafons, upon his enlering int0 the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least trvth their langujshing or romping favourites: the daughters at lhe sarnc time, by their brigbtening couritenances when he approached, and by their sparklirig eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notlons of his talenls and his merit. Altached as he was lo tbe romarice of his solitary hovrs, he was startled al finding, that, except in the tallow and wax eandles that flickered, nol from the prosence os a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congories of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, hawever, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him inhis career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himsolf, who gave few other signs of his obsorvotiori of external objects, than the taclt assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their cantact: allowing hif imagination to picture every tbing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this obiect into tbe hero of a romance, ond determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rclther than the person before him. He became acquainted witb him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upan his notice, that his presence was always recogniscd. He gradua1ly learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairswero embarrassed, clnd soonfovnd, from the notes of preparalion in \u2014 Street, that he was ab0ut to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting thi\u017f singular character, wbo, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him t0 perform the lour, which for many genorations has becn thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapld steps iri the career of vice towards pulting themselves upan an equalily with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasanlry or of praise, clccording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioriing his intontions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised ta receive from him a praposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of este em from him, wba, apparently, had nothing in common with other meri, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling wat ers.\nHitherto, Aubrey hcld hadno opportunity of stvdying Lord Ruthvcn's character, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were expo\u017fed to hif view, the results offered different conclusions fr0m the apparent motivcs to his conduct.His companion was prafuse in his liberality;\u2014the idlc, tho vagabond, and the beggar, received fr0m his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunes attendant even upan virtue, that he bestowed hjs alms;\u2014lhese werc scnt from the door with hardly \u017fuppressod sncers; but when tbe profljgate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow hlm to walIow in his lust, or lo sink hiin still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rieh charlty. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which genera1ly prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtvous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity 0s his Lordship, which was still more impres\u017fed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot lhcre was a curse up0n it, for they were all oilher led to the scaffold, ar sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns tbraugh which they passed, Aubrey was surprized al the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the oentres of al1 fashionable viee; there he entered into all the spirlt of the faro table: he betted, and always garnbled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonisl, and then he last even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging faee, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he cncountered the ra\u017fh youthful novice, or tbe luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014t-\nhi\u017f apparent abstractcdriess of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, tom from the circIe he ador ned, cvrsing, in the solilude of a dungeon, the fole that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry childron, wit hout a slnglc farthing of his Iate immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient lo satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gombling toble; but immediately lo\u017ft, to lhe ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convuIsive grasp of the inriocent: this might but be lhe result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the ounning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg hirn to resign that chority and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him fome opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; howeucr, this never occurred. Lord Ruth-\nven in his carriage, and amidst tbo various wild arid rich \u017fcenes of noture, was always lho same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; and though Aubrey was near tbe object of his curiosity, he oblainod no groater gratification fr0m it than the constont excitement os vainly wishing to break thal mystery, which to his exaltod imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he lefl him in daily atten dance upon the morning olrclc of cln Italian countess, whilst he went in se aroh 0f the memor-\nials of another almost deferted city. Whilst he was thvs engaged, Ietters orrived from England, whioh be opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathlng nothing hut affection; the others werc from his guardians, the lclt tor aslonished hlm; if it had before entered into his imagination thal there was an evil power resident in his companion,these seemed to give him sufficiont rea\u017fon for the 6e1ief. His guardians insisled upon his immcdialely Ieaving hls sriend, and urged, that his characler was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrcsislible powers of seduction, rendered his lieentious habits more dangerous to society.It had been discouered, that his contempt for tbe adultresf had not originated iri hatred of her character; bul that he had required, to enhance his gratlfication, thal hls victim, the partrier of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vjrtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently onaccount of their virtue, had, sincc hif departure, thrown even the mask aside, clnd had not fcrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the pvblic gaze.\nAubrey detormined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright poirit on which to rest tho eye. He resolved lo invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hirn a1together, purposing, in tho mean while, to wateh him more clasely, and to let rio sligbt circumstarices pass by unnoticod. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship wclf endeavouring to work upon the inexpcrience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, jt js seldom that an unmarried female is mot with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry ori his plans insccret; but Aubrey's eye followod him in all hjs windings, arid soon discavered that an assig-\nnation had 6een appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innoeent, thaugh thoughtless girI. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and a6ruptly asked hjm his intentlons with respect to the lady, informinghim at the same time that be was aware of his 6eing abovtt0 meet her that very nigbl. Lord Ruthven onswered, that hisintentions were such as he svpposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pre\u017fsed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Au6rey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that rnoment he must deeline accompanying hls Lordsbip in the remainder 0f their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and callirig upon the mother os the lady, informed her of aIl he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but olfo concernirig the character of his Lordshjp. The assignation waf prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servont to notify hi\u017fcamplete ossent t0 a separation; but did not hlnt clny suspicion of bis plaris having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Periinsula, soon found himself at Athens. He thcn fixed his residence in the house of a Grcek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monumenls that opparent1y, ashamed of cbronicling the deeds of srecmon 0nly 6efore slaves, had hidden thomselves beneatb the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicatc, that she might bave formcd the modol for a painter wi\u017fhing to pourlray on canvass the prornised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradi\u017fe, save that her eyes spoke too much mirid for any one to think she could belong ta those wh0 had no souls. As she dancod upon theplain, or lripped along tbe mountain's si de, one wovld hauc thought the gazeIle a p0or type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for that sleepy Iuxurious look of the animal sultod butto the laste of ariepicure. Tho light step of Ianthe often acoomporiied Aubrey in his search after anliquities, and often would the unconsciaus girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly,show the whole beauty of her sorm, floating as it were upon the wind, lo the eager gaze 0f him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an a lmost effaced lablet, jn the contemplalion of her sylph-like figure. Oft en would her tresses falling, as she flitted arourid, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicatelybrilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the fargelfulness 0f the antiquary, wholet escape from bis mind the very object hc had before thought os vjtal importance to the proper interpretation of cl passage in Pausanias. Bvt why atlempt to describe chorms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014Il was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remairis of which he wished to preservea mcmorial sor his futurehours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of hi\u017f pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would theri describe to him thc circling darice upon the operi plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours os youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, w0uld tell hirn all the supernatural tales of ber nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled the interest even of Avbrey; and often as she told hjm the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prol0ng his exiftence for the ensuing months, his b lood would ruricold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the namos of old men, wbo had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appelile; and when \u017fhe faund him so incredulous, she begged of him lo believe her, f0r it had been, remarked, lhat thase who had dared ta question their exiftence, always had some proof given, whieh obliged lhem, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional oppearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description ofLord Ruthven; he, however, still persi\u017fted iri persuading her, that therc could be no lrutb jn herfears, tbough at the same tirne he wondered at the many colricidences which had all tendedto excitc a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to ottclch himself moro and more to Ianthe; her i nnocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wori his heart; ond while he ridlculed the idea of cl yaung man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he fovnd himself more and more attached ta the almost fairy form before him. He wouId tear himself at times from her, and, forming o plan far some antiquarian resoarch, ho would dopart, determjncd nal to return until his object was attained; but he always found jt impossible to fix his attentiori upon the ruins clround him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful p0ssessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconsciaus of his lovc, and was ever lhe same frank infantile 6eirig he had first known. Sbe always seemed to part froin him with rcluctancc;but it was because \u017fhe had no 1onger any one with whom she could visit her fovourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet efcaped the destructive hand of time. She had appea1ed to her parents on the subject of Vampyre\u017f, and they both, witb several present, offjrmed thelr existence, pale with horror al the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, wbich was to detain him for a few bours; when they beard lhe name of the place, they all at orice begged of him not to return at nighl, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upon any con\u017fidercltion. They described it asthe resort os the vampyre\u017f in their nocturnal orgies, ond deriounced the m0st heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Au brey made light of their represontations, and triedto laugh them ovt of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, thevery namc of whlch apparently inade their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncb0ly face of his host, and was concerned to fjnd that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came t0 the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere nighl allowed the powerof these beings to bc put in action;\u2014he promiscd. He wcls, howevor, so occupied in his research, that he did nol percejve thot day-light wou ld soon end, and lhat in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmcr climates, so rapidly gather inlo a tremendous ma\u017fs, and pour all their ragc upon the dev0ted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: andere he had advclnced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an iriterval of roft\u2014lls thick hoavy rain forced ils way througb the canopying foliage, whllst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse toak fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity tbrougb the oritangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by tbe glare of llghtning, tbat he was in the neighbovrhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itfelf up sroin the masses of dead leaves and brushwood wh ich surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hopjng to find some one to guide him to the town, or at loast trusting to obtainshelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approachcd, lhe thunders, far a moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful fhrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one a1mast unbroken sound;\u2014he was stclrtled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effart, forced open the door of lho hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the\u017found, bowever, gvided him. He was apparently unperceivcd; for, thougb he called, still the sounds c0ntinued, and no notice was taken of him. He fourid himfelf in contact with some one, wh0m he iinmediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to whicb a laudlaugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whosestrength seemed superhumcln: determjned lo sell his life as dearly as he could, he strugglod; but il was in vain: ho was lifted from his feet and hurled wilh enormous force against the ground:\u2014hi\u017f enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hclnds up0n his throat\u2014when tbe glare of many torches penetrating lhraugh the hole that gave ljght irithe day, disturbed him;\u2014he instaritly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashingof the branches, as ho hrokc through the woad, was no longer beard. The storm was now still; arid Aubrey, incapable of moving, was foon heard by those without. They eritered; the light of their lorches fell upon the mud w alls, and the thatch loaded on every individual strclw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was agajn left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the lighl af the torches once mare burst upon him, to perceive the ajry form 0f his fair co nductress brought in a lifeless corsc. He shul his eyes, hoping thclt jt was but a vision arising from his disturbed imaginatjon; but he again saw thc same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet tbere was a stillness aboul her fclce that seerned almost asattaching as the life that once dwelt therc:\u2014upon her neek and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to thif the meri pointed, crylng, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quicklyformed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately 6een to bim the objcot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower af life that had died within her. He kncw not what his thougbts were\u2014hif mind was benvmbed arid secmed to shunreflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular c0nstruction, whlch had been fourid in the hvt. They were soon met 6y differenl partios who had been engaged in thc search of her whom a mothor had missed. Their lamenta6le cries, af thcy approached the eity, forewarned lhe parents of some dreadful oatastrophe. \u2014Ta describe their grief would be impo\u017fsible; but when they oscertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corfe. They wcre iriconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put lo bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was 0ften dollrious; in these intervals he would cclll upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccouritablo combinati0n he seemed to beg of his former companion t0 spare the being he loved. At other tirncs he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, ond curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time ta arrive at Athens, and, from whatever inotive, upon hearing of the ftate of Aubrey, immediately placedhim\u017felf in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When thelatter rec0vered srom his delirium, he was horrified and slartled at the sight of hiin whose image hehad now combined witb that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, implying a1most repentanco for the fault thot had caused thelr separation, and slill more by the attention, clnxiety, and care wh ich he showed, \u017foon rec0nciled him to his presenco. His lordship seomed quite changed; he no longcr appeared lhat apathetic beingwho had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as hjs convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, clnd Aubrey pereoived na differcnce from the former man, except that at times he was surprised lo meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of rnalicious exvltation playing up0n hls lips: bc kriew not why, but lhis smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recouery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in wotching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, ar in marking the progress of those orhs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat elasticity of spirit which had once so distiriguisbed him now scemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mirid could not find it in the nejghbourhood of Athen\u017f; if he sougbt it ainidst tbe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if ho sougbt it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of tho modest violet; then sudderilyturnjng rovnd, would show, to his wild imagiriation, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature os which crealed such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care hc had taken of hlm during his illness, that they fhould visit those parts of Greece neilher hod yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought e very spot ta which a rccollectiori could be attclched: but though they thus hastened from place ta place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight lhese reports, whicb they imagined were only the lnvontion of individuals, whose interest it was to excjte the generosjly of those whoin they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a descnce. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock br0ught down from the neighhouring precipjces, they had reason lo reperit their negligence; for s carcely were thewhole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, wheri lhey were startled by the whist1ing of buIlets close to their hcads, arid by the echoed report of severaI gunf. In an jnstant their guardf had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report camc. Lord Rulhuen and Aubrey, jmitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shcltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of heing thus detained by o foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to urirosisting slaughter, if any of the ro6bers should climb ab oue and take them jn the reclr, they delermined at once t0 rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly hod they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven receiued a shat in the shoulder, wbich brought him to tho ground. Aubrey haslened to his assjstance; and, no longer heoding thc contesl orhls awn perll, wa\u017f soon surprised by seeing the robbers' foces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthuen's beirig woundcd, immediately thrown up their arms and surrenderod.\nBy promises of great rcward, Aubrey soon indvced thom to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thelr presenco\u2014tbey b eing conterit merely to guard the entrance till their comradc should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveri's strenglh rapidly decrease d; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed aduancing with hasty stcps. His con ducl and appearance hod not changed; he seeined a\u017f uncon\u017foiousof pain as he had been of the objeots a6oulhim: but towards thc close of the lclst evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eye ofton sixed upon Aubrey, who was induccd lo offer his assistance with more thcln usual earnestnefs\u2014\"Assist me! you rnay save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my Ilfc, I heed the death of rny existence af little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's h0nour.\"\u2014\"H0w? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but Iittle\u2014my life ebbs apoce\u2014I cannot explain the whale\u2014but if yov wouId conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's inouth\u2014and if my death were unknawn for some lime in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raislng himself witb exultanl uiolence, \"Swear by all yovr soul revere s, by all your nature foarf, swear that, for a year and a day you will nol impart your knawledge of my criines or dcath to ony livi ng being in any way, whalover may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed 6ursting from their sockets: \"I swcclr!\" sald Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his inind, and he knew not wby; when be remembered his oatb a cold shivering came over hirn, as if from the presentjment of somcthing horrible awaiting bim. Rising eorly in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and iriformed him tbat it was no longer there, havlng been canveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to lhe pinnacle 0f a neigbbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should bc exposed to the firsl cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonifhed, and taking several of lbe men, determined to g0 and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, wheri he had m0unted to the sumrnit ho found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on whicb they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildercd in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burjed tbe corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a eounlry in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in wbich oll apparently c0n\u017fpired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had sei2ed upon his mind, be resolved to leave it, and saon arrlved at Smyrna. Whjle waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranlo, or to Naples, he occupied himself in ar rariging those effects he had with him belonging la Lord Rvthven. Amongft other things there was a case containing several weapons of offenee, more or less adapted to ensure lhe death of the victiin. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turnirig them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently ornamented in thc same stylo a\u017f lhe dagger discovered lri the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain furlher pro0f, he found the weopon,and bis horror may be imagined when hc discovered that il fitted, though pecvliarly sbaped, the sheath hoheld in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no surther certairity\u2014they seemed gazing to be 6ound ta the dagger; yet still he wifhed to djsbelieue; but tbe particular form, the same varying tirits upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and lest no room for doubt; there wcro alsa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had atlernpted to snatoh from Lord Ruthven'f seductive arts. Her parents were indistress, their fortvne ruined, and she had not been beard of since the departure of his I0rdship. Aubroy's mlnd became almoft broken under so many repeated horrorf; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urgirig the speed of the poftilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breoze, which seemed abedient to hls will, soon wafted him tothe Englisb shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fothers, and there, f0r a momerit, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caressef of his \u017fister, all memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his offeotion, now that the womari began to appear, she wa\u017f stilI more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There wos rione of that Iight brilliancy whicb only exists ln theheated atmosphere of a crowdod apartment. Her blue eye was ncver lit up by the levlty of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about il which did not seem to clrisc srom missorlune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicato a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her ftep was not that light footing,which strays where'er a bulterfly or a colourmay altract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was nevor brightened by the smile os joy; but when her brother brealhed toher his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs sbe knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her sinile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if thase eyes,\u2014that facc were then playing in the light of their own native spherc. She was yet only eigbteen, and had not been prescnted to the world, it having beeri thought by ber guardians more sit that hor presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, wben he might be her pratectar. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which wasfa\u017ft approaching, shauld be the epoch of bereritry into thc \"busy scene.\" Aubrey wou1d rather have remoinod in tbe mansion of his fathers, and fcd upon lhe melancholy which overpowered him. He could riot feel inlerest clbout tho frivalities os fashionahle strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he hod witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own cornfort to the protectiori of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the nexl day, which had been announeed asa drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a 1ong time, and all who were clnxious to hask in the smi1e of roya1ty, hastened thither. Aubroy was thcro with his sister. While he was standingin a corner by him\u017fels, heedles\u017f of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthuen was in thatvery place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly eourage to turn, fearfu1 of seeing a spectre that would b last him, when he peroeived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into fociety. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weighl, he wasobliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through tho crowd, he threw himself into his earriage, and was driven home. Ho paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthvcn again besore him\u2014circumstanccs starled up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014thc dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image bis mind was rosting upon. It was impossible that it could be reol\u2014he determined, theresore, to go again into society; for though hoatlompted to ask concernirig Lord Ruthven, tho name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed iri gaining information. He went a few nights after wjth hi\u017f sister to the assembly of a near rclati0n. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retjred into a recess, and tbere gaue hlmself up to his own devouring tboughts. Perceiving, at last, lhat many were leaving, he roused hjmself, and enterjng another room, found his sister \u017furrounded by several, apparently in oarnest c0nversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when 0ne, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized hl\u017f sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wailing for their lords; and whi1e he was engaged in passing them, hc again heard that voice whispcr close to him\u2014\"Reinember your oath!\"\u2014Ho dld nol dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey hecamc almost distracted. Ifbefore his mind bad been absorhcd by one subject, how much rnore completely was it engrosscd, now that the certainty as the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His siste-\nr's attenti0ns were now unheeded, and it was ln vain lhat she intreated him ta explain to her what had caused his abrupt c0nduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam,bearjng ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not averl its progress? His very sister might have been louched by him. But euen if he were to brook hjs oath, ond disclose hif suspjeion\u017f, whowould believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world froin such a wretch; but deatb, he remembered, had been already m0cked. For days hc remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw na one, and ate only when hjs sjstcr came, who, with oyes ftreaming with teors, bosought him, for her sake, to support naturc. At last, no longer capable of bearjng stillnessand solitvde, he left his house, roamed fram street to streot, anxious lo fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wondored, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to thomidnigbt damps. He was no longer to be rocagnized; al first he roturned with the evenlng to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious f0r hif safety, employed people to foll0w him; but they were s0on dlstanced by him who fled from a pursucr swifter lhan any\u2014srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck wilh the idea that hc 1efl by his absencc tbe wholo of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of who\u017fe presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiovs to forewarn, iri fpite of his oath, alI whom Lord Ruthven approached with lntimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, hjs inward shudderings so visible, that his sister wos at lastobliged to beg os him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society whlch affected him so strongly. When, bowever, remonstrance proved unavailjng, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, feclr-\ning that his mind was becoming olienated, they thought it high time to resume again thclt tru\u017ft which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDe\u017firous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dajly encountered jn his wanderings, and of preveriting him from exposing to the general eye those marks of whot they c0nsidered solly, they ongaged a physician to residein the bouse, and take constanl care of him. He hardly appcared to notice it, so completeIy wa\u017f his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His inooherence becaine at last so great, thot he was confined to bis chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of 6eing roused. He had become emaciated, bis eyes had attclined a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remclining displayed itself upon the entry of bis sistcr; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing ber hands, with looks that seuerely asflicted her, he would desire her not to touch hiin. \"Oh, do not touchhim\u2014if your love sor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, h0wever, she inquirod to whom he referred, his onIy answer wos, \"True! trve!\" arid again he fank into a slate, whence not even fhe could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences beoame less frequent, and his mind threw osf a portj0n of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, lhclt several times in the day he would oount upon his firigers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the yeclr, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy clrcumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister wos going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attentlon was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this inark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of tho Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still moreby his expressing his intention to be present at lhe nuptiols, and desjring to see his sister. They answered not, but iri a fcw minutes hissister was wilh him. He was apparently again capob1e of being offecled by the influence of her love1y fmile; f0r he pre\u017fsed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He 6egan to speak witb all his wonted warmth, and to congratvlate her upon her marriage with a person s0 disliriguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a 1ocket upon her breast; opening it, what wos bis \u017furprise at beholding lhe featuref of the monster wbo had so long influonced his llfe. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, andtramplcd it under soot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he lookod as if he did nol uriderstand her\u2014then seizing her harids, arid gazing on her with afrantio expressiori of covntenance, he bade ber swear that she wauld never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could n0t advance\u2014it seomed af if that voicc again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned svdderily r0und, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardi ans and physician, who had heard the whole, and thoughl this was but a return of his disorder, enlered, and sorcing him from Mis\u017f Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon hjs knees to them, he implored, he begged os them to delay but sar onc day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined bad taken possesslori of his mind, endeavoured to pacify bim, and retired.\nLord Ruthvcn had callcd the morning after the drawing-roam, and had been refuscd with euery one else. When he heard os Aubrey's ill hoalth, ho readily understood hlmself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that ho was dcomed insane, his exultatiori and pleasure covld hardly beconcealed from those among whom he had gairied this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by con\u017ftant attendance, and the pretence of great affeetion far the brother and jnlerest in his fate, be gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wh0 could resist his power? Histonguc had dangers ond toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, fave with her to whom he addressod himself;\u2014could tell how, sincc he knew her, bis existence, had hegun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thclt he might Iisten to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpcnt's art,or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at longth to him, he obtained an important embclssy, which served as an excvse for ha\u017ftening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to takeplace the very day beforehis departure for the continent.\nAubrey, whon he was left by the physieian and his guardian\u017f, attempted to bribe tbc scrvants, but in vclin. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, af she valuedher own happiness, hor own honour, ond the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few h0urs that mclrriage, on which he den0unced the most heavy curses. The servant\u017f promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he th0ughl it hetternot to hclrass any more tbe mind of Miss Avbrey by, what ho considered, lhe ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the bu\u017fy inmates of the bouse; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than doscribed, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriclges brokc vpon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tho curiosity of the servants at Iast ouercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving hjm in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized lhe opportunlty, with one bound was out of the roam, and in a moment fovnd hjmself in the apartment where all were nearly ossembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his clrm by force, hvrried him from the r0om, spcechless wlth rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, ond know, if not my bride today, yaur sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his altendants, who, roused by the old womon, hcld come in search of him. Aubrey could no longcr support himself; his rage not finding vont, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was canveyed to bed. This was not menti0ned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriogc was salemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness iriorea\u017fed; the effvsion of blood produced symptoms of tho near approach of death. He desired his sjster's guardians might be oal1ed, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the r eader has perused\u2014he died immedicltely after.\nThe guardlans hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but whon they arrived, lt was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, clnd Aubroy's sister had gIutted tbe thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORDBYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before hjm,wherc lo choo\u017fe bis place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through thc Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, wc put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island 0f that naine. The beauty of this place, and the ccrtain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be hod there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmeri; and though it lios rather out of lbe trclck for ship\u017f bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of thc bay, and whilst the men were employed in watcring, and the purser bargainingfar cattle wilh the nati-\nves,lhe clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave ca1led Homer's School, and other p1aces, where we had been before. On lhe brow ofMount Ido (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who to1d us he had come from Scio with an English lor d, who left the island four days previous to aur arrival in his felucco. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\"sajd the Grcek, \"and would have taken me witb hiin; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He wcls an odd, but a very good man. The cotlage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to hirn, and he has left an oId man iri oharge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for jt, ( aboul L250 English currency,) and has resided there ab0ut fourteen months, lhough not constantly; for he saiIf in his felucca vcry oftcn to the different islclnds.\"\nThis account excited our curjosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our cauntryman bcld resided. We were kindly roceiued by an ald man, wbo condueted us over the mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-fIoor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sittirig parlour, and a bod-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply docorated: plain green-slained wal1s, marble tables on either side, a lorge rnyrtle in the oentre, and a small fouritain beneath, which could bemade to play through the branches by rnoving a spring fixed in the sidc of a smaIl branze Venus in a leaning posture; a large coucb ar sofa completed tho furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen Engljsh carie chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirro rs, nor o single painting. The bcdchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we abserved a morble recess, formerly, tbe old man told us, filled with books and papors, whioh were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but wedid riot think our selves jvstified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess 1ay Voltoire'\u017f, Sbakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousscau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Ernpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kot2ebue's novels; Schiller's play af the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Losl, an Italian edilion, printed at Parma jn1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, bul no English book of any description. Most of these bookswere siIled wilh margi-\nnal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian clnd Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe old man \u017faid: \"The lord had 6een reading thesc books the evening hefore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otbers; but,\" said he, \"tbere they must lie unlil his return; for he is so particular, thot wore I t0 move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a servlce; and I have the produce of this farm f0r the trouble of tclking cclre ofit, except twerity zcchlnes which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides jn a sinall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brougbthere from Adrianop1e; I don't kn0w for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the bouse externally was ploasing. The p0rtico in front was fifty paces long clnd fourtecn broad, and the fluted marble pillars with hlock plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now custoinclry in Grecian architecture,) were considerab1y higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong c0arse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings iri smoking, drlnking light wines, such as \"lachrymcl christi,\" eoting fruit, clnd enjoying the evening bree2e.\nOn the left hand as we entered the hausc, asmal1 streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe seal with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on whlch we were told, the lord pclssed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" sor he was very devovt, \"and always attended our ehurch twico a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be lermed \"a bird's-eyo view.\" A line os ricb vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered wlth olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A sinall stream issuing from the ruins descended iri broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea sm00tb as glass, clnd an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, le rminates the view in front; and a little on the left, throvgh a vi sta 0f lofty chesnut and pa1m-trees,feveral small iflands wore distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots af emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enqviries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solltude: none knew bis name but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Candja. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, bvt on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of thc isolated lord. He had portioned cighl young girls when he was last upon the islclnd, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. Hc gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these art-\nicles. He also bought a now boat for a fishermanwho bad lost his own in a gale, arid he often gave Greek Te\u017ftarnents to the poor children. In sbort, he appeared to us, fram all we collected, to havc been a very eccerilric arid benevalent charaoter. One circumstance we learnt, wbich our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclo\u017fe. He had a most beclutiful daughter, with whom the lord was often scen walking on the sea-shore, and he had boughl her a piano-fortc, and taught her himself the use os it.\nSuch was the iriformation with which we departod from the peaceful isle of Milylene; aur imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Grecce could be. He had rnoney il was evident: he had pbilanthropy of disposition, and all tbose eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrjved at Palermo, all our doubts were dispclled. Fal1ing in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arehitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels an tbe island of Tenedos, and I also visitcd him at Mitylene.\" Wc had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we hcld been some years from home; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put into our hands we recognized lho recIuse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been morc curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idecl of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to hi\u017f lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandcred. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposjlion, averse lo associating wilh human nature, or contributing in any way to saoth its \u017forrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact ls directly the reverse, cls may be plainly gathered from these Iittle anecdotef. All the finer feclings of the hoart, so elegantly depioted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and chclrlty appear to gulde all his actions: and his courtirig the repofe of salitude is an addltional reason sormarking him as a being ori whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Berievolence bath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. Wilh respecl to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opiniori. Reports are ever to be received with ca ulion, particulorly when directed against man's mora1 integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where cllI must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's cbaracter is worthy of hif genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testjmony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, FIeet-street.","37":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Williain Polidorl\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is sounded if very general in the East. Among tbe Arabianf il oppears to be common: it dld not, howeuer, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establi\u017fhmerit of Christianily; clnd it has only assumed its present forin since the division of tbe Latin and Greek churches; at wbich time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latiri body could not eorrupt if buried ln their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from thejr graues, and feeding vpon tho blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrcline, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of tbeir victims, who became emaciated, lost th eir strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fclttened\u2014and thejr v eins became disterided to such a state of repletion, as to cause thc blood to flow frorn all the passages of th eir bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiouf, and, of coursc, crediblc accounl of a particuIar case of vampyri\u017fm, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examjnation of tho c0mmander-in-chief and magistrales of the plclce, they positively and unanjmously affirmed, that, about five years 6efore, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, thot, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had fourid a way ta rid bimself of the evil, by eating some of lhe earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his bIood. This precaution, bowever, did not prevent him frorn becomlng a varnpyre bimself; for, about twentyor lhlrty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormentcd by him, and a depositian was made, that fovr perfons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, lhe inhabitants hauing corisulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) sresh, ond entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid 6lood. Proof having been thus ohtained, tbey resorted to the accustomed remedy. A slclke was drjvcn entirely through the he art and hody of Arnold Paul, at which he is reportod to bave cried out as dreadfu1ly as if he had bcen alive. Thls dorie, thoy cul off his head, burned his bady, and threw the ashesinto bis grave. The same measures were adoptcd with lhe c0rses of those personswho had preuiously died from vampyrifm, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universol beliof is, that a porson sucked by a vampyre 6ecomes a vampyre himself, and sucksin his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relaled, because it seems belter adapted to jllustrate the subject of the prescnt observations thcln any other instance which could ho adduced. In many parts of Greecc it is considered as a sort of punishrnent after death, for some heinous crime commilted wbilst in existenco, that the deceased ls not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled t0 confine his infernal visitations \u017folely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A suppasition alluded to in tbo \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serit, Thy corse shall fram its tornb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native plaee, And suck lhe blood of al1 thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the slrcain of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere lhey yet expire, Shollknow the demon for their fire; As cvrsingthee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withcred on the stcm. But one that for thy crime must faIl, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall 6less thee wilh a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap tby heart in flarne! Yet thou must eridthy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the Iast gIassy glance must view Which freezes o'or its lifeless blue; Then with urihallowed hand \u017fhall tear The tresses of her ycllow bair, Of which, jn life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best bl0od sball drip; Thy gnasbing toolh, and haggard lip; Then stalking to lhy suIlen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these jn horror shrink awoy From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. S0uthey has aIso intr0ducod in his wild but beautiful poem os \"Thalaba,\" the vainpyre corse of the Arabian maid Onei2a, who is rcpresented as hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him \u017fhe besl loved whilst in existencc. But thjs cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of hcr life, she being pourtrayed throvghout the whole of the tale as a complele type of purity and innocen ce. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of severa1 astonlshing cases of vampyrifm, to which he prelends ta have been on eyewilness; and Calmet, in his great w0rk upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives iIlustrative of its effects, has put forth some leorned dissertations, tending lo prove it to be a classical, as well a\u017f barbarian error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices on this singularly borrible superstition might be added; though lhe present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, arid which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that lhough the term Vampyro is the ane in inost general acceptation, there are several others synonymous wilh it, made use of in vclrious parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened thot in tbe midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the vari0us parties of the leaders of tbe ton a n0bleman, more remarkablo for his \u017fingulclrities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth arovnd him, as if he could not pclrticipate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the falr orily attracted his attentiori, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it aros e: s0me attributed it to the dead grey eye, whieh, sixirig up0n the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward workingf of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon tho skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; aIl wisbed to see hirn, and those who had been accustomed to vi0lent excitcmerit, and now selt the weighl os onnui, were pleased at having something in their presence capclble of engagirig their attention. In spile of the deadly bue of his facc, which neuer gairied a warmer tlnt, cither from the blvsh of modesty, 0r from the strong emotion of passlon, though its form and outljne were beautlful, many of the female huriters afler notoriety attempted lo win his attontion\u017f, and gain, at least, some inorks of what they might term affcction: Lady Mercer, who had been theinockery os evcry monster shewn ln drawing-roomf \u017fince hcr marriage, threw berself ln his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attraet his notice:\u2014lhough in vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparenlly fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they wore unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the fleld. But thovgh the common aduItress could not influenco even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was jndif ferenl to him: yet such was the apparent coutlon with which he spokc to the virtuouf wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to femalcs. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whetherit was that it even overeame the dread of his singuIclr cbaracter, or that they were moved by his clpparent hatred of vice, be wos as often omong tho\u017fe females wh0 form the boast of t heir sex srom their domestic virtues, as among those wh0 sully it by thelr vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in cbiIdhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thovgbt it their duly merely to take care of his fortune, wbi1e they relinquis hed the more important chargc os his mind to the care of mercenary svbolterns, he cultivaled more his imagination than hj\u017f judgment. He had, hence, lhal high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliriers' apprcntices. He believed a11 to fympathise with uirtue, and thoughl that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque offect of the scerie, a\u017f we see in romances: he thought that the misery os cl cottage merely consisted iri the vesting of clothes, which were aswarm, but which were better adapted to the palnter's eye by theirirregular folds ond vclrious coloured patches. He thought, in fine, lhat the dreams of poels were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his cntering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which shouId describe with least truth their languishing orromping savourites: the daughters al the same time, by their brjghtening couritenances when he approclched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened hjs lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merjt. Attached as he was to the r0mance of his solitary hours, he was start1ed at flnding, that, cxcept in the tallow and wax candles thot flickered, not from the prosence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any af that congeries of pleasing pictures and descrlptions containcd in those volumes, from which he had formed his sludy. Findlng, however, s0me compensation in his gratisied uanity, he was about lo relinquish his dreams, when tho extraordinary being we have above described, orossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, thcln the tclcit assent lo their existence, implied by the auoidance of thoir oantact: allowing his imagjnation t0 picture every thirig that f1attered its propon\u017fity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed tbis object into the hero of a romclnce, and determined to ob\u017ferve the offspring of his fancy, rather than tho person before him. He became acquairited with him, paid him atteritions, and so far advanced vp0n his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He groduolly learnt that Lord Rvlhven's affairs wore emborrafsed, and soon sound, from tbe notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was aboul to travel. Desirous of gajning some information respecling thj\u017f singular charaeter, who, tlll riow, had on1y whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him lo perform the tour, which for many generations has beon thought necessary to enclble lhe young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equaI ity witb the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if faIleri from the skies, whenever scandalous inlrigues are ment ioned as the subjects 0f pleasantryor of praise, according lo the degreo of skill fhewn in carryingthein on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his lritcntions to Lord Ruthven, was surprifed to receiuefrom hirn a prop0sal to join him. Flottered 6y such a mark of esteem from him, who, apporently, had nothing in common with other men, he glcldly occepted it, and in a few days they had passcd tbe circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had n0 opportunity of studying Lord Ruthuen's character, and now hc found, lhat, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered disferent coricluslons from the apparont motives to his conduct. His eompanlon was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, thc vagabond, and the beggar, received srom his hand more tban enough to relieve tbcir immediate wants. But Aubrey could riot avold remarking, lhat it wos not upon the virtuauf, reduced to indigcnce by the mlsfortunes attendclnt even upon virtue, lhat he bestowcd his alms;\u2014tbese were sent from the doar with hardly suppressed sneer s; but when the profligate came to ask something, not ta relleve his wants, but toallow him to wallow in his lu\u017ft, or to sinkbim still deeper in bis iniquity, be was sent away witb rich charity. This was, bowcver, atlributed by him to the greater importunity of tbe vicjous, which generalIy prevalls over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thero wa\u017f one circumstance about the charity of hi\u017f Lordship, which was still morc imprefsed upan his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and olher towns through wh icb thoy passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerriess with which his companion fought for the centres of all fashionoble vice; lhere he eritered into all the spirit of the faro lable: he betted, and always gambledwith success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and theri he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unehangjrig face, with whicb he generally watched the society arovnd: it was not, however, so when he encountered lhe rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then hls very wish seemed fort-\nune's law\u2014this apparent abstrclctednesf of mind was 1aid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilstdollying with the half-dead mouse. In every lown, hc left the formerly affluent youth, t0rn from lhe circle he adorned, cursing, in the solilude of a dvngeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst rnany a father sat frantic, amidst the spoaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, whcrewith to huy evcn sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, tbe last gilder he had just snatchcd from the convulfive grasp of the innocerit: this might hut be the result of a ccrtain degreeof knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more exporienced. Aubrey often wisbed to reprefent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleafure which provedthe ruin os all, and did not tend to hjs own proflt;\u2014but he deloyed it\u2014for eacb day he hopod hisfriend wovld give him somc opporturiity af speaking frankly and opcnly to him; h0weuer, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in hiscarriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenesof nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid though Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, be oblained no greater gratification from it than the conftant excitement 0f voinly wishing to break that mystery, whicb to his exalted imaginationbegan to assume the appearance of sometbing supernaturaI.\nThey soon arrived at Rame, and Aubrey for atime lost sight of his companion; he left him iri daily attendance upon the marning circle os an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials 0f another almo\u017fl desertod city. Whil\u017ft he was lhus engaged, letters arrivod from England, which he operied with eagor impatience; the first was frorn his sister, breathing nothing bvt affectjon; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; is it had before entered irilo his imagination that there was an evil power resjdent in his companion, the se seomed to give him sufficient reason f0r the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that bis character was dreadfully vicious, for that the po\u017fsession of irresistible powcrs of seduction, rendered his liccntious habits more dangerous t0 society. Il bad been discovered, tbat his cantempt for the adul tress bad not 0riginated in hatred of hor charactcr; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his vlctim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urisullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatjon: in fine, thclt aIl thoso females whorn be hod sought, apparently on acoount of their virtue, had, since his departuro, thrown even the mask afide, and had not scruplcd to expose the whole deforinily of their vices to the public gaz e.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, wbose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He rcsolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pvrposing, in the mean while, to watch him inore closely, and to let no slight circvmstances pass by urinoticed. He enlered into the same circle, and soan pcrceived, that his Lordship was endoavouring to work upori the inexperience of the daugbter of the lady whose house he chjefly frequented. In Itoly, it is seldom that an unmarried female is mct with in society; he was theref0re obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Au6rey's oye followed bim iri all his windings, and soon disoouered thclt an assigriation hod becn appojnted, which wouId most ljkely end in the ruin of an inri0cent, th ovgh thoughtless girl. Losirig no time, he entered tho apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his iritentioris with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet hcr thal very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his interitions were \u017fuch as he supposed all would hove upon sucb an occasion; and upon being prefsed whether he intended lo marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediatcly writing a note, to say, that froin that moment he must decIirie aecompanying his Lordshlp in the remainder of lheir proposed tour, he ardered his servant to seek other apartmentf, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of alI he kncw, not only with regord to her daughter, but also coricerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separotion; but did not hint any suspicion of his pIans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving Ieft Rome, Aubrey direeted his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninfula, soon found himself ot Athens. He then fixed his rcside nce in the house of a Greek; and soori 0ccupied himself in tracing the faded records of anciont gl0ry upon monuments that apparently, asbamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before \u017flaues, had bidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under tho same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the modcl for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the f aithful in Mahomet's paradise, save lhat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to thlnk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, orie would havc thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who wauld have exchariged her eyc, apparently the eye of ariimaled natvre, for that sleepy luxurlous lo0k of the animal svited but to tho taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accampanied Aubrey in hissearch after antiquities, and often would the unconsoious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floatjng as it wcre upori the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the lettcrs he had just decypbered uponan almost effacod tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tressos falling, as she flitted arourid, exhiblt in tbe sun's ray svch delicately brilliant and swistly fading hues, it migbl well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who lel escape from his rnind the very object he had before thought of vital iinportance to the proper interpretatlon of a passage in Pausanias. But why clttompl to descrihe charms which all feeI, but none con appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffecled by crowded drawing-rooms arid stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of whioh he wished to preserve a memorial for hjs suture hours, \u017fbe would st and by, and watch the mclgic effects of his pcncil, iri tracing tbe scenes of her nalive place; she would then describe to him the circling dance vpon the open plclin, would paint, to him in all the gl0wing colours of yautbful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewingin her infancy; and lhen, turning to subjects that had evidently made o greater impresfion upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatvral tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparenl belief of what she narrated, exeited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had pa ssed years amidst his friends, and dearost ties, forcedevery year, byfeeding upon the life of a lovely fernale to prolong his existence sor the cnsuing moriths, his hlood would run coId, whi1st he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horriblc fantasies; but Ianthe ciled to hlm thc names of oId men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their riear relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and wheri she found him sa jnoredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those wbo had dored to question thoir exjstcnce, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confe\u017fs it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearclnce of these monfter\u017f, and his horror was lncreosed, by hearing a protty aecvrate descriptian of LordRuthven; he, however, still persisted in persuadlng her, that there could be no truth in her fears, thaugh at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended lo excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey hegan to attach himself morc and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrafted with all the affected virtues of tbe women among whom be had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, mclrry-\ning an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself moreand mare attached to the a1most fairy form before hjm. Hc would tear himself at timos from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquari an re\u017fearch, he would depclrt, determjned not to return until bis objoct was ottained; but he always found it impossible to six his ottention upon lhe rvins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that soemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uncoriscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. Shc always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite havnts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelchingor unoovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destruclive hand os time. She bad appealed to her parents on the subiect of Vampyres, and they b0th, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, palo with horror at the vory name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to praceed upon one of his oxcursions, which was to detajn him for a few hours; wben they heard the nameof tbe placo, tbey all at once hegged of him not to retvrri at nighl, as he must necessarily pass lhrough a wood, wbcre no Greok would euer remain, aftor lhe day had clo sed, upon clny consl deration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nacturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of lheir repre\u017feritations, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he sclw them fhudder at hls daring thus to mock a fuperior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, be was silent.\nNext morning Au6rey set off upon his excursion unattonded; ho was surprised to obsorve the melanoholy face of bis host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired tbem with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed lhe power of lhese beings to be put jn actjon;\u2014ho promjsed. He wa\u017f, however, so occupied in hjs research, that he did not pereejve that day-light would soon end, and tbat in the horizon there wasane of those specks whioh, in the warmer climate\u017f, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon lhe devoled country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined ta make up by speed for his delcly: bul it was too late. Twilight, ln these southorn elimatef, is alm0st unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power os the storm was above\u2014ils echoing thunders had fcarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its wcly tbrough the canopying foliage, whilst tho blue forked lightning seemed to fall clnd radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of ljghtning, lhal he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itselfup from the massos of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find somo one to guide hirn to the town, or at lea\u017ft trusting to oblain sholter frorn thc pelting of the storm. As he approcl ched, tbe thunders, for a momont silent, allowed him lo hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with lhe stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continuod in one alm0st unbrokeri sourid;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by tbe thundor which again rolled over bis head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the but. He fovrid himsels in utter darkne\u017fs: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparontly unperceived; for, thaugh he called, still the sounds continued, and no nolice was taken of him. He sound himself in contact with some one, whom he lmmediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again basfled!\" to whieb a loud laugh succeeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whose strengtbseemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly asbe could, he struggled; bul it was in vain: he was lifted fram bis fect and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw bimself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placod his hands upon hif throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrating through tho bole thclt gave Iight in the day, disturbed hlm;\u2014he inslantly rose, and, leclv-\ning hls prey, rushed through the do or, and in a rnoment the crashing of the branchos, as he broke throughthe wood, was no 1onger hea rd. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of m0ving, was soon heard by thosc without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the inud wallf, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the desire of Aubrey lhey searched for her who had attracted him by her crjes; he wclf agairi left in darkness; but what was his horror, wheri the 1ighl of the torches once more burst upori him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduclress brought in a lifelesf corse. He shut his eyes, hoping tbat it was but a vision arising fram his disturbed imaginatjon; but be again saw the some form, when he unclosed them, strelched by hif side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not evcn upon her Iip; yel there was a stillnefs about her foce that seemed almost as attachlng os the life that once dwelt thcre:\u2014vpon her neck and broast was blood, arid upon her thraat were the marks of teeth having opencd the vein:\u2014to thjs the men poiriled, cryjng, simultaneously strvck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A l itter was qulckly formed, and Aubrey was loid by the fide of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within hcr. He knew not what hif thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed arid seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014ho held almost unconsclously in his hclnd a naked dagger of a particular constructiori, which had been found in lho hut. They were soori met by different parties who hcld been engagcd in thc search of ber whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached lho city, forewclrricd the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. \u2014T0 describe thelr grief wouId be jmpossible; bvt when lhey ascertained the causo of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corsc. They were inconsoIable; both died braken-hearted.\nAubrey being put tobed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in thesc intervals be would call upon Lard Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some uriaecounlable combinatiori be seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the bcing he loved. At other times he would imprecato maledictions upon bi\u017f bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at thls tirne to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of tho state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself ln the \u017fame house, and became his constant clttendant. Whenlhe latter recoucred from his delirium, he was h0rrjfied and startlod at the sight of hjm whose image be had now combiried with that af a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, irnplying almost repentance for the faull that had caused tbeir separation, and still more bythe attentiori, clnxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him ta his presence. His lordsbip soemed quite chclnged; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalcscence began to be rapid, he agajn grcldually retlred into lhe sarne statc of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from tho former man, except that at tj mes he was surprised to meet his gclze fixed intently upon him, with a smile af malicious exultatjon playing upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smile haunted him. Duririg the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raifed by thc cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbf, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appearedto wish toavoid tbe eyes af all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastieity of spirit which had once so distinguished him riow seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silenee as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for soljtude, his mind could not find il in the neighbourhood of Athens; jf he soughl it ami dst lhe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form sto od by his side\u2014jf be sought lt in the w0ods, her light step would appoar wanderingamidst the uriderw ood, in qvest of tho modest violet; theri svddenly lurning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her palo face arid wounded throat, wjtb a meok smile upon her lips. He determjned to fly sceries, every feature of which created sucb bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom he held himself bound by tbe tender care he had taken of hjm during his illness, that they should visit those parts os Greece neilher had yet seen. They travelled in every diroclion, ond sought every spot to wbich a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seomed nol to heed what thcy gazed upon. They heard mvch of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, whieh they imaginod were anly the lnvenli0n of individuals, wbose interest it was ta excite tbe gencro\u017fity of those whom they defended from pretcnded dangers. In consequence of thus neglectirig the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they lravelIed with only a few gvards, more to serve as guides than as a defe nce. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, at the bottom of which was the hed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neigbbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the wholo of the party engclged in lhe narrow pass, when they were startled bythe whistIing of bullets close to their heads, and by the ecboed report os several guns. In an iristarit their guards had loft thcm, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had bcgvn to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitatjng lheir example, retired for a moment behind the shcItering turn of the defile: but asharned of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouls bade them advance, and being exposed to unrcsisting slaughter, if clny of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, theydetermined at onee to rush forward in search of tho onemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, whon Lord Ruthven rece ived a shot in tho shovlder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assi\u017ftanco; and, no longor heedirig the contest or hif own peril, was soon surprised by seoing the rabbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms clnd surrendered.\nBy promises of greclt reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agrced upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014thcy being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with thc promised surn, for which he hcld an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapid1y decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appeorance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had beeriof the objoct\u017f about him: hut towards the close afthe last evening, his mind b ecame apparently uneosy, and his eyc oflcn fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may sove me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not rny life, I heed the death of my existerice as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, yovr friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tel1 me how? I wouId do any thing,\" replied Aubrcy.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I oannot explain the wholo\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my bonour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shaIl not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himsels with exultant violence, \"Swear hyall your soul reveres, by allyour nature fears, swear thot, for a year and a day yov wi1l not impart your knowledge of my crimes or deatb to any living being in any way, whatcver may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting fromtheir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hif pillow, arid breathod no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; tbe many circumstances attendlng his acquaintance with thif man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from thc presentiment af something horrible awaiting him. Rifing ear1y in the morning, he was about t0 enter the houel in whichho had lefl the corpse, when a robber met him, orid informed him that it was no longer tbere, having been conveyed by himsels and eomradc\u017f, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it shovld be exposed to the first cold ray of themoon that rose after his deatb. Aubrey astoriished, and taking several of the men, deterrnined to g0 and bury it upon the spat where it lay. But, when he had mounted lo the summit he found no traco of either the corpse or the clothes, though therobbers swore they pointed out lhe identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was hewildered in conjeoturef, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sakeof the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible missortunes, and iri which clll apparently conspired to hoighton that superstitious melancholy that bad \u017feized upon his mind, he resolved to Ieave it,and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects be had with him 6e1origing lo Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons os offenoe, m0re or less adapted to en\u017fure the death of the victim. There were sever al daggersand ataghans. Whjlst turnlng them ouer, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a shealh apparently ornamented in the same style as tbe dagger discoverod in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hasteriing to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered thatit fitted, tbough pecul-\niarIy shaped, lhe sheath he held inhif hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to lhe dagger; yet still he wished to dlsbelicve; but the particular form, the same varying tjnts upon the haft and sheolh were alike in splendour on b0th, and lest no room for doubt; there were also drops of 6lood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries wero c0ncernirig the lady he had attempted to snatcb from Lord Ruthven's seductjve arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortuno ruined, and she had not heon heard of since the departure of his lordshlp. Aubrey's mind beoame almost broken under so mony repeated horrors; he was afraid that tbis lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He bocame morose and sllent; and his only occupation oonsisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as is he were going to save the life of some onehe held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafled bim to thc Englisb shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathcrs, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embrace\u017f and caresses of his sister, all memory of the paft. If she besore, by hcr irifantine caresse\u017f, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had not that winning grace whioh gains lhe gaze and applause os the drawing-room ossemblies. Thero was none of that light brilliancy which only exlsts in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was ncvor lit up by the levity of the mind heneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul consciovs of a brighter realm. Her step wos not that light fo0ting, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may altract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. Wheri alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when ber brothcr brea thod to her his affeclion, and would in her presenceforget those griefs she knew destroyed his r est, who wou1d have cxchanged hor smi1e for that of the volvptuary? It seemed as jf those eyes,\u2014tbat face were then playing in the light of their own native sphcre. She was yet only eighleen, and had not been presented ta the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed unlil her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, thereforo, resolved that the next drawing-room, which wos fast approaching, should be the cpach of her entry into the \"bvsy scene.\" Aubrey wou1d rather hove remained in the man\u017fion of his sathers, and fed upan thc melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel inlerest about the frivolities of fashionable strangerf, when hi\u017f mind had beeri so torn by the events he had witnessed; but ho determincd to saerifice his own comforl to the pr0tection of his sister. They so0n arrived in town, and prepored for tbe next day, which hcld boen announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-roorn had riot been held for a long time, arid all who were anxious to bask in lhe smile 0f royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there wllh his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all arovnd him, engaged in lhe remembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that very place\u2014be felt himself \u017fuddenly sci2ed by the arm, and a vojce he recogriized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He hcld hardly courage to turn, fe arful of seeing a spectre that wou ld blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot up0n his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs olmost refusing to bear thoir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriagc, and wcls driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, clnd fixed his hands upon his head, af if he were afraid his thoughts were hursting from his hrain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, ho could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thaught his imagination had conjured up the lmago his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determiried, therefore,to go again into sooiety; for lhough he altempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he couId not succeed in gaining informati0n. He went a few nights after wjth bis sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving hor under the protection of o matrori, ho retired into a rocess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leauing, he roused himself, and entering anolher room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forwar d, seized his sistcr's arrn, and, with hvrried step, forced her towards the strect: at the door he found himself impeded by lhe crowd of servants who wero waiting for their lords; and while he was erigaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did nol dclre to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey becaine almost djstracled. If before his mjnd had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it erigrossed, now that the certainty 0f the monster's living agoin pres\u017fed upon his thoughts. His \u017fistcr's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that sbe intreated him to explain to her what had c aused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terri-\nfied her. Tbe more he thovght,lhe more he wcls bewildered. His oath startIed him;\u2014was he then to alIowthis monstcr to roam, boaring ruin upon bis breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avertits progress? His very sister might have been touehed by him. But even if he were ta break his oath, and difc1ose his fuspicions, who would be1ieve hirn? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world srom such a wrelch; but death, he remembered, hcld beeri already mocked. For days he remainedin this state; shut up in hi\u017f room, he saw no one, and ate only wben his sister eame, who, with oyes streoming with tears, besought bim, for her sake, to support nature. Al last, no longer capable of bearing stilIness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His drefs became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to thc noon-day suri as to the midriight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first hc returnedwith the evening to tho house; hut at laft hc laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook hjm. His sister, anxious for his safety, employod peopIe lo follow bim; but they were soon dislanced by bim wbo flcd from a pvrfuer swifter thon any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whoso presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into socioty, and watch him olosely, anxious to forewarri, in \u017fpjte of his oath, a1l whom Lord Ruthven appr0ached with inli-\nmacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so ftriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him lo abstclin from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected hirn so strongly. When, h0wever, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardjans thovght proper to inlerpofe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, tbey thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDefirous of saving bim from the injuries and sufforings he had daily encounterod in his wonderlngs, and of preventirig him from expasing to tho general eye those marks of what they considcred folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appearcd to notice it, so compl etely wcls his mind absorbed by 0ne terrible subject. His incaheronce 6ecame at last so great, lhat he was confined to his chamber. There he w0uld often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He bcld become emacioted, his eyes had attained a glassy lu\u017ftre;\u2014the only sign of affection and rccollection remaining displayed itself upori the entry of his sistcr; then he would soinetimes start, and, seizing her hands, witb looks that seuerely offlicted her, hewould desire her not to touob him. \"Oh, do riot touch him\u2014if your love sor me is aught, do riot go near him!\" Wheri, however, sbe inquired to wbom he referred, his only ariswer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a slate, whence not even she c0uld roufe him. This losted many moriths: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his inind threw off cl portiori os its gloom, wbilst hi\u017f guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upori his fingerf a definile nvmber, and then smile.\nTho time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of lhe year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with bis physician vpon the melancholy circumstance os Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when hif si\u017fter was going riext day to be married. Instantly Aubrey'f attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of retvrning intcllcct, of which they feared he had been doprived, they mentioned the nome of the Earl of Mclrsden. Thinking this was o young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed ploased, and astonished them still more by his expres\u017fing his intention to be pre sent clt tho nuptials, and desiring to see his \u017fisler. They ariswered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was appclrently again capable of being affected by the influe nce of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her check, wet with tears, flowing clt the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of afsection. He began to \u017fpeak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distjnguished far rank arid euery accompllshment; wben he suddenly perccivod a locket upon her breast; opening it,what was his surprise at bebolding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He sei2ed the portrait in a paroxysm of rago, and trampled it vndcr fo0t. Upon her asking hlm why he thus destroyed theresemblance of her fvtvre husband, he looked as if he did not understarid her\u2014then seizing her horids, arid gazing ori her with a frantic expression 0f couritenan ce, he bade her swear that she wou1d never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it feemed as if that voice again bade him remember his ooth\u2014he turned suddenly rovnd, thinki ng Lord Rut hven was near him but saw no one. Iri the meantime the guardians and pbysician, who had heard lhe whole, and thought this was but cl return of his djsorder, entered, and forcing him from Mi\u017fs Aubrey, dosired hor to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be implored, he begged of lhem to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to tho insanity they imagined had taken possession of his m ind, endcavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvenhad called tbe morning aster the drawing-room, andhad bcen rcsused witb every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health,he readily understood hiinself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemcd insane, his exultation and pleasure could bardly be concealed fr0m those amongwhom be had gained thif information. He hastened to tho house of his former compclnion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affectlan for the hrother and interest in his fate, he gradually w0n the ear of Miss Au6rey. Who could resist his power? His tongue bad dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself cls of an individual having no \u017fympathy with any heing on the erowded earth, savc with her to whom he oddressed himse1f;\u2014could tell bow, since be knew her, his existence, had begun lo seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thal he mighl listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in flne, he kncw so welI how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, thal he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening thc marriage, (in \u017fpite of her brother's dcranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by thc physicion and his guardiaris, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in lhe grave, who once held her in their arm\u017f as their hope and the hope os their hovse, to delay but for a few bours that marriagc, on which he denouncedthe most hea uy curses. Tbe servclnts promised they woulddeliuer it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it belter not t0 haross any more the mind af Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, lhe ravings of a maniac. Night possed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation.Morning came, arid the sound af carriages 6roke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cur-\niosity of the servants at last ovorcamo their vigilance, lhey gradually stolo away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in o moment found himself ln the clpartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first lo perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takirig his arm by force, hvrried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the stalrcase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oa tb, and know, jf not my bride to day, your sjster is dishonoured. Women are frajl!\" So saying, ho pushed him tawards bis clttendarits, who, roused by the 0ld woman, had come in soarch of him. Aubrey could no longer support hi mself; his rage not finding ucnt, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was convcyed to bed. This was not mentioned tohis sister, who was not present when he enlered, as the physician was asraid of agitating hcr. The marriage was solomnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAubrey's weokness iricreased; lhe effusion 0f blood produced symptoms of the near approach 0f death. He desired his sister's guardjans mighl be called, and when the midnight hovr had struck, hc relatod composcdly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediateIy after.\nThe guardians hostened to prolect Miss Aubrey; but when they clrrived, il was too late. Lord Ruthveri had disappeared, and Aubroy'f sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CD NTAINING AN ACCOUNT0F LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The warld was alI before him, where to choose his p1ace of rest, and Providence his guid-\ne.\"\nIN Sai1ing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty'f vessels, in the year 1812, wo put irito the harbour of Milylene, in the jslclnd of that name. The beauty of this place, and the cortain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induee many British vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war andmerchantmen; and though it lies rother out of the track for ships bound toSmyrna, its bounties amply repay forthe deviotion of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the mcn were employed in watering, arid the purscr bargainirig for cattle with the natives, lhe clergyman and rnyfelf to0k a rainble to the cove callod Homer's Schoo1, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a srnall monticu1eso narned) we met with clnd engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our clrriual in his fclucoa. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would hove lakeri me wjth him; but I did not choase to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing lhc river, belongs to him, and he has 1eft an old man in chclrge of it: he gave Dominick, tbe wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currenc-\ny,) and ha\u017f resided there about fourteen m0nths, though not constantly; for he sails in hls fe1ucca very often to the differerit islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no timc iri hastening to the housc where our eountryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old inan, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four oparlments ori lhe grovnd-sloor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting porlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious c1oset annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stainedwallf, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fjxed in the side of o small bronze Venus iri a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa completed thefurniture. Iri the ha1I stood half a dozon English cane chairs, and an empty book-casc: there were no mirror\u017f, nor a single pajnting. The hedchamher had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, wlth lwo stuffed cotlon quiltf and a pillow\u2014the cornm0n bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-roam we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with bookf and pap ers, which were then in a large seamcln'\u017f chest in the elosel: it wos open, but we did not think o ursclves justified in examining the contents. 0n the tablet of the recesf lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, clnd Rousseau's works complete; Volricy's Rujns of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play af the Robbers; Mjlton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editian, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press ot Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English bo0k of any doscription. Most of lhese book\u017f were fillcd with marginal ri0tes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading thesc books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unti1 hi\u017f return; for he is so pclrticular, that were I to moue one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I oncc did him a fervice; and I bave the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arrnenian who refides in a small cottagc in the wood, and whom theIord brought here sr0m Adrianople; I don't know for whal reason.\"\nTbe appearance of the bouse externa1ly was pleasing. The portico in front was flfly paces long and sourteon broad, and the fluted marble pil1ars with black plinths and fret-work cornicef, (as it i\u017f now customary iri Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof.The roof, surrounded by a ljght stone balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpet, beneath ari awning os \u017ftrong coarsc linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon tbemthe Greeks pass their overiings in smoking, drinking lighl wines, such as \"lachryrna christi,\" eating fruit, arid enjoying the evenirig breeze.\nOn the left bandas we entered the house, a small streamlet glided awoy, grapes, oranges and 1imcs were clvstering togethcr on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushe\u017f, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we wcre told, the lordpassed many of bis evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writirig, and talking to himse1f. \"I suppase,\" sclid the oldman, \"praying\" far he was vcry devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sun dclys.\"\nThe view from tbis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards ledthe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees iri bloom, andon the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A sinall stroam issuing from the rulns descended iri brokon cascades, until it was lost ln tbe woods near the mourilain's baso. The sea \u017fmooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the vlew in front; and a little on the lest, through a vista of l0fty cbesnut ond palm-trees, seueral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerclld grcen. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did tbis; but aur cnquiries were fruitless as to the name of the pcrson who had resided in this romontic soljtude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Caridia. \"The Armenian,\" said our condvctor, \"could tell, but I am surc he wi1l not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town wo learnt several particulars of the isolaled lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial fcast. He gave a cow to ane man, horses to other\u017f, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weavirig these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gaue Greek Testaments to the poor children. In shorl, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benouolent character. One circumstarice we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to discl0se. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was osten seen waIking on tho sea-shore, and he had bovght her a piano-forte, and tavght her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inforination with wblch we doparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylerie; our imagjnatioris all on the rack, guesslng who this rambler in Greece could be. He hcld money it was evident: he had philanthropy of djsposition, and a1l those eccentricities whieh mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doublswere dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lrclvelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individval,\" said he, \"about whom yauare so anxjous, is Lard Byron; I met hjm in my travels on the is1and of Tenedos, and I also visited him al Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his l ordship's fame, as we had been \u017fome years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more euriovs in our researches at the cottage, hut we consoled ourselves with the idea of returnirig to Mitylone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quiteuninlerestirig, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of clri unfeeling dispositi0n, averse to associating with human nature, or contribuling in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add lo its plea\u017fures. Tbe fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from thcse little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elcgantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his hosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his aclions: and his courting the rcpose of solitude is an addilional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over who\u017fe head Benevolence bath thrown her mantle. No man can read the precedlng pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of himas a c0untryman. Wilh respect to his loves or pleclsures, I do not assume a right to give an opiniori. Reports are evor to be recoived with caution,partieularly when dlrected against man's maral integrity; and he who dares justify hiinself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alono may censuro the errorf of a fellow-morla1. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genlus. To da good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuouf he art and self-approving coriscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Pririter, Crown-court, FIeet-street.","38":"THEVAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wllliam Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which tbis tale is founded is very general in lhe East. Among the Arablans it appears to be common: it did not,however, extend itself to the Greek\u017f until after lhe establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form \u017fince the division of the Latin and Greek churehes; at whjch time, the idea becomjng prevalent, that a Latin body covld not corrupt if buried in their territory, it graducllly increased, and farmed the subject of rnany wonderful stories, still oxtarit, os lhe dead rising from their graves, and fcoding upon the blood of the yaung arid beautjful. In the West it spread, with s0me slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where tbe belief existed, that uampyres nlghtly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, wh0 became einaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died os consumptions; whilst tbese hurnan blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins hooame distended to such a stato of repletion, as to cause lhc blood lo flow from all the passag es os their bodies, and even from the very pores of thelr skin\u017f.\nIn the L0ndon Journal, of March, 1732, is a eurious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vclmpyrism, whjch is statcd to have occurred at Madreygcl, in Hungary. It oppears, that upon an examination of the commander-jn-chief and mclgistrates of the place, thoy positively and unanimously affirrned, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pau l, had heeri heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of lhe Turkish Servia, he bad been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a wcly to rid hi inself of the evil, by ealing some os the earth outos the vampyre's graue, and rubbing himself wjth his blood. This precaution, however, did nol prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days aftor his death and burial, many persons complained of having heen lormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of ljfc by his ottacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, arid found it (as is supposed to be u\u017fual in cases of vampyrism) fresb, and entireIy free from corruption, and emitting at the movth, nose, and eclrs, pure arid florid 6lood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely thraugh tho heart and body of ArnoId Paul, ot which he is reported to hclve cried out as dreadfvlly as if he had been alive. Tbi\u017f done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the clshes into his grave. The same measvres were cldopted wilh the corfes of those per\u017fons who had prcviously djed from vampyrism, lesl they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who \u017furviued them.\nThe universal belief if, that a person sucked by o varnpyre bccames a vampyre himself, and sucks iri hjs turn.\nChlef bailiff.\nThis inonstrous rodomoritade is here related, hecause it seems betteradapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instclnce which could he adduccd. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort 0f punishment after death, for some heinous crime oommjttedwhilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyriso, but compelled to corifine his infernal visitations saIely to thosc beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties 0f kindred and affection.\u2014A supposltion alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt tho native place, And suok the blo0d of all thy roce; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At rnidnjght drain tho stream of lise; Yet locltbe the banquet which perforce Muft feed thy Iivid livlng oorse, Thy victiins, cre they yet expiro, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy fl0wers are withered on the stem. But one that sor thy crime mvst fall, The youngest, besl heloved af all, Shall bless thee with a father's namo\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart ln flclme! Yet thou must end thy task arid mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Whioh freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Theri with unhallowed handshall tear The tresses af her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's foridesl pledge wcls worn\u2014 Butnow is borne away by thoe Memorial of thinc agony! Yet witb thine own be\u017ft blood shall drip; Thy gnashing t ooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sulleri grave, Go\u2014and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild bvt beautiful poem of \"ThaIaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneizcl, who is represented af having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst iri existerico. But this connot be supposed to have resulled from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed tbroughout the whaIe of the tale as a complete type of purity and jnnocence. The veracious Toumefort giues a long account in his travelf of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whjch he pretends lo have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this svbject, besides a variely of anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives illustrative of itf effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to proue it ta be a classjcal, as well a\u017f barbarjan error.\nMany cvrious and intore sting notlces ori this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though lhe prcsent may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devotcd to explancltion, and which may now be conoluded by merely remclrking, thal though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several otherssynoriymous with it, rnade use of in various ports os theworld: as Vroucalocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Br0ucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that ln the midsl of thc dissipations ottendant upon a London win-\nter, there appeared at the varlous parties of the leadors of the tori a n0bleman, more remarkablo for his singuIarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth clraund hlm, as is he c0uld not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracled his attentian, that he mighl by cl look qvell it, and throw sear into tho\u017fe breasts where thoughtlessriefs reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could riot explain whence it aroso: somc altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, sixing upon the o6ject's face, did notseem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of tho heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaderi ray that weighed upon lhe skin it could n0t pass. Hjs peculiarities covsed him to be invited to every hovsc; all wished to seo him, and those who bad beeri accustomed to violent excitcment, and now felt the weight of ennui, were ploased at having s0mething in their presence capable of engaglng lheir altention. Iri spite os the deadly hue of his face, which neuer gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the ftrong cmotion ofpassiori, though its form and outline wcre beautiful, many of the female hvnters after notoriety attempted to win his attent-\nians, and gairi, at least, same marks of what they might term asfeclion: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-r0oms since her marriage, threw her\u017felf in his way, and did clll but put on the dresf of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though jn vain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's,still it seemed as is they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence wcls baffled, arid she left the field. But though the common adultre\u017fs could not influence evon the guidance of his eyes, jt was not that the female sexwas indifferent lo him: yet such was the apparent cclution with which ho spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughler, that few knew he ever addressed himself to femalef. He had, however, the reputation of a winnirig tongue; and whether it was tbat it euen 0vercame the dread of his sjngular character, or thclt they were moved by his apparent hotred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the sametime, there came to Loridon a young geritleman ofthe name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an orily sister in the possession of great wealth, by pclrerits who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty mereIy to take care of his fortune, whiIe they relinquished the more imporlant charge of his mind lo the care os mercenary subaltcrns, he cullivated more his imagination lhari hi\u017f judgment. He had, hence, that high romclntic foeljng of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprenlices. Hc believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice mereIy for the picturesque effect of the scene,as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely eonsisted in the vesting of clothef, which were as warm, butwhlch were better adapted to the painter'seyo by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, thclt the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, arid rich: sar these reaso-\nns, upon his entering inlo the gay circles, many mothers surrourided him, striuing which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at tbe some time, by thejr brightening countenances when he approached, and by thoir sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon Ied him into faIse notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romonce of his s0litclry hourf, he was startled at finding, that, except in the lallow and wax candles that fllckered, not from the presence of a ghost, bvt srom want of snuffing, th ere was no foundatlon in reallife for any of that congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumcs, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some componsation in his gratified vanity, be was aboul to re1inquish his dreams, when the oxtrclordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched bim; and tho very impossibility of forming an idea of the charactcr of a man enlirely abforbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observalion of extemal objects, than the tcleit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of lbeir contact: allowirig his imagination to picture evcry thing that flattered jts propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed thjs objcct into the hcro os a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of hi\u017f fclncy, rather than the pcrson before him. Hebecame acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advariced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognjsed. Hc gradually learnt that Lord Rutbven's osfairs were embarrossed, and soori found, from tho notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, tbat he was ahout to trovel. Desirous of gajning some information respecting thjs singular character, who, till now, had only whettcd his curiosity, he hinted to his guardian\u017f, that it was time for him ta perform the tour, whlch sor many generatlons has been thought necessary to enclble the young to take some ropid steps in the career of vjce towards putting tbemselve\u017f upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to oppear as lf fallon from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of ploasantry ar of praise, according to the degree of skilI shewnjn corrying them ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive srom him a proposal to join him. Flatteredby such a mark of estoem from him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly aecepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto,Aubrey had bad rio opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvcn's character, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to hif conduct. His companion was profusc in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagaband, and the beggar, received from his hand more than oriough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuovs, reduced to indigencc by the misfortunos attendant even upon virtue, that he 6estowcd his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wa1low in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This waf, however, attributed by him to the greater irnportunity of the viciouf, which generaIly preval1s 0ver the retirjng bashfulness of the virtvous indigenl. There was one circum\u017ftarice about the eharity of hls Lordship, which was still more impressod upon his mind: all those upon whom it was hestowed, inevitably found lhat there was a curse upon il, for they were aIl either led to lhc scaffold, 0r sunk to the lowest and the most abjecl misery. At Brussels and other towns throvgh which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at tho apparent eagerness with which his compariion sought for the centres of all sashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and thon he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, withwhich hc generaIly watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encounterod the rash youthfu1 novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed f0rtune's law\u2014this apparenl abstractedness of mjnd was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more firethari thclt of the cat whilst dallying wlth the half-dead mouse. In every town, helefl the formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this flend; whilst many a father fat frantic, amidst tbe speaking 1ooks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing af his late imrnenso wealth, whorewith to buy oven susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yethe took no moriey from the gam6ling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had ju\u017ft snatched from the convulsive grasp os the innocen t: this might but be the resu1t of a certain deg ree of knowledge, which was not, however,capable of c0mbating the cunning of the more expericnced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign thatcharity and pleasvre which proved the ruin of cll1, ond did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he dclayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him sorne opportunity of speaking srankly and openly to him; bowever, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his cclrriage, and clmidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; ond th0ugh Avbrey was nearthe objeet of his curiosity, he obtained no groater grotification fr0m it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing lo break thal mystery, whjch to his exalted imagination begari ta assume the appearance of somelhjng supernaturaI.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upan the morning cjrclc of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorlals of another alinost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letlers arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the firsl was from his sister, 6reathing nothing bul affeotion; the others were from hif guardians, the latter astoriished him; if it had before entered into his imagination thot there wa\u017f an evil power resident jn his companion, these \u017feemed to give him sufficierit reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his sriend, and vrged, that his c haracter was dreadfully vicious, for thal the possession of irresistibIe powers of seductian, rendcred his liccntious habits more dangerous to fociety. It had been discover ed, that bis eontempt for the adultress had not orlgiriated in hatred of her character; but lhal he had required, to enhance his gratisication, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle ofunsulIied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatiori: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposo thc whole desormity of their vices ta the public gaze.\nAubrey deterinined upon lea-\nving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on whjch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abaridoning him oltogelher, purposing, in the mean whi le, lo watch him inore cIosely, and to let no sligbt circum\u017ftances pass by unnoticed. Ho entered irito the sclme circ1e, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work vpon the inoxperience of tbe daughler of the lady whose houso he chiefly frequented. In Italy, jt if seldom that on unmarried female is met with ln s0ciety; ho was therofore obliged lo carry on his planf in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered thal an assignati0n had been oppointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of on inn0cent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked bim his intentions with respect ta the lady, informing him at tbe same time that he was aware of hif being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answerod, that his interitions were such os he supposed all would have upon fuch an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decljne acoompanying his Lordship in the remalnder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servclnt to soek other apartmerits, and calling upon tbe mother 0f thc lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughler, but also cancerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation wcls preverited. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; bul did not hirit any \u017fuspiclon of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHav ing left Rome, Aubrey directod his ste ps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula,soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the bouse ofa Greek; and soon occvpied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon inonumerits that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deed\u017f of freemen only bofore slaves, had hidden themselves bencath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under thc same roof as himself, oxistcd a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a palnter wjshi ng to pourtray on canvass tbo promised hope os the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could helong to those who had no souls. As she danced vpon the plain, or tripped along the inountain's side, one would have thought tbe gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who wouId have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated naturc, for that slecpy Iuxurious look of the animal suited but to tho taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompclnied Avbrey in hif search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of o Ka shmero butterf1y, show tbe whole beauty of her form, floclting as it were upon the wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almofl effaced labIet, ln the contemplation of her sylph-like figurc. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such dolicately bril1iant and swistly fading bues, it might we1l excvse the forgetfvlness of the anllquary, who let escape from his mind the very object hc had before thought of vilal importanee to the proper interpretation of o passage in Pausanias.But wby attempt to dcscribe chorms whlch oll fcel, but none can appreoiate?\u2014It was innocence, yovth, and beauty, unaffectod by crowded drawing-rooms arid stif1ing ballf. Whilst he drew those rcmains of which he wished to pre\u017ferue a memorial far his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of hi\u017f pencil, in tracing tbe scenes of her notive place; she would then describe to him the cjrcIing dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing col0urs of youlhful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing inher infancy; and then, tvrning to su6jects that had euidently made a greater jmpression upon ber mind, wovld tell him alI the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earneslncss and appclrent belief of what she nclrrated, excited the interest even of Avbrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wbo had passed years amidst his frlends, arid dearest ties,forced evcry year, by feeding upon the lise of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, hjs 6lood would run cold, whilst hc attempted to laugh her out of such idIe and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several os their near relatiues and children bad been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found bim so incredulaus, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarkcd, that those who bad dared to quostion lheir existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, witb grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descripti0n of Lord Ruthven; he, however, stjll persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truthin her fears, lhough al lhe same tjme he wondered at the manycoincidencef which had all tended to excite a be1ief in the svpernatural power of Lord Rulhven.\nAubrey began to attach hjm\u017fe1f more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted wjth all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision af romance, w0n his heart; and whilo be ridiculed the idea of a young man of English babils, marrying an unedvcated Greek girl, still he found bimself more and more attached to the almost fairy form6efore him. He would tear himfelf at times from her, arid, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclroh, he would depart, determjned not to return untjl bis object was attained; buthe aIways found it impossible to fix his attentjon upori the rvjns arovnd him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone lhe rightful possessor os his thoughls. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, arid was ever the same frank lnfantile being he had first known. She always seemed to partfram him with reluctanco; but it was bccausc she had no longer any one with whom she could vislt her fclvourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering somc fragment whicb had yet escaped the deslructive hond of time. She had appealed to her porents on the subject of Vampyres, and they hoth, with soveral present, afflrmed their cxistence, pale with horrar at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determjned to proceed upon one of hi\u017f excursions, whieh was to detain him for a few hovrs; wben they heard the name of the place, lhey all at once begged of him not to return at riight, os he must necessarily pafs througb a wood,where no Greek would evor remain, afterthe day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of tbe vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, arid denovnced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, clnd tried lo laugb them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus ta mock a superi0r, inferrial power, the very name os which appclrently made their 6lood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey sel 0ff upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncholy sace os his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible flends, had inspired tbem with svch terror. When hewas abovt to depart, Ianthe cclme to the side of hi\u017f horse, and earne\u017ftly beggod of him to return, ere night all0wed lhe power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he djd not perceive thclt day-lighl would soon end, ond that in the hori2on there was one af those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendouf mass, and pour all their rage upori the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horsc, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it wclf too late. Twilight, in these southern climatos, ls almost unknown; immediotely the sun sets, night bcgins: and ere he had advanced far, the pow cr af the storm was above\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014itf thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at bis very feel. Suddenly his horso took fright, and he was carried with dreadfu1 rapidity thraugh the entangled forest. The clnimaI at last, through fatjgue, stopped, arid he found, by the glare os lightning, lhat he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted jtself up from the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood which furroundod it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him ta thc t0wn, or at l east trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of tbe storm. As he approached,the thunders, for a momenl sjlent, allowed him to hear the dreadful fhrieks of a w0incln mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery af a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: bvt, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, farced openthe do0r of the hvt. He found himself in utter darkness: the soun d, however, gvided him. He was apparently unperceived; sor, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found him\u017felf in contact with some one, wh0m he immediately seized; when a voice eried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt hiinself grappled by one whose strength secmed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife af dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his seet and hurled with enormous foroe against the grovnd:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his lhroat\u2014when the glare of many torchos penetrating thraugh the hole that gave llghl in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instaritly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl moment the crashjng of the branches, as he broke through the woad, was no langer heard. The storm was riow still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded ori every individual straw with heavy f1akes of soot. At the desire af Aubrey they searcbed sor her who had attracted him by her cries; hc was again Ieft in darkncss; but what waf his horror, wben the light of the torches onee more bursl upon him, to perceive the airy form 0f his fair conductress brought in a lifeles\u017f corse. He shut his cyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed iinagination; but he again sow the same form, when be unc1osed them, stretehed by his slde. There was rio colour upon her cheek, not even vpon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed a1most as attachirig os the life that once dwelt tbere:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her lhroat were the marks of teeth having opened the veln:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously slruck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laidby the side os her who bad lately becn to bim the object of \u017fo many bright and fairy vision\u017f, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun refloction, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciovsly jn his hand o naked dagger of a particular construction, which had heen found in the hut. They were soon met by differontparties who had been engoged in the seareh of her whom a m0ther had missed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached the city, forewamed the parents of fome dreadful catastrophe.\u2014To descrlbe their griof would be impossible; but when they ascertained lhc cause of their child's death, they lookod at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolab1e; both died brokcn-hearted.\nAubrey 6eing pvt to bed was seizcd with a mosl violent fever, and was often de1irious; in those intervals he would call vpon Lord Ruthven and upon Iantbe\u20146y some una ccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecote moledictlons upon his bead, clnd curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, chanced at tbis time to orrive at Athens, and, from whate ver molive, upori hearing of the state of Aubrey, immedjately placed himself in the same house, clnd became his constarit attendant. When the lattcr recovered from his deliriurn, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he hcld now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separcltion, and stil1 more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, so0n reconciled him t0 his presence. His lordship seemed qujte changed; he no loriger appeared that apathelio being wbo had so astonisbed Aubrey; bul af soan a\u017f bis convalescence began to 6e rapid, be again gradvally retjred into the same state os mirid, and Aubrey perceived no difserence from the former mon, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a srnile of malicious exultation playing vpon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During lhe la\u017ft stageof the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged ln watching the tideloss wave\u017f raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbf, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyesof all.\nAu6rey's mind, by this shock, was mucb weakened, and that elasticity of spiril which had once so dislinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover af solitude and sile nce as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins bo had sormerly frequerited, Ianthe's form stood by hjs side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her lightslep would appcar wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then svddenly turning rovnd, would show, to hjs wild imagination, her pale sace and wounded throat, witb a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter osfociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he held himself bound by lhe tender care he had taken of hlm during his illness, thot they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in evory direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but thoughthey thus hasteriod from place to p1ace,yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mucb of robbers, but they gradually began to slight theso reports, whicb they imagined were on1y the invention of indiuidua1s, whose iriterest it was to excile the generosity of those whom thcy defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of tbus neglecting thc advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more lo serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, h0wever, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in tbe narrow pclss, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by lhe ecboed report of several guns. In an inslant their guards had left them, ond, placing thernselves behind rocks, had begun to firc ln the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the she-\nltering turn of tbe dofile: but ashamed of being tbus detained by a foe, who with insulting shout\u017f bade them advance, and being exposod to unresisting slaughter, is ony of the robbers should cl imb above and take them in the rear, they determjned at ance to ru\u017fh forwclrd in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost tho shelter of the rock, wheri Lord Ruthven rcceived a shot iri the shoulder, which brought him to lhe ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistarice; and, no longer heeding the canlest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' facef around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Rutbven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promisos of groat reward, Aubrey soon lnduced thcm to convey hjs wounded frierid to a neighbouring eabin; and having agreed up0n a ransom, he was no more disturbed 6y their presence\u2014they boing conterit merely to guard the eritronce tll1 their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order.Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortlfication ensued, and death seemed advancing wlth hasly steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain os he had been of theobjects about him: but towards the clo\u017fe of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer hi\u017f afsistance wlth more thon usual earnestness\u2014\"Afsift me! you moy save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mecln not my life, I heed the deatb os my cxistence a\u017f little as that of the passing day; but you may save my hon0ur, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my lise ebbs apace\u2014I cannot exploin tbe whole\u20146vt if you would conceal all you kriow ofmc, my honour were frec from \u017ftain in the world's mouth\u2014arid if my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be knowri.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wilh exultarit violence, \"Swo ar by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, fwear that, for a year and a day you will notimpart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being iri ony way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from thoir sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing vpon bis pillow, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many cjrcumstances altending his acquaintance with this man r0se upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remoinbered hjs oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awcliting him. Rising early in the mornirig,he wa\u017f about to enler the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and inforined him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himsolf andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighhouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold rayof the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking sevorcll of the men, determined to go and bury jt upon the spot where it lay. Bvt, when he had mounted to the summit hc found no trace of eithcr the corpse or lhe clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which tbey had laid the body. Far a lime his mindwas bcwildered in conjectures, but he at lclst returned, convinced thclt they had buried the corpse for the sake 0f lhe clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had metwith such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancboly thclt had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waitirig for a uessel to convey him to Otranto, or lo Naplcs, he occupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with hlm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst otber things there was cl casc containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. Thcre were feveral daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning lhem ouer, and examining their curious forms, whclt was his surprise at findirig a sheath apparenlly ornamonted in the same style as the dagger discovered in lhe fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastenlng to gain further proof, he found the woapon, and his horror may be imagined when be discovered lhat it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his h and. His eyes soemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelievo; but the porticu1ar farm, tbe same varyjng tints upon the haft and shcath were aIike in splendour on both, and left rio room for doubt; thero were also draps of hlood on eaeh.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way homo, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatoh from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their f ortune ruined, and she had not been beard of since the doparture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almosl broken under so many repcated horrors; he was clfraid that this lady had fal1en a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became rnorose and silent; and his only occupation oonsisted in urging the speed of the postilions,as if he were going to saue the life of some orie ho bold dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hlm to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lase, in the embraces and coresses of his sister,alI memory of the past. If shebefore, by her infantine caresses, hod gaincd bis clffection, riow that the womari began to appeor, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thot winning graoe which gains the gaze and applause of tbe drclwing-room assemblies. Tbere was riarie of that light brilliancy wbich only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartrnent. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mjnd benealh. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeljng witbin, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter roalm. Hor step was not tbat lightfooting, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pen\u017five. When alone, hor face was never brightenod by tbe srnile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his asfection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed bis rest, who would have excharigod her smile for thot of the v0luptuary? It seem ed a\u017f if those eyes,\u2014-\nthat face were thon playing in the light of their own native sphere. She wos yet only eightcen, and had not becn presented to the world, il having bcen thoughl by her guardions more fit that her presentation sh0uld be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It waf now, therefore, resolved that the nexl drawing-room, which wos fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the marisiori of his sathors, and fed upon lhe melancho1y whioh overpowered him. He could not feel inlerest about the frivolities of fashionablo strangers, when his mirid had been so torn by the events he had witnossed; bvt he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his \u017fister. They \u017foon arrived in town,and prepared for the next day, which hcld boen announeed as a drawing-room.\nThe cro wd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long lime, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastencd thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a comer by himself, hcedless of all around hiin, engaged in the remembrance thal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himfelf suddenly seized by the arm, ond a voice he recognized too wel1, sounded in hls car\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He bad hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre tbot would blaslhim, whcn he perceived,at a little distanee, the same figure which had attracled his notice on this spot upan his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusjng to bear lheir wejght, he was o6liged t0 take the arm of a sriend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw hlinself into his cclrriago, and was drlven home. He paced the ro0m with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were 6urfting from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He rovsed bimself, be could n0t believe it possjble\u2014tbe dead rife again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the imago his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it couId be real\u2014he determlned, therefore, to go again into soeiety; for though he attempted t0 afk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon hi\u017f lips, and he could not succeed in gaining informotion. He went a few nightf after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leoving her under the prolection of a matron, he rctired into a recess, and there gove himself up to his own devourjng thoughts. Percelving, ot last, that many were leaving, he roused bimself, andentering another room, found his sislersvrrounded by several, apparentIy in earnest conuersation; he cltternpted t0 pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those featuref he most abhorred. He sprang forward, \u017feized his sisler's arm, clnd, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at lhe door he f0und himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Rernember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn,but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracled. If before his mind had been absorbed by onc subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certaintyof the morister's ljving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions werc now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conducl. He only uttered a few words, arid those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slartled him;\u2014wcls he then lo allow this rnonster to roam, bearirig ruiri vp0n his breath, amldstaIl he held deor, and not avert its progress? Hisvery sister might have been touchedby him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his sufpicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but deatb, he remembered, had been alrea dy mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister cclme, who, with eyes streaming witb tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he lest bis housc, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted bim. His dress became neglecled, and he wandered, as often expafed to the noon- day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He wasno Ionger to be recognized; at first he returned with the everiing to the houso; but at last he laid bim down to rcsl wherever fatigue overlook him. His sister, anxious for hissafely, employed people to follow bjm; but they were soon distariced by him who fled fram a pvrsuer swifter than any\u2014from tbought. His conduct, h0wever, sudderily changed. Struck wlth the idea that he left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend omongst them, of whose presence they wore unconscious, he determlncd to enter again into society, and watch him closeIy, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hif oath, all whom Lord Rvthven approached with intimaey. But when he entered into a roam, his haggard and suspicious lo0ks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his fister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, rem0nstronoe proved unauaiIjng, the guordians thought proper to intorpose, and, fearing that his mindwas becoming a1jenated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which hod been before imposedupon thcm by Aubrey's porents.\nDesirous of sauing him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of prcvenling him from exposing to tho general eye those marks of what thcy consldcred folly, they engoged a physician to reside in the house, and tclke constant eare of him. He hardly appeared to notice il, so campletely was his mind absorbed by one torrible subjecl. His incoheronce became at lclst so great, that he was consined to his cham6er. There he would often lie for days, incapable of boing roused. He had become emaoiated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only signof affection arid recollection remairiing displayed it self upon the en try of his si\u017fter; then be would sometimes start, arid, seizing her hands, wilh looks that severely afflicted hcr, he would desire her not to tauch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your loue for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reforred, his only answer was, \"True! truo!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not cven she cou1d rouse bim. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was possing, his incoherences hecame less frequent, and his mind threw off a portian of its gloom, whilst his guardlan\u017f observod, that \u017feveral ljmes in the day he would count upon hjsfingers a definite nuinber, and lhen smile.\nThc time had nearly elapsed, when, upori the last day 0f the yeor, one os his guardians entering his room, began to converse withhis physlcian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey'f being in so awful a fituati0n, when his sister was going next day to be rnarried. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he afked anxiously to whom. GIad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch they feared he had been deprlved, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thiriking this was a young Earl whom he had mel witb in s0ciely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by bis exprefsing hls jntenlion to be present at the nuptia1s, and desirlng to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the iriflvence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, clnd kissed her cheek, wet wilh tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once rnore alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all hls wonted warmth, and ta congratulate her up0n her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplisbrnent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; opening it, what was his surprise at behoIding the fcatures of the monster wh0 had so long infIuenced his life. He seized the porlrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under fool. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemb1ance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then soizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression af countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morisler, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if thal uolce again bade him reinember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinkjngLord Ruthvon was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, wh0 had beard the whole, arid thought this wcls bul o return of his disorder, cntered, and sorcing him from Miss Avbrey, desired her to leavo him. He fell upon bls knees tothem, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this tothe infanity they imagined hcld taken possession os hjs mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning aftor the drawing-room, and had beon refused with every one else. Wben he heard of Aubrey's ill heallh, he readlly understood him\u017felf to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation arid pleasure could hardly be concealed from those am0ng whom he had gained this information. He hastcned to the house of his former companiori, arid, by constant altendance, and thc pretence of great affection for the brother and intcrest in his fate, he gradually won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who c0uld resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on lhe crowded carth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could lell how, sjnce he knew her, his exislence, had 6eguri la seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her \u017foothjng accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the wlll of fate, that he gained her affecti0ns. Thc title of the elder brclrich fallirig at length to him, he ohtained an important embassy, which served as an excu\u017fe for hastenirig the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day bcfore his deporture for the oontinent.\nAubrey, wheri he was left by the physician and his guardian\u017f, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given bim; he wrote a lelter lo his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honourof those now in the grave, who once hcld her in their arms cls their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they wavld deliver it; but giving it to lhe physician, he thought it better riot to harass any more the inind of MissAubrey by, what he considered, the rovings of a moniao. Nigbt passed on without rest to the busy ininates of the house; ond Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concoived than described, the noles of bvsy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity af the servants at last ovcrcame their vigilance,they gradually stole away, leaving him in the oustody of an helpless old woman. He \u017felzed the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assernbled. L0rd Ruthven was the fir\u017ft to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him fr0m the room, speechless with rage. Wheri on the staircose, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sisler js dishonoured. Women are frail!\" S0 saying, he pushed him towards his attendarits, who, roused by the old waman, had come in search of him. Avbrey could no longer support himse1s;his rage not finding vent, had broken a blo0d-vesfel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioried t0 bis si\u017fter, who wa\u017f not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The morriage was solemnizcd, and the bride and bridegroom 1eft London.\nAubrey's weakness iricreased; the effusion ofblood pr0duced symptoms of the near approach of deoth. Hc desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had strvck, he related composedly what the roader has perused\u2014he died immediately afler.\nThe guardiaris hastened to protecl Miss Aubrey; but when lhey arrived, it was too late. Lard Rvlhven haddi\u017fappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT 0F A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose bis place of reft, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sa iling through the Grecjan Arohlpelago, on board one of his Majesty's ves\u017fels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and lhe certain supply of cattle and vegetables alwoys to be had there, induce many British ve\u017fsels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out os the track for ships bound to Smyrria, its bountjes arnply repay for lhe deuialion of a voyage. We landed; as usval, at the bottom of the hay, and whilst the rnen were employed in watcring, and the purser bargcl-\nining for cattle with the riatives, the clergymari and myse1f took a ramble to the cave ealled Homer's School, arid other places, whoro we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a smclll monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come fromScio with an English lord, who left the ifland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did nol choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but o very good man. The cottage ovcr the hill, facing thc river, bolongs to hlm, arid he ho\u017f left an old man in charge 0f it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided tbere about fourteeri months, tb0ugh not constantIy; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThjf account excited our curioslty very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had residod. We were kindly receivedby an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apclrtmenls on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitling parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet onnexed. They wcrc all simply docorated: plain green-staincd walls, marble tohIe\u017f 0n either side, a large myrtle in the centro, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made ta play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bron ze Venus in a leaning poslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In tbe hall stood half a dozon En glish cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a singlc painting. The bedchamber had merely a Iarge mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the cornmon bed throughoul Greeee. In the sitting-r0om we obserued a marble reccss, formerly, the old mari told us, filled with books and papers, wbich were then in a l arge seaman'\u017f chest in the cl0set: il was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examinlng the contcnts. On the tab let of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bolleau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Rulns os Empires; Zimmcrman, in thc Germari language; Klap\u017ftock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play os the Robbers; Milton's Parodise Lost, an Italiari editjon, prlnted at Parma in 18I0; several small pamphlet\u017f from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah wos literally scribbled all over, and marked witb slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had 6een reading these 6ooks the evenlng before he sajled, and forgot to p lace them with the 0thers; but,\" said he, \"there they must Iie until his returri; for he is so partiovlar, that were I lo move one thing without ordcrs, he would frown upon me for a week together; he js otberways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm sor the lroublo of taking care os it, except twerity zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in o fmall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reasori.\"\nThe appearance of the hou\u017fe externa1ly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long ond fourteen broad, and the flvted marb1e pilIars with black plinths and frel-work cornicef, (as it is now cuftomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was cavered by a firie Turkey carpet, beneath an awning af strong caarse linen. Mo\u017ft of the hovse-tops are tbus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass thoir ovcnings in smoking, drinking light wines, \u017fuch as \"lachryma christi,\" eatirig fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we eritcred the housc, a smal1 streamlet glided away, grape\u017f, orangos and limes were clustering together on it\u017f borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamonlal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and riights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and aIways attended our church twice a week, besldes Sundays.\"\nThe view from this soat was what may be terrned \"o bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vlneyards led lhe eyc to Mount Calcla, covered with a1ive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit os which an ancierit Greek temple clppeared iri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken eascades, until it waf lost in the woods near tbe mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unfhadowed by o single cloud, terminatos the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, severol smalI islands were distinctly observed, studding tbe light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view rnore than I did lhis; bul our enquirles were fruitless as to the name of the person who had refided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tcll, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannat you lell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I con,\" faid he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time lo visit the Armeriian, but on our roturn to the townwc learnt sevcral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight younggirls when he was last upon the island, and even danced witb them at the nuptial feast. He gave acow to one man, horses to othors, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weauing these articles. He also bought a new boot for a fisbermari wha had lost his own in a gale, and he oftcn gave Greek Teftaments lo the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from a1l we co1lected, to havc been a very eccentric and be nevolent ohoracter. One circumstance we learnt, wbich our old sriend at the cottage th0ught proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen wa1king on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use os it.\nSuch was the information with which we deparled from the peaceful isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing wbo this ramblor in Greececovld be. He had money it was evident: he had pbilanthropy of disposition, and oll those eccentricities which inark peculjar geriius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubt\u017f were dispelled. Fal1ing in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sajd he, \"aboutwhom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the isIarid of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mjtylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calclo in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been mare curious in our researchcs at the cottage, hut we consoled ourselvef with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that dcly will never return. I make this stalement, beIieving it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grosfly slandered. He has been described as of an unfoeling dlsposition, averfe to associating with human nature, or contributing jn any way to so0th ils sorraws, or add to its plea\u017fures. The fclct is directly the revorse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feellrigs of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordshjp's poems, soem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actlons: and his courting the repose of solitude ls an additional reason far mclrking him os a beirig on whose beart Religlon hath set her seal, and ovcr whose head Benevolerice hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thc preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling praud of him as o countryman. With respect lo his loves or plea\u017fures,I do not assumc a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to bc received wjtb cauti0n, particularly when direcled agairist man's moral integrity; and he who dores justify himself before that awful tribunal where all mvst appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, i\u017f the surest lestimony of a vjrtuous heart and seIf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-courl, Fleet-street.","39":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy Jobn Wi1liam Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which lhis tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabiaris it appears to be common: it djd not, however, extcnd jtseIf to the Greeks untiI after the establishmerit of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the dlvjsion of the Lcltin and Greek cburches; at whicb time, the idea bec0ming prevalent, tbat a Lalin body could not corrupl if buried in their territory, it gradually jnereased, and formed the subject of many wonderfuI stor-\nies, fljll extant, af thc dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the b1ood of the young and beautiful. Iri tho West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hvngary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of lhe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strengtb, and fpeedily dled os con-\nsumptions; whilst theso human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and thejr voins became distended to such a state 0s repletion, as to couse the 6Iood to flow from all tbe passages of their bodies, and evon from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, if a curjous, and, of course, credible account of a particular case 0f vampyrism, which is statcdto have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears,that upori an examination of lhe commander-in-chief and magislrcltes of the plaee, they positively and unanimously affirmed, thot, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cclssovia, on the frontiers of tho Turkish Servia, he had been tormerited by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himse1f of lhe evil, by eating some of the earth out of the uampyre's grave, and rubbing hiinselfwith his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becomlng a vampyre hiinself; for, about twenty or lhirty days ofter bis death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by bim,and a deposition waf made, thatfaur persons had been deprived os life by hif attacks. To prevent further mlschief, the inbabitants having consulted their Hadogni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisin) fresh, and enlirely free from corruption, and emittirig at tbe mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid blo0d. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomod remedy. A stake wa\u017f driven entirely tbrough the heart and body of Arnold Paul, ot which he is reported to have cried out cls dreadsully as if he had becn alive. This done, they cut off bis head, burned his body, and threw the ashcs into his grave. The \u017fame meosvros wero adopted with the corses of thase persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they shovld, in thcir turn, become agents upon othors who survivcd them.\nThc universal belief is,that a perfon sueked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himsclf, and sucks in his lurn.\nChief bailisf.\nThis monstrous rodomonta de is here related, because it seeins better adapted to illustrclte the subject of the prescnt observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In mariy parts of Greece il is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous erime committed whilfl in existence, that the deccafed is nat only doomed to vampyrise, but cornpelled to conflne his infernal uisitations solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth\u2014thoseto whom he wof bou nd by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alludedto in lhe \"Gjaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serit, Thy corse shall fr0m its tomb 6e rent; Then ghaft1y haunt the native place, And svck the blood of all thy race; Tbero from thy daughter, slster, wifo, At midnighl drain the stream of ljfe; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall knowthe demon for their sire; As cursing thee,thou cursing tbem, Tby flowers orc withered on the stem. But one that for lhy crime must fall, The yovngest, 6est beloved 0f all, Shall bless thee with a father's nome\u2014 That word shall wrap lhy beort in flamo! Yet thou must ond thy task and mark Her cheek'f last tinge\u2014her eyc's last spark, And lhe last glassy glance must view Which freezes 0'er its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hclnd shall tear The tresses of her yelIow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borneaway by thee Memorial of thirie agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashirig looth, and haggard lip; Thon \u017ftalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014ond with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed thcln they.\nMr. Southey has also jntrodvced in his wild but beautlful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of lhe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is reprcsented as having returried from the grave for tho purposc of tormenting him she bestloved whilst in existence. But thi\u017f canriot be supposed lo have resultod srom the sinfulness of ber life, fhe being pourtrayed lhroughout the whole of the tale af a camplete type of purity and innocence. The veraci0us Tournefort gives a long account in bis trclvels of sevcral astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calinet, in hif great work upon this subject, besides o variety of clnecdotos, and tradilionary narratives illustralive of its cffects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbariari error.\nMany curious and interesting nolicef on this singularly horrible superstitian mlght be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, neoessarily devoted to explanation, and wbich may now be concluded by merely remarking, that thougb tbe term Vclmpyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts af the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulacba,Goul, BroucoIokcl, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst af the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at thc various parties 0ftbe leaders of the ton a nobleinan, more remarkable for his sirigularities, than his ronk. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not participate thereln. Apparently, the light laughter of tbe fair only clttracted his attenti0n, that he might by a la0k quell it, and thraw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness rcigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence il arose: some attri6uted it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did nat seem to perietrate, clnd at one glanee to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden roy that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caufed him to be invited to overy bouse; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the wejgbt 0f ennui, were pleased ot having something in their presence capable of engaging tbeir attentio n. In spite of tbe deadly hue of his face, whicb never gained o warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong e m0tiori of passion, thovgh ils form and outlino were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to wjn his attentions, arid gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who hod been lbe mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since hcr marriage, threw hersolf in his way, and did all but put on the drcss of a mountcbank, to attract his riotice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when \u017fhe stood bofore him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were vnperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But thougb the common adultress could nol influence evon lhe guidance of his eyes, it was riot lhat tho female sex was indisferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he sp0ke to the virtuous wife and inriocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to seinales. He had, however, the reputation of a winriing t0ngue; and whethor it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred af vice, he was as oftcn among those femoles who forrn tho boast of tbeir sex from their domestic virtves, as ainong th0se who su1ly it 6y thcir vices.\nA6out the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the nome of Aubrey: he was ari arphan left with an orily sister in the po\u017fsession of great wealth, by parents who died while bo was yot in cbildhood. Left also to himself by guclrdians, who thought it their duty merely to take care os his fortune, while they relinquished the more imporlant charge of his mind to the care of mereenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imaginatiori than his jvdgment. He hod, hence, that high romantic fee1ing of honour and candour, whioh daily ruins so many milliners' apprenllces. He believed all tosympathise with virt-\nue, and thought that vice was lhrown in by Providence merely for the picturesqve efsect of lhe scene, aswo see inromances: he thought thclt the misery of a cottage merely consisled in the vefting of clothes, which were as warm, but whjch were better adapted to the painte-\nr's eye by lheir irregulclr folds and variouscoloured patches. Hc thought, in fine, thot the dreams os p0ets were the realities of life. He wos h andsome, frank, and rich: for these reosons, upon his entering into thc gay circIes, many mothers surrounded him, striving which\u017fhould descrlbe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the doughters at the sarne time, by their brlghtening countenances wben he approoched, and by their spark1ing eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of bif talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romclnce of his solitary hours, he was startled al finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from wantof snuffing, there was no soundatlon ln real life for ony of that congeries of pleasing pjctures and description\u017f contclined iri those volumes, from whicb he had formed bis sludy. Findlng, however, \u017fome compensation in his gralified vanity, he wa\u017f about to relinquish hif dreams, wheri the extraordinary being we have ahove descrlbed, crofsed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hjmself, who gave few other figns of his observation of exlernal objects, thcln the tacjt assent to their exislence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propcnsjty toextravagant ideas, he soon formed this objeet into the hcro of a romance, and determined to observc lhe osfspring of his fancy, rather thantho person besore him. He 6ecame acquainted witb bim, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upan his notioe, tbat his presence was always recognised. He gradually Ioarnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were ombarrassed, and soon found, froin tho notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some iriformation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only wbetted his curiosity, hehinted to his guardians, that it wos lime for him to pcrform the tour, which for many generations has been thought neeessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if follen from tbe skios, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to tbe degrec of skill shewn in corrying lhem on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal la join him. Flattered by such a inark os cftecm from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly acccpled it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, though many more of hls actians wcre oxposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions fr0m the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was prosuse in his liberality;\u2014the id le, the vagabond, and the beggar, roceived from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wantf. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reducod to indigencc by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the d0or with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wclnts, bvt to allow hiin to wallow in his lust, or to sirik him still deeper in hjs iniquity, he wos sent away with rich charity. Tbis was, however, attributed by him t0 the greater imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevail\u017f over the retiring bashfulness of the vjrtuous iridigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was sliIl more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whoin it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a cvrfe upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most ahject misery. At Brussels andother towns lhrough which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at thc apparerit eagerness with whicb hi\u017f companion sought for the centres of all fashionablc vice; there he cntered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with fuccess, except where the known shclrper was hjs antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gainod; but it was always wilh the same unchanging faoe, wilh which he generally watchcd the society clround: il was nol, however, so wben ho encounterod the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish feemed fartune's law\u2014this apparenl abstractedness of mirid was 1aid aside, and hjs eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cal whllst dallying wilh the half-dead mouse. In euery towri, he left the formerly aff1uent youth, torn from the oircle hc adorned, cursing, in tho soIitvde of a dungcon, the fate tbat bad drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whiIst many a father sat frantic, amidfl thc speaking looks os mute hungry children, with0ut a \u017fingle sarthing of his 1ate immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving.Yet he took n0 money from the gombling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, tbe lclst gilder he had just \u017fnatched from lhe conuulsive grasp of the innocent: lhis might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich was not, however, eapabIe 0s comboting the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrcy often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and did not tend to his owri profit;\u2014hut be delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some apportunity of speaking frankly and openly to hjm; bowever, this riever occurred. Lard Ruthveri in his carriage, and amidst tbe vari0us wi1d and rieh scenes af nature, was olways tho same: hiseye spokeless than his lip; arid thovgh Aubrey wos near the objoct of his curiosjty, heo6tained no groater gr atificatlon from it than the canstant excitement of vainly wishing to break that inystery, which to his exa lted lmagination began to assume the appearance of something fupernotural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time losl sightof his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon lbe morning circlc of an Ita1ian countess, whilst he went in seorch of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thu\u017f ongaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager irnpatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others werc from his guardians, the latter astoni\u017fhed bim; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, thefe seemed ta give bim sufficient reason for the beli-\nef. His guardians insisted upon his iminediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers os scdvctjon, rendered his licenlious habits moro dangerous to sociely. It had been discovered, that hif contempt for lhe adultress had not originated jn hotred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gralification, lhat his victim, the partner of hi\u017f gvilt, should be hur1ed from the pinnacle of vnsullied virtue, down lo the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom ho had sought, apparently on account of thejr virtue, had, since his doparture, thrown even lhe mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deforrnjty of their vices to the public gaze.\nAvbrey determined upon leaving one, whose oharacter had not yet shawn a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resoIved to invent some plavsible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon percoived, thal his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the iriexperience of the daughter of the lady whoso house he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it if seldom that an vnmarried femaIe ls inetwjth in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in fecret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had bcen clppointed, which would most likely end jn the ruin of an innacent, though tboughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at tho same time that he was aware os his being about to meet her that very nighl. Lord Rutbvenanswered, that his intentions were svch as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry hcr, meroly laugh ed. Aubrey retired; arid, immedjately writirig a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordshipin the remainder oftheir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seck other apartments, and oalling upon the mother of the lady, jnformed her 0s all he knew, not only with regard to herdaughter, but alsa concorning the character of his Lordship. The as signation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next doy merely sent his seruant to notify his complete asserit to a separatiori; bul did not hint any svspicion of hi\u017f plans having boen foiled by Aubrcy's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dlrected bls sleps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himf elf at Athens. He then fixed his residence in lhe housc of a Greek; and soan occupied himself ln tracing the faded records of ancient gloryupon monuments that apparently, ash-\namcd of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before s1aves, had hidden themselves bcneath the sheltering soil or many colovred liohen. Undor the same raof as himself, existed abeing, \u017fo beautisul and delicate, that she might havc formed the model for a painter wishing to povrtray on carivass the promisod hope of the faithful in Mclhomet's paradife, save that her eyes spoke loo much mind sorany one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plclin, or tripped along the movntajn's s ide, one would hove thoughl tho ga2elle a poor type of her beauties; for whowou1d haue exchanged her eye, appareritly the eye of animated nature, for that slcepy luxurious look os tbe animal suited but to the taste ofan epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and osten w0uld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of cl Kashm ere buttorfly, shaw the whole beauty of her form, sloating as it were upon the wjnd, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almosl effaced tablel, in the contomplation of her sylph-like sigure. Ofteri wovld her tresses falling, as she flitted around, oxhibit in thesun's ray such deliccltely brilliclnt and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgct-\nfulriess of tbe antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance ta the proper iriterpretation of a passage in Pavsanias. But why attempt to describe charmf which all feel, but nonc can appreciote?\u2014It was innocenee, youth, ond beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooins and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to pre\u017ferve a memorial for his suture hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, jn tra cing the scenes of her native place; she would then describo to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all thc glowing c0lourf of y0uthsul mernory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; clnd then, turning to su bjcets that had evidently made a greater iinpre\u017fsion vpon her mind, would lell him all the supernatural tales of ber nurse. Her earnestness ond apparent beIief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by fecding upon the llfe of a lovely female to prolorig his exi\u017ftence for the ensuing months, his bload wouId run cold, whilst he altempted ta laugh her oul of \u017fuch idle and horriblc fantasies; but Iaritho cited to him the names os old men,wha had at last detected one living among themselves, aster feueral of their near relativos and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend'\u017f appetite; and when sho fou nd hiin so incredulaus, fbe bogged of him to believe her, for it had been, rernarked, that those who hod dared to question their exlstence, always had \u017fome proof given, which obliged them, with grief and beart6reaking, to confess il was true. She detailed to bim the traditjonal appearance of thefe monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty aocuratc description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in porsuading her, that there cauld be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondored clt the many coincidences which had all tended to excite cl belief in the supernaturol power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himseIf more and more to Ianthe; ber innocence, so contrasted witb all the affectod virtues ofthe women among wh0m he had sought for his vlsion of romance, wan his heart; and while he ridiculcd the idecl of a young man of English ha6its, marrying an uneducatcd Groek girl, still he found himself more and rnore alta-\nched to the almosl fairy form hcfore him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquclrian researeh, he would dopart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he clIways found it impo ssible to flx his attentjon upon tho ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an lmage that seemed alone the rjghtfvl posses\u017for of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seomed to part from him with re1uctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardicln was occupied in ske tching or uncovoring somc fragment which had yet escaped the dcstructive hand of time. She had appcaled to ber parents on the su6ject of Vampyres, and they both, with severcll present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very narne. Soon after, Aubrey determined to praceedupon one 0s his excur\u017fions, which was to dctairi him for a few hours; when they heard the narne of the plclce, they alI at once beggcd of hjm not to return al nlght, as he must necessorjly pass through a wood, where no Greek wovld ever remain, after tbe day had closed, upon any confideration. They described it as theresort os the vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and denounoed the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of thelr representcltions, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder al his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNextmorning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatlended; he was surprised lo observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief af those horrible fiends, had inspired them wjth such lerror. When he wasabout to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged os him to return, ere night allowed the power of those beings to be pul in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot peroeive that day-lighl would soon end, and that in the horizori there wcls one of those specks which, inthe warmer climatos, so rapidly gather into a trernendaus inass, and pour all lheir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horfe, determined lo mclke up by speed for his delay: hut it was too late. Twilight, in thefe southerri climates, is a1most unknawn; immediately the sun sets, night begins: arid ere he had advanced far, thc power of the \u017ftorm was above\u2014its echoirig thunders had scarcely aninterval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying fo1ioge, whilst lhe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried witb dreadful rapidity tbrough the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fourid, by the glare of lightning, that ho was in the neighbovrhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself vp fr0m tho masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping t0 find some one to guide him to thc town, or at least tru\u017fting lo abtain shelter from the peltirig of lhe storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for a inamont silerit, allowed him t0 heclr the dreadful shrjeksos cl woman mirigling wilh tbe stifled, exultant mookery of cl laugh, conlinued in one almost unhroken sound;\u2014ho wos startled: but, roused by the thunder wbich again rolled over his head, he, wjth a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknefs: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceivcd; for, th0ugh be called, ftlll the sovnds contiriued, and n0 notice was taken of him. Hefound himself in contact with some orie, whom he immediatoly seized; wben a voice cried, \"Agairi baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was liftod from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon biin, and kneeling upan his breast, had placed bis hands upon his throat\u2014wheri the glare of many torches penetrating tbrovgh the hole that gavo ljght in the day, disturbed him;\u2014be instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the do0r, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through tbe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was naw stlll; and Aubrey, incapable of moving,was soon heard by those without. They entered; the ligbt of their torches fe1l upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individuol straw wilhheavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched sor her who had attraoted him by her cries; be was agoin 1est in darknes\u017f; but what was his harror,when the light os the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corso. He fhut hif eyes, hoping that it wcls but a vjsion arising from his disturbed imagination; but he agclin saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by hl\u017f sjde. There was na colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attoching as the Iife that once dwelt there:\u2014upon ber neck and breclst was hlood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men poinled, crying, simultaneous1y struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter wa\u017f quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and sairy vislons, now follen with the flower of life that had djed wilhin her. He knew not what his tboughts were\u2014hi\u017f mind was benum6ed and seemed to shun reflection, clrid take refuge in uacancy\u2014he held almo\u017ft unconsciously in hls hand a naked dagger of a particular conslruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met 6y different parties who hcld been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadsul catostrophe. \u2014To describe thejr grief would be impossibl e; but when they afcertainod thc cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to thecorse. They were inconso-\nlab1e; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed wcls sejzed witb a most violent feuer, and wa\u017f often delirious; in these intervals he wouId call upon Lord Ruthveri and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccounlable combinatiori he seemed to beg of hif former companion to spare the being he loved. At otbor tirnes he would imprecate malodictions upon his head, and curse him cls ber destroyer. Lord Ruthveri, chanced at thi\u017f time to arrive at Athe ns, and, from wbateuer motive, upon bearing of thc stclte of Aubrey, immediately placed himse1f iri the same house, and became his constant attendant. When thc latter recovered srorn his delirium, he was horrified and \u017ftartled ot the sight of him whosc image he had now combined with that os a Vampyre; but LordRuthven, by his kirid words, implying almost repentance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and still rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presenco. His lordship seemcd qvite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetio being wba had so astonished Aubrey; but as s0on os his convalescence 6egan to be rclpid, he agaln grodually retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he wcls surprised to meet his gazc fixed iritcntly upan hlm, with cl smile of malicious oxultation playlng upan his lip\u017f: he knew not why, but this smile haunted bim. During the last stoge of tbe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching thc tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in morking the progress of those orbs, circling, like ovr world, the move1ess sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was muoh weakened, and that elasticity os spirit which had once so djstinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitu-\ndc, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins ho had formerly sroquerited, Ianthe's form st0od 6y his side\u2014if he fought it in the woads, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round,would sbow, to his wjld iinagination, her paIe face and wounded throat, wilh a meek smile upon her Iips. He determined to fly scenos, overy feature of which created such bitter associatjons in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he he1d himsels bound by tbe tender care he had taken of hirn during his illness, that they fhould visjt those parts os Greece neither had yet feon. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot t0which a recollecti0n oould be attached: but though they thvs bastened fr0m pIace to place, yel they seemed not to heed what lhey gazed upon. They heard much of rohbers, 6utthcy gradually began to slight these reports, which tbey imagined were only the invention of individuals, wbose interest it was to excite the generosity of thosc whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequencc of thus ncg1ecting theadvice ofthe inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled wlth only a few guards, more to serve as guidcs than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilc, at the bottom of which was tbe hed os a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the rieighbouring precipiccs, they hod reason lo repent their negligerice; for scarcelywere the whole of the party engaged in the riarrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets clofe to thcjr heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an iristanl their guards had left them, and, placing lhomsolves behjnd rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubroy, imitating lheir example, retired for a inoment behind the sbellering turn of the defile: but ashamed of 6eing thus detained by o foe, who with insulting shouts 6ade them advance, and being exposed lo unresisting \u017flclughter, if any of thc robbers should climb above and tclke tbem in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in fearcb of the enomy. Hardly had they lost tho shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthuen reeeived a shot in the shoulder, which brought him lo the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assislance; and, no longer hceding the contest 0r his own peril, was soon surprised by seeirig lhe robbers' faccs around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arrns and surreridered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon lnduced them to convey his wounded sriend ta a nejghbouririg cabin; and having agreed vpon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being contenl merely to guard lhe entrance till thcir comrclde should return witb the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Rulhven's strength rapidly dccreased; ln two days mortification ensued, and death \u017feemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unc0nscjous of pain clf he had been of the obieots a6out him: but towards the elofe of the last evening, hls mind bocame apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Auhrey, who was lnduced to offor his assistance with more tban usual eamestness\u2014\"Asfist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more thanthat\u2014I mean not my lifc, I heed the death of my existonee as little as that of the passing day; but you may fave my h0nour, your friond'f honovr.\"\u2014\"H0w? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I rieed but little\u2014my Iife ebbs apaee\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and is my death werc unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014bvt lifc.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himseIf with exullant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes 0r death to any living being in clny way, whatovor inoy ha ppen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes soemed bursling from their sookets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laugbing upon his pillow, and breathed no mor e.\nAubrey retired to rcst, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind,ond hc knew not wby; when be rememberod hi\u017f oath a cold shivering come over him, as if from thc presonliment os something horrible awalting him. Rising early in lhe mornlng, he was about to enter the hovel jn which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and inforined him that it was no longer thore, having been oonveyed by himself arid cornrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaclc of a ncigh6ouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, lhat it shou1d be exposed to the first oold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Au6rey astonishod, and taking several of the men, determjned to go and bury it up0n the spot wbere lt lay. But, when he had mounted to the summlt he fovnd no trace of either the corpse or the clolhes, thougb the robbers swore they poinled out theidentical rock on which they had laid lhe body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, bvt he at last returned, convincod that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the cl0thes.\nWeary of a oountry iri which he had met with such terrible misfartunes, and in wbich all apparently conspired to heighton that superstitious melancholy that hadseized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ue\u017fsel to convey him t0 Otranto, or to Nap1es, he occupiod himfelf in arranging those effeels he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthv en. Amongst other things there waf a case containing several weapons of offence, more or les\u017f adapted to ensure the death of lhe victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. Whilsl turning tbem over, ond examining lheir curious forms, what was his surprise at sinding a \u017fhcath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discavered in the fatal hut\u2014he fhuddered\u2014hastening t0 gain surther proos, he sound the weapon, and his horror may be imagincd when he discovered that it fitted, lhough peculiarly shaped, tho sheath he held in hishand. His eyes seemed t0 need no furtber certainty\u2014they seemed gazingto be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished lo disbelieve; but the partieular form, the same varying tints upon tho hast and sheath were allke in sploridour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eaoh.\nHe 1eft Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had atl empted to snatcb from Lord Ruthven's seductlve arls. Hor parents were iri distress, lheir forturie ruined, and she had not been heard of \u017fince the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lody had sallen a victiin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He beeome morose and \u017filenl; and bis only occupation cansisted in urging the speod af the poftilions, as if he were going to save the lifo of some onehe held dear. He arrived at Calai\u017f; a breeze, whioh seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Eriglish shores; and he hcl\u017ftened to tho inans ion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ernbraces and cclresses 0f his sjster, all memory of lhe past. If she before, by her insantine earesses, had gaincd his affoction, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains tbe gaze and applause of tho drawing-room ossemblies. Thcre was none of that li ght brjlliclney which 0n1y exists in the heated atmospbere of a crowded aparlmcnt. Her blue eye was nevcr lit up by the levity of lhe mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it wbich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some fee1ing wjthin, that appeared ta indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not thatlight footing, which \u017ftrays where'er a butlorfly or a colour mcly attract\u2014it was sedate clnd pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, wha would baveexchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that faoe were then ploying in the lighl of their owri native sphere. Shc was yet only ei ghteen, and had riot 6een preserited to the world, il having been thought by her guardians more fit that her pre\u017fentation shouId he delayed until her brother's return fromthe continent, when he might be her prolect0r. Itwas now, tberefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was sast approaching, should be the epoeh of her entry into the \"busy feene.\" Auhrey wauld rathor have remoined in the mansion of hjsfathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolitics of fashionable strangers, when hi\u017f mjnd had becn so tarn by the events he had witnessed; bul be determined to socrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excess-\nive\u2014a drawing-room had not beeri held for a long time, and all who were anxious t0 bask in the smile af royalty, hastened thitber. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whi1c be wa\u017f standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wasin that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly selzcd by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, saunded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blasl him, when ho perceived, at a ljttle distance, tbe same figure which had attracted his notico on tbis spot upon bis first entry into soeiety. He gazod till his limbs almost refusing to bear their woight, he was obliged to take the arm of a sriend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw bimsclf into his carriage, and was driven hornc. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hand\u017f upon his head, as if he were afra id his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances slarted up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oclth.\u2014He roused himself, hc could not belicve it possi6le\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imaginati0n had conjured up thc image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that il could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he atteinplod to ask conce rning Lord Ruthven, lhe name hung upon hjs lips, and he could nat succeed in gaining information. He went a few nighlsafter with his sister to the clssembly of a near relation. Leavjng her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and thcre gove bimself up to his own devouring thoughls. Perceivirig, at last, that many were leaving, he rou\u017fed himsols, and entering another room, fovnd his sister surrounded 6y soveral, clpparently in earnest o0nversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested ta move, turnedround, and revealed to him lhose features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's clrm, and, with hurried slep, forced her towards the street: at the door he faund himself impeded 6y the crowd of servclnts who were waiting for thelr lords; and while be was engaged in passing them, he again heard thal voice whisper close to bim\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014Hc did not daro to turn, but, hurrying his fister, s0on reached home.\nAubrey became almo\u017ft dis tracled. Is before his mind had beenabsorbed by one subject, h0w much more completely was it eng ro\u017fsed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressod upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him toexplain to ber what had caused his clbrupt conduct. He only ultered a few words, and those lerrified her. The more he tbought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster lo roarn, bearing rvin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not auert its progrcss? His very sisler might hove been touched by him. But even lf he were to break hif oath, and disclose his suspicions, who wovld believe bim? He thought of employjng his own hand to free the world from \u017fuch o wretch; 6ut death, he rememberod, had been already inocked. For day\u017f he remained in this state; shul up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his slster came, wbo, with eyes slreaining with lears, bosought hlm, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillncss and solitude, he loft hls house, r oomed from stroet to street, arixiouf to fly that lmage which haunted him. Hi\u017f dres\u017f becamc rioglected, and he wandered, as often expo\u017fed to lhe noon-day sun as to the midriight darnps. He was rio longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he Iaid himdown to rest wherevcr fatigue overtook him. Hls \u017fister, anxious for his safety, employed poople to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly chclnged. Struck with the idea tbat he left by his absonce thc whole of hls friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter clgain into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forowarn, in spito of hls oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimocy. But wben be entered into a roorn, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, thal his sister was at last obIiged to beg of him to abstain from sceking, for her sake, a sociely which affected hlm so strong1y. When, however, rcmonstrance proved unclvalling, the guardians thought proper to inlerpose, and, searing that his mjnd wa\u017f 6ecoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey'\u017f pare-\nnts.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountored in his wanderings, clnd of preventirig him from ex posing to the general eye those markf of what they considered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in tbe house, and tako constant care 0f him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible \u017fubiecl. His incoherence became al laft so great, thot ho was confined to bis chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapablo of beirig roused. He had becomeemaciated, hif eyes had atlairied a glassy luslre;\u2014the only sign of affection arid recolleclion rernaining displayed itself upon the entry af his sister; then he would somolimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that sevorely afsllcted her, he wauld desire her not to toucb him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love far me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, bis only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he fank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lclsted mariy months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherenees became less frequont, and hismind threw off a portjon of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, thal several times in the day he would counl upon bis finger\u017f a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elopsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one af hls guclrdians entering his room, began to coriverse with his physician vpon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubrey'f being in so awful a siluation, wheri his sister was going noxt day to be marri ed. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxioufly to whom.Glad of lhis mark of returning inte1lect, of which they feored he bad been deprived, they mentioned the naine of the Earl of Mclrsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom be had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished thom still more by his expressing his intention t0 be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answcred not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He wcls apparontly again capable of belng affccted by tbe influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her ta his breast, and kis\u017fed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the th0ught of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted wclrmth, arid to c0ngratulate her upon her marriago wilh a pcrson so distinguished f0r rank and every accomplishmenl; when he suddenly perceived a lockct upon her breast; 0pening it, what was his surprise at beholdirig lhc features of the monster wbo hod so long influenced his life. He seizcdthc portrait ln a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him wby he thus destroyed the resem6lance of her fulure husband, he looked as is be did riot understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a srantic expression of countenance, hc bade her sweclr lhat shc would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voiee again bade him remember his oath\u2014he tvmed suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was nearhim but saw no one. In tho meantime the guclrdians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and lhought this was bvt a return of his diforder, entered, and foreing him from Mlss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them t0 delay but for one day. They, attributing tbif to the insanity lhey irnagined had takeri possession of his mind, endeavovred to pacify him, arid rotired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refvsed with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the causo of it; but when he learned that he was dcemed insane, hi\u017f exultation and plcasure could hardly he concealed fram those among whorn he had gained this lnformalion. He hastened to thc bouse af his former companion, and, by coristant atlendance, and thc pretence of great affee-\ntian for tbe brother and interest in hls fclte, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recou-\nnt\u2014could \u017fpeak of himself af of an individual having no sympalhy with any being ori tbe crowded earth, fave with her to whom he addressed himsels;\u2014could tell h0w, since he knew her, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of preseruation, if it were merely that he might lislen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so we1l how to use the serpent'f art, or such was the will of fate, that he gajried her affections. The title of the elder branoh falling at length to him, he obtoined an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the inarriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged stclte,) which was to take place the vcry daybefore hi\u017f departurc for tho continerit.\nAubrey, when he was lefl hy the physiclan and his guardians, attempted la bribe the servant\u017f, but in uain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sisler, conjvrjng her, as she valued her own happinefs, her own honour, ond the honour 0f thosc now in the grave, who once held her jn their arms as their hope and the bope of their house, to delay bvt for a few hours that morrioge, on which he denounced the most heavy cursos. The servonts pr0mised they would deliver it; bvt giving it to the ph y\u017fician, he thought it botter riot to harass any moro the mjnd of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the raving\u017f of a maniac. Night passed on wjthout rest to the busy inmates of tbe house; and Aubrey heard, with a horr0r that may mare easily be canceived lhan described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning oame, and the saund of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcamo their vigilance, they gradualIy stole awcly, Ieaving him in the custody of an belpless old woman. Hc scizcd the opp0rtunity, wlth one bourid wa\u017f out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all weronearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceiue him: he immediately approachod, and, taking bis arrn by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on lhe staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath,and know, if not my bride to day, your sister js dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saylng, he pushed him towa rds his attendant\u017f, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; hjs rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was canveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was nat present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid of agitating her. The marriage wos solemnized, and the 6ride and bridegr0om left London.\nAubrey's weakness increafed; the effvsjori of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's gvardians might be called, and when the midnight hour hcld struck, he re1ated c0mposedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardian\u017f hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when thcy arrived, it was too lote. Lord Ruthveri had disclppeared, and Aubrey's sister had g lutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'SRESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, wherc to choose his place of rest, and Pr0vidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board arie of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we pvt into the horb0ur of Mitylene, in tbe islandof lhat name. The beauty of this place, and the ccrtain supply of cattle and vcgetables always to be had there, induce many B ritish vessels to visit it\u2014bolh men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for s hips bound to Smyrna, its bounties amplyrepay for the deviation of a voyage. Wc lclnded; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men wore empl0yed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with tbc natiues, lhe clergymcln and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, whero we had been before. On the brow 0f Mount Ida (a small m0nticule so namcd) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio wlth ari English lord, who left the islarid fovr days proviaus to our arrivol in his felucca. \"He erigagcd me as a pilat,\" said tbe Greek, \"and would bove taken me wilh him; but I did not choose to quit Mityleno, where I am likely to get inarried. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he haf left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it, (abovt L250 English currency,) arid has reslded there about f0vrteen months, though not constaritly; for he sails in hi\u017f felucccl very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiasity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where ovr countryman had refided. We were kiridly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of sour apa rtments on the ground-floor\u2014an entranco hall, a drowing-room, a sitting pclrlour, and a bed-room, with a \u017fpacious closet annexed. They were all simply decoraled: ploin green-stained walls, marble lables on elther side, a large m yrtle in the centre, and cl small fountairi benealh, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa compleled the fvmiture. In the hall stood ha1f a dazen Engli\u017fh cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread ori the floor, wilh two stuffed cotton qullts arid a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, forrnerly, the old man told us, silled with books and paperf, which were thcn in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examiriing the contents. On the tablet of the rocess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and R0usscau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Katzehue's noveIs; Schiller'f play of the Robbors; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edilion, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphIetsfrom the Greek press at Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notos, written with a poncil, in Italian and Lalin. The Messiah wa\u017f literally scribbled all ouer, and marked with slips of paper, an which also were remarks.\nThe ald man said: \"The lord had been reading these bo0ks the evening besare he sailed, and fargot t0 place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, hc would frown up0n me for a week together; ho ls otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the pr0duce of thif farm sor the trouble of taking care af it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cotlage in the wood, ond wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reclson.\"\nThe appearance of the bouse externally was pleosing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and sourteen broad, and the flutcd marble pillars with black plinths and frel-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecicln architecture,) were considerab1y higher thcln tbe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrode, was c0vered by a fine Turkoy carpot, benealh an awning of strong coarse lin en. Mosl of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoylng the evening brecze.\nOn the left hand cls we entered the house, a small streamlet glided awcly, grapes, oranges and limes were clusterlng together on its borders, and under the shade of two Iarge myrtlo bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings arid nights till twelve o'cl0ck, r eading, writing, ond talking to himse1f. \"I suppose,\" said tbe old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our chureh twice a week, befides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A linc of rich vineyards lod the eycto Mount Calcla, couered with olive and myrtle t reos in bloom, and on the summit of whicb ari aricient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smallstream issujng from the ruiris descended in broken cclscades, until it was last in the waods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth cls glass, and an horizon unshadowed hy a single oloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries wcre frvitless as t0 the naine of the pcrson who had resided in this roinantic solitude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Candla. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could telI, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I daro not.\" We had nol time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt feveral particularf of the isolated lard. He had portioned e ight young girls when he was last upon the island, and euen daneed with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to lhe girls who liue by weoving these articlcs. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had Iosl his own in a gale, and ho often gave G reek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and 6enevolent character. One circumstance we lcornt, which our old friend at the coltage thought propor not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on tho sea-shore, and he had bought ber a piano-forlc, and taught her himself tho use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departod from tbe peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginatioris oll on the rack, guessing wh0 tbis rambler in Greece could be. He had moriey it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposilion, and aIl those eccenlrieities which mark peculiar goriius. Arrived at Palermo, a1l our dovbts were di\u017fpellod. Falling ln compariy wilh Mr. FOSTER, thc architect, a pupil os WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greoce, \"The individual,\" said he, \"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met himin my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also vislted him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's famc, as we had been some years from h0me; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hclnds we recognized the recluse af Calcla in evcry page. Deeply did we regret not having been moro curious in our researches at the cotlage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some fvture day; but ta me that day will neuer retum. I make thi\u017f statement, believing it not qu ite uninteresling, and ln iustice to his lordship's good name, which has beeri grossly slaridered. He has been described as of ari unfeeling disposition, averse to assoeiating with huinan nature, or c0ntri6uting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The facl i\u017f djrectly the reverso, as may be plainly gathered from these llttle anocdotes. All the finer feeling\u017f of the heart, so elegantly depicted in hif lordship's poems, seem to have thelr seat iri his bosam. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his aotions: and his courting lhe repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking hiin as a being on wbose heart Religjon hath set her seal, and over whose hcad Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countrymari. With respecl to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to givo an opinion. Rcports are euer to be reeeived with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who daresjustify himself before that awful lribuna1 where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character if worlhy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approuing conscience.\nTHE END\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","40":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstitlon upon wbioh this tale is founded is very generol in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: lt did nol, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after lhe eslablishment of Chrlstianity; and it has only assurned its present form since the division of the Latin and Grcek churches; at which time, the idea bceoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in thcir territory, it grcldually jncreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful ftories, still extant, 0f the dead rising from their graves, andfeeding upon the blo0d of the y0ung and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, lhat vampyres nightly imhibed a certain portion of the blood of thoir uictims, wbo became emaciclted, lost their ftrength, clnd speedily died of consumptions; whilst these huinan blood-suckers fatteried\u2014and their veins bccarne distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow fram all the passagef of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Jovmal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accauntof a particular case of uampyrism, whicb is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Itoppeors, that upon an cxamination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates af the plaee, they positively and unanimous1y affirmed, that, about five years before, a oertaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Scrvia, hc had 6een tormented by a vampyre,bvt had fovnd a way lo rid him\u017felf of the evil, by eatirig some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, clnd rub6ing himself with bis blo0d. This precaution, howevcr, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, abovt twenly or lhirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tarmented 6y him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been dcprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mjschief, the inhahitants hclving consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed lo be usual in cclses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and cmitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure clnd florid blood. Proof havirig been thus oblairied, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A ftake was driven entirely thr0vgh the hcart and body os Arnold Paul, at which hc is reported to have cried aut as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cutoff his hoad, burned his body, and threw thc ashes into his grave. Thesame measures were adopted with the corfes of those persons who had previou\u017fly djed from vampyrisrn, lest they shauld, in their lurn, become ogents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal heliefis, that a person sucked by a vampyre bccomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hjs turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade if here relaled, becaufo it seems better adapted to illustrate tho subject of the present observalions than any other instance whieh c0uld be addvced. In many parts of Greece it is c0nsidered os a sort of punishment aftcr death, for some heinous crirne cominitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compeIled to confine his infernal visitations \u017folely to those beirigs he loved most while upon carth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties ofkindrod and affection.\u2014A supposition allvded to inthe \"Giaour.\"\nBut first oneartb, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from jts tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt lhe native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of 1jfe; Yel loathe the banquet whioh perforce Must feed thy livid liuing corse, Thy victims, ere lbey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one lhat for thy crime must foll, The youngesl, bcst heloved of alI, Shall bIess thee with a fother's name\u2014 Thatward shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's Iast tinge\u2014her cye's last spark, And lhe last glassy glanoe musl view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her ye1low hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affecti0n's fondest pledge was worri\u2014 But now ls borne away by lhee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thlne own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till lhese in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also introduced in his wild bul beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the varnpyre corse of thc Arclbiari maid Oneiza, who is represented as hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hjm she best loved whil\u017ft in existence. But this cannot be supposed to hove resulted from the sinfulness of hcr life, \u017fhe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a completetype of purity and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which hc pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a varlety of anecdotes, and traditionary narralives illustrative of itf effects, has put forth fome learned dissertatlons, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMariy curious and interesting noticos on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for thc limits of a note, necessarily devoted toexplanation, and which may now be ooncluded by merely remarking, that though the torm Vampyre if the one ln most generaI acceptati0n, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of lhe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of lhe dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at lhe vclriovs parties of the leodors os the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. Ho ga2ed upon the mirth arourid him, cls if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of lhe fair only attraoted his attenlion, thal be might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thought1essness reigned. Those who felt this scnsatjon of awe, could not explajn whence it arose: some attrlbuted it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem lo penetrate, and at one glance to pierce throvgh to the inward workings of the heart; bul fel1 upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pasf. His peculiaritjes causod him ta be invited to every bouse; all wishedto see hirn, arid thase who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in thcir presence capable of engaging thcir attentiori. In spite of the deadly hue of hif face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emotion os passlon, thoughits form and out line wore beautiful, many of the femolc hunters afler notorietyattempted to win his attentions, and gain, at lcast, some marks of what they might term affoction: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every rnonster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and did all bvt put an the dressof a mountebank, to attract his notiee:\u2014lhough in uain:\u2014when she stood before hirn, though hi\u017f eyes were apporently fixed up0ri her's, still it seemed as if they were unporceived;\u2014even her uriappalled impudenco was bafflcd, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eye\u017f, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such wcls the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that sew knew he ever addressed himself lo females.He had, however, the reputati0n of a winning tongue; and whctherlt wcls thclt itoven overoame the dread of his singular charaeter, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was a\u017f oftcn among those females who form the b0ast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who suIly it by their vices.\nAbo ut the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: he was an orp ban left with an only sister in tbe possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guclrdians, who thougbt it their duly iner ely to tako care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit charge of hjs mind lo the care of inercenary subolterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judginent. He had, hence, thal high romclntic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many millincrs' apprentices. He be1ieved all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vicewas lhrown in by Providence morely for the picturesque effecl of the scene, as we soe in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consifted in the vestjng of clothes, w hich wero as warm, 6ut which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, iri fine, that the dreams of poets were the realitles of life. He was handsome, frank, and ricb: for these reosonf, upon his eritering into the gay circles, moriy mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with leasl truth their languisbing or romping favourites: the daughterf at the sarne time, bytheir brightening cauntenance\u017f when he opproached, and by their fparkling eyes, whcn he opened hjs lips, soon led him inlo falsc notions of his talents and hls merit. Attached as he was to thc rornance of his \u017folitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except inthe tallow and wax candles that flickered, nat from tho prcsence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptj0ris conlained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, \u017fome compensation in his gratified vanily, be was about t0 rclinquish his droams, when the exlraordinary being we have above describcd, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossjbility of formirig an idea os the character of o man entirely absorbed in himself, wha gave few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing thclt flottered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather tban the person before him. He became acquainted wilh him, paid him attentions, and \u017fo far advanced upori his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, clnd soon found, from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Slreet, that he was abaut to travel. Desirous of gairiing some informalion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was tirne f0r him to perform the tour, whjch for many generations has been thought riecessary to enable the young to lake some rapid fleps iri the career of vice lowards putting themselves upon on cquality with the aged, and nol allowing lhem to appear as if fallen fram the skies, wheriever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: arid Aubrcy immedialely mentioning his intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from him, who, apparenlly, had nothing in c ommon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circlirig watcrs.\nHitherto, Avbrey had hadno opportunity of studyirig Lord Ruthven's choracter, and now he found, that, thougb many rnore of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conolusioris from thc apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagaband, and the beggor, received from his hand rnore than enough torelieve thcjr imrnediate wants. But Aubrey could notavoid rcmarking, that it was not upon the virluous, reduced to indigence by the misfartunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sentfrom the door with hclrdly suppres\u017fed sneers; 6ut when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his l ust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniqulty, he was serit away witb rich charity. This wos, however, altribvted by him to lhe greoter importunity of the viciovs, which gcnerally prevajIs over the retiring bashfulness of the virtu0us lndigent. There was one circurnstance about the charity of bis Lord\u017fhip, which was still more impressed upori his mjnd: all lhose vpon whom it wasbestowed, ineuitably found that there was a curse upori it, for they wcre all either led to the scasfold, 0r sunk to the lowest and thc most clbiect misery. At Brvssels and other towns through wbich lhey paf\u017fed, Aubrey was surprized at tbe apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gainbled wjth success, except where the knowri sharper was his antagonist, and then he lo\u017ft even more thon he gained; but it was always with the fame unchanging face, with which be generally watched the society around: lt was not, howeuer, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or theluckless fathcr of a numerous family;then his very wish seemed forturie's law\u2014this apparent abstractednessof mjnd was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled wilh more fire thon that of the cat whilst da llying with tho half-dead mouse. In every town, he loft the farmerly affluent youtb, lorn from the circle he adorned, cursirig, in tbe soljtude of a dvngeon, the fato that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilsl many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking laoks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their prcsent cravlng. Yet he look no money from the gamb1ing table; but irnmedialely lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from lhe canuulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a ccrtairidegree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of combating lhe cunning of the more experienccd. Avbrey osten wished to represent this to his fricnd, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he de1ayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his sriend would give him somo opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; h0wever, thisnever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes 0f nature, was olways the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the objeel of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the eonstant excitement of vairily wishirig to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume thc appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorlals 0f another almost deserted city. Whilsthe was thus engaged, lctters arrived fram England, which he opened with eoger impcltience; the first was from his si\u017fter, broathing nothing but affeclion; the atbers were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it hod before ontered into his imaginatjon thal there was an evil power rosident in bis componion, these seemed lo gjve him sufflcient reoson for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, andurged, that his character was dreadfully vici ous, for that the possession of irroslstiblo powers of seduction, rendered his licontious habils more dangerouf to society. It had been disoovered, that his c0ntempt for the adultress had not originated in halred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance hi\u017f gratificati0n, that his victim, the parlner of bis gui1t, shovld be hurled fromthe pinriacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degra dation: in sinc, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on aceount os their virtue, had, since hls departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformily of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character hcld not yet shown a fingle bright poirit on which to rest the eye. He resolved to inventsome plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposirig, in tbe rncon while, to watch himmore closely, clnd to let no slight circumslances pa\u017fs 6y unnoticed. He entered into the same circlc, and soon pereeived, that hjs Lordship was cndeavouring to work upon lhe inexpcrience of tho daughter of the lady whose house he chjefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarrled female is inet wilh in society; he wcls therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrcy's eyefollowed him in clll his windings, and soon discovered that an assigriation had been appolnted, which would most likely end in the ruln of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abrvptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing bim at the same time lhat he was aware of his heing clbout to mcet ber that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thal his intenlions were such as he suppos ed all would bave upon such an 0ccafion; and upon being pressed whether he lntended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, imrnediately writing a note, t0 say, that srom that mornent hc must docline accompanying his Lordshlp in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant lo seek other apartmerits, arid cclllirig upon the motber of the lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lord\u017fhip. The assignation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servarit to notify hi\u017f camplete assent to a separalion; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans havirig been soiled by Aubrey's interp0sition.\nHav ing 1eft Rome, Aubrey directed his stepstowards Greece, ond crossing lhe Pcnin\u017fula, soon found himself at Athens. He thon fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occvpied himself in tracing the faded records of clncient glory upon monuments lhat apparently, afhomed 0f chronicllrig tbe deeds of froemen only before slaves, had hidden themsolves beneath the sholtering soil or mclny coloured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself, existed a being, so beautlful and delicate, thal she might have formed the model for a pai-\nntcr wisbing to povrlray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet'\u017f paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any orie to think she could belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced upon lhe plain, or tripped olong the mountain's side, 0ne would have thought the gazel1e a poor type os her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eycof animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the ariimaI suited but to the tasto ofan epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, origaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, fhow the wholo beauty of her form, floating cls it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze os blm, who forgot the letters hc had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the conlemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would ber tre\u017fscs falling, as she flitted arovnd, exhibit iri the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it mjght well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he bad before lhought of vital imporlance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreoiate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffeeted by crowded drawing-room\u017f and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wifhed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of hi\u017f pericil, in tracing the scenes af her nativeplace; she wovld then describe to him thecircling dance upon tbe open pIain, would paint, to him in aIl the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in ber infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impre\u017fsion upon her mind, would telI bim all the superriatural ta1os of her riurse. Her earnestness and apparent 6elief of whol sbe narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often os she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femole to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh hor out of such ldle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at laft detected one living among thomselves, afterseveral 0s their near relatives and childrcn had been found marked witb the stamp of lhe fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe hor, for it had been, remarked, that lhose who had darcd to questiori theirexistence, always had some proof givcn, which obliged them, with grief and heart6reaking, to oonfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of lhese monstcrs, and his horror was inoroafed, by hearing a pretty accurate d escription 0f Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that lhere could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he w0ndered at the many coincidenccs whieb had all tended to excite a beljef in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey heganto attach himself more and more to Iarilhe; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women amorig whom he had sought for his vision of romance, w0n his hcart; clnd while he ridiculed the ideaof cl young man os English habits, marryirig an uneducatedGreok girl, still he found himself more and more cltlached to tho almost fairy form hefore him. He would lear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to retu m until his ohjecl waf attaincd; buthe always found itimpossible to fix his atlention upori lhe rvins around him, whjlst in his mirid he retoined on image lhat seemed alone thc rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthc was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctarice; but it was becouse she had n0 longer any one witb whom she could visit her favouritc haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in sketching or vncovering some fragment which had yet efcaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with scveraI present, affirmed their existence, pale with horr0r at lhe very nome. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when thoy heard the name of the placc, they all at once begged of him not to rot urn at night, as he inust necessarily pass through a waod, whcre no Greek w0uld ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any confideration. They describod it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturncll orgies, and denouneed the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cro\u017f\u017f their pclth. Aubrey made light of their rcpresentations, and tried to lclugh them out of thc idea; but when ho saw them shudder at his daring thu\u017f to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name af whicb apparently mado their blood freeze, he was sllenl.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon bjs exoursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was coneerried tofjrid that his words, inocking the belief of lhose horrible fiends,had inspired tbem with such terror. When he wasabout to dcpart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly beg ged of him to return, ere nigbt allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupjed in his research, that he did not perceive lbat day-Iight w0uld soon end, and that in the horizon therc was one of those specks which, in the warrnerclimates, so rapidly gather inta a tremendovs mass, and pour all thcir rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make upby speed sar bis delay: but it was too late. Twilight, inthese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced fclr, the power of the storm was abave\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of reft\u2014its thick heavy rain sorced itf way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue sorked lightning seemed to fall arid radlate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with droadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The clnimal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hclrdly lifted itself up frorn the masscs of dead leaues and brusbwood which surroundcd it. Dismounting, he approaohed, hoping to find some one to guide hjm to the town, or at loast trusting to obtain shelter from the peltlng of the storm. As he approached,the thunders, for a moment silerit, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockory of a laugh, continu ed in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whlch agajn rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, foreed open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknes\u017f: the sound, however, gulded him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he oalled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom be immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and ho felt himseIs grappled by one whose \u017ftrength seerned superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormou\u017f force agalnst the ground:\u2014his eriemy tbrew himself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glclre of mclny torehes penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly r0se, and, leaving his prey, rushed throughthe doar, and in a inoment the erasbing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now sti l1; and Aubrey, jncapable of moving, was soon heard by those with0ut. They entered; tho light 0f their t0rches fell upori the mud walls, and the lhatch laadcd on every individual straw with heavy flakes os foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searcbed for her who had attracled him by her cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but whot was his horror, wheri the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduetress brovght in a lifeless c orse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was bul a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw lhe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by hisside. There was no colour upan her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stil1ness about her face that seerned almost as attaching as the life lhat once dwelt there:\u2014upori her neck and breast was bIood, and upon her tbroat were tho marks of teelh hauing opened the voin:\u2014tothis lhe men pointed, crying, simultoneously struck wilb horror, \"A Vampyre! a Varnpyre!\" A litter was quickly forrned, and Aubrey was laid by the side of ber wh0 had lately been t0 bim the object of so many bright and sairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise tbat had died within her. He kriew nat whot his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed arid seerned lo shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a parlicular construction, which had heen found in the hut. Thcy were soon mel by different parlies who had boen engaged in the scarch of her wham a mother had missed. Their 1amentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be iinpossible; but when they ascertained lhe cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to tbe corse. They were inconso1able; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey bejng put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in lhese intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by somc unaecountahle eombincltion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. At ather times he would imprecate maledictions upon his heod, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rvlhvcn, chonced at this time to arrjve at Athens, and, from whatever molive, upon hearirig of the state of Aubrey, immedialely p1aced himself in the same hou\u017fe, and became bls constant attendant. When the lattcr recovered from his delirium, ho was horrified and startled ot the sight of him whose image he had now combiried with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault lbat had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled him to his preserice. Hi\u017f lordship seemed quite changed; he no longcr appeared lhat apathetic being who had so aftonished Auhrey;but as soon as his convalescence began to ho rapid, he again graducllly retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, cxcept that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intent1y upon him, witb a smilo of malicious exultatian playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but thif smile haunted him. During the last stage osthe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparenlly engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in markjng the progress of those orbs, circling, like ovr world, the movelef\u017f svn;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyesof all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waf much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whiohhad once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was naw as mucha lover of solilude and silence as Lord Ruthven;but much as he wifhed for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood 0s Athens; if he soughl it amjdst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's forin stood by his side\u2014if he \u017fought lt in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst tbe uriderwood, in quest of tbe modefl violet; then suddenly tur-\nning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pclle face and wounded throat, with ameek smile upon herlips. He determined to sly scenes, every feature of which crcaled such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender oare he had taken of him duririg his illness, that they should visit thofe parts os Greece nejther had yet seen. Thoy travelled in every direction, clnd sought every spot to which a recollcction could be attached: but thougb they lhus ha\u017ftened framplace to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began lo sligbt these roports, which they irnagjned were only the invention of jndividuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of thase whom lhey defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jnhabitants, on one ocoasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve a\u017f guides than as a defence. Upon enlering, h0wever, a narrow defile, at the bottorn of which was lbe bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from the nelghbouring precipices, they had reason to repent thelr negligence; for \u017fcarcely were the whole of the party engaged in tbe narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and hy the echoed report of feveral guns. In an instant their guards hcld left them, and, placing themsolves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating thcir example, retircd for a moment bebind the sheltering turn of the desile: but ashclmed of being thus detained by a fae, who wlth insultjng shovts bade them advance, and being cxposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once lo rush forword ln searcb of the enerny. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rvthven received a sbot in tho shou1der, which brought him lo thc ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance;and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surpri\u017fed by seeing lhe robbers' faces arovnd hjm\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, iminediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promi\u017fes of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his woundod friend to a neighbouring cabin; and bavirig agreed upon a ransom, hewas no more djsturbed by thejr presenco\u2014they being eontent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promi\u017fed sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ru thven's strength rapidly docreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appeararice had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objecls about him: but lowards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent1y uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his as\u017fistance wilh more lhan usual earne\u017ftness\u2014\"Assist me! you may saveme\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my 1ife, I heed the deoth os my existence as littIe as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's bonour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs clpace\u2014I cannot expIain the whole\u2014but if yav would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain ln the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown sor some timo in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"Il shall nat be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himseIf with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all yaur nature sears, swear tha t, for a year and a day yau will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from thejr sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubroy; he sunk loughi ng upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rctired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumslances attending his acquaintance wjth this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not wby; when he remernbered hif oath o cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of somethinghorrible awaiting him. Rising early in tho morning, he was about lo enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a ro bber met him, and lnformed him that it was no longer thero, having been conveyed by hjmse1f and comrades, upon bis retiring, to the pinriao1e of a neighbouring mount, clccordingto a promise they had given his lordship, lhat it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rosc after his deatb. Aubroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot whore it lcly. But, when he hadmounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though tho robhers sw0re they pointed out the idenlical rock on whieh tbey had laid the body. For a time his rnind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lost returned, convinced lhat they had buried tbe corpsc for the sake of tbe clothes.\nWeary of a country inwbich he hadmet with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that svperstitious melancholy that had seized upon bis mind, he rosolved to leave it, clnd soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vesseI to canvey him ta Otrarito, or to Naples, he oocvpied himself in arrangjng thoseeffects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst otber things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or lessadapted to ensure the death of the victim. Therc were several daggers and alaghans. Whilst turningthem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath opparontly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in lhe fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014bastening to gain further proof, befound the w eapon, and his horror may be imagincd when he discavered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath hc held iri his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014thoy seemed gazing to he bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particulor form, the same varylng tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left rio roorn for doubt; tbere were alfo drops of blood on oach.\nHe left Smyma, and an his way bome, at Rome, his first inquirjes were concernlng the lady he had attemptcd to snatch srom Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not bcen beclrd of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; be was afrold thal thjs lady had fallen a victimto the destroyer of Ianthe. He becclme morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, af lf he were g0ing to save thelife of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to bis will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hastened lo the mansion of his father\u017f, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of hjs sistcr, all memory of the past. If she be fore, by her infariline caresse\u017f, hcld gained his affection, now that tho woman began t0 appear, she was \u017ftill inoro attaching as acompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had nol that winning grace whlch goins the gaze and applause 0f the drawing-room assemblies. Thero waf none of that light brilliancy which only exists jn the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her bluo eye was never lit up by the levity of tho mind beneath. Therc was a meIancholy charm about it which did not soem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeIing within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her slep was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014il was sodate arid pensive. When cllone, her faoe wos never brightened by the smile of joy; bvt wheri her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she kncw destroyed bis rest, who would havc excharigod her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face wero then playing in the lighl of their own native sphere. She was yel only eighteen, ond had n0t been prosented to the world, it having been thougbt by her guardians more fit that ber presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved thclt the noxt drawing-room, wbich was fclst appraaching, shovld be the epoch of her entry irito the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather hove remained in tho mansion of his sather\u017f, and fed upon the melancholy which overpawered him. He could not fcel interest clb0ut the frivolities of fashionoble strangers, when his mind had been fo torn by the events he had witriessed; but hc determined to sacrifice hif own comfort to the protection of his sister. They \u017foon arrived in lown, and prepared for the next day, which had 6een announccd as a drawing-rooin.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long tiine, and all wbo were anxiovs ta bask in the smile of r0yalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister.While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of clll oround him, engaged in the remembrance that the sirsl tjme he hcld seen Lord Ruthven was in that veryplace\u2014he feIt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oclth.\" He bod hclrdly courage to turn, fearful os sceing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little dislclnce, the same fjgure wbioh had attracted hi\u017f notice on this spot upon his first onlry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing lo beor their weight, hc wos obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven homc. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, and fixed hls bands upon his head, as if he were afrclid his thoughts were bursting fr0m hjs brairi. Lord Ruthven again besore him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he couId not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was restjng upon. It was impossiblc thatlt eould be rea 1\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for tbough he oltempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the namo hung upon his lips, and he could n0t succeod in gainirig information. He went a sew nights after with his sjster to thc assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under lheprotection of a rncltron, he retired inlo a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he r0used himself, and entering another room, found his sister svrrounded by \u017feveral, apparently in earnest eonversation; he attempted topass and get near her, when one, whom be requested to move, turned rovnd, and revealed to him those fealures he most ahhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced ber towards the ftreet: at the door he f0und himself impeded by the crowd of scrvants who were waiting for their lords; and while hc was engaged in pafsing them, he again heard that voice whispor close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became alm0stdistracted. If before his mirid had been absorbed by one subjeet, how much more cainplete1y was it engros sed, now that the cerlainty of the monster's living again presfed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions wore now unheeded, and it was in vain that she introated him to explain to her what had caused his obrupt conduct. He only utlered a few words, arid those terrified her. Tho more he thovght, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monsler to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and nat avert itspragress? His uery slster might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discl0se his suspicions, who would bclieve him? He thought of emp1oying his own hand to free thc world from such a wretch; but death, he remembored, hcld been already mocked. For days he remained in thls state; shvl up in his raom, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister carne, who, with eyes strearning with tears, besought him, for her sake, to fupport nature. At lasl, no longer capable of bearing stillnes\u017f and solitude, he left bis houso, roamed from street to streot, anxiovs to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandored, as often exposcd to the rioon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; at first he returncd with the evenirig to lhe housc; but at last he laid hjm down to re\u017ft wherever faligue overtook him.Hi\u017f sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wore soon distanced hy him who fled from a pursuer swlfter thari any\u2014fr0m thought. His conduct, however, sudden1y changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend ainongst tbem, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hjs oath, all whom Lord Rvthven approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspjciovs looks were so strikirig, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister waf at lasl obliged ta beg of him to ahstain from seeking, for her sake, a sacietywhich affected bim so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, searing that his mind was bec0ming alienated, they thought it high lime to resume again thal trusl which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's pclrents.\nDesirausof saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to tbe general eye those marks of what they confidered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conftant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely wcls his mind clbsorbed by one terribIc subjeet. Hjs incohererice became at last so great, that he waseonfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapablo of bei ng roused. He had bccome emaciated, hjs eyes had atlained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remcljning difplayed itself vpon the eritry of his sister; then he would fometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afslicted her, he would desire her riot lo touch him. \"Oh, do riot touch him\u2014if your love for me i\u017f aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, shc inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many month\u017f: gradvally, howeuer, cls the year was passing, his incoherenees bccame loss frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its glaom, whjlst his guordions observed, thal several limes intbe day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and theri smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last doy af the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melclnchaly circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awsuI a situatlori, whcn his sister was going next day to be married. InstantIy Aubrey's attenlion was altracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of lhis mark of returning intellect, of which lhey feared hc had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the EarI of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonjshed them \u017ftill more by hls expressirig his intention to be preserit at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, bvt ln a few minut es his sister was with him. He was apparently again capa6le of being affected by the influence of her Iovely smlle; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing ot the thought of her brolher's being oncc more alive to tho feolings of affeclion. He began lo speclk with all his wonted warmth, and to congralu1ate her upon her marriagc with a person so distinguished for rank and everyaccompIishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast;opening it, what was his surprise at beh0lding the features of the m0nster wbo had sa long jnfluenced his life. He seized the portrclit in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplod it under fool.Upon ber asking hirn why he tbus destroyed the resemblonce of her future husband, he looked as if he did nol understand her\u2014then sejzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression os countenance, he bade her swear that she would riever wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him rememberhis oath\u2014he turried suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lhe meantime the guardjans and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entored, arid f0rcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon bis knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They,attribvtlng this to the insanity thoy imagined had taken possesfion of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had cal1ed the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with cvery one else. Whcn he heard of Avbrey's ill health, ho readily understood himself to be the couse of it; but when he loarned thal he was deemed insane, his exultotion arid pleasure could hard1y be concealed from those am0ng whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brolher and interest in his fate, he gradvally won the eclr of Mlss Aubrey. Who could reslst his power? His tongue had dangersand toils ta recount\u2014could speak of himself as af an individual having no sympathy with ariy being on the crowded earth, save wilh hor to whorn he addressed himself;\u2014could tellhow, since he knewher, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listori to ber soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how lo use the serpent's art, or fuch wos the will of fate, that he gained her affcctions. Tbe title of the eIder brarich falling at length to him, he obtclined an important embasfy, which servedas an excuse for hastening tbe marriage, (in spite os her 6rother's deranged state,) which was ta take place the very day before bis departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by lhe physioian and his gu ardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pon and paper; it was gjven him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuririg ber, as sbe valued ber own bappiness, her own honour, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held her in thelr arms as their hape and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heauy curses. The servanls promised they would deliver it; but giuing it ta the physician, he thought it better not to harclss any more the mind of Miss Aubrey hy, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed onwithout rest ta the bvsy ininates of the house; and Aubrey heard, witb a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of 6usy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe curiasity of lhe scrvants at last overcame their vigiIance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the oustody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, ond in a momentfound himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was tbe first to perccive him: he immcdiateIy approachcd, arid, taking his arm byforce, hurried hiin from the rooin, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whjsperedin his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brido to day, your sister is di\u017fhonoured. Women are frail!\" So soying, he pushed him towards his attendonts, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer supporl himself; his rage not firiding vcnt, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was canveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, os the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemriized, and the bride and bridegroom lcft London.\nAubrey's weakness iricreased; thc effusion of blood produced symptoms of tbe near clpproach of death. He desired his sister's guardlans might be oaIled, arid when lhe midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died imrnediately after.\nThe guardians ha\u017ftened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wheri they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had djsappoared, and Aubrey's sisler had glutted the t hirst os a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESID ENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Theworld was all before him, wbere to chooso hif place of rest, and Providence his gvide.\"\nIN Sailing through lbe Grecicln Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vesself, in thc year 18l2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island ofthal name. Thc beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce manyBritish uessels ta ujsit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lief rather out of the track for ship\u017f bound to Smyrna, its bountjes amply repay for the devlatiori of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself taok a ramble to the cove called Homer's School, and other places, whcre we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticulc so named) we met wjtb and en gaged a young Greek as our guide, who t01d us he bad come froin Scio wltb an Eng1ish lord, who left tbe island four days previous to our arrival in his fclucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sajd the Greek, \"and wovld haue taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, bvt a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the rjver, bclongs to him, and he has left ari old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wino-trader, six hundrod zechines for it, (ahout L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not oonstantly; for hc sails in his fclucca very often to the difserent islands.\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the h0vse where our countryman had resided. We were kindIy received 6y an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It con\u017fisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-roam, a sitting pclrlour, and a hed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They wero all simp1y decorated: plain green-stained walls, marb1e lables on either side, a large myrtle in lhe conlre, and a smclll fountoin beneath, which cou1d be made to play through lhe branches by movirig a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Vonus in a leaning postvro; a large oouch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an emply book-cose: there wero no mirr0rs, nor a single painting. The bedchamber hcld merely a large matt ress spread on the floor, with two \u017ftuffed cotton qvilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sittlng-room we observed a morble recess, formerly, tbe old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which werc then in a largc seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think oursolves justified in examining the conterits. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeclre's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's works complete; Volney'fRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in lhe German languoge; Klapsloek's Messiah; Kotzebue's novols; Schjller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradise Lost, ari Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; seueral small pamphlets from the Groek press at ConstantiriopIe, much torn, but no English book of any dcscriplion. Most of these books were filled with rnarginal notes, written with cl peneil, in Italion and Latin. The Messiah was 1iterally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been read-\nirig these books tbe evening before he sajled, and forgot to place them with the othors; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week togethcr; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, excepl twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small c0ttage in the wood, and whom the lord brought berc from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThc appearance of the bouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces lorig and fourteenbroad, and the fluted mclrble pjl1ars with hlack plinths and fret-work cornjces, (as it is now customary in Grecian architectvre,) wore considerab1y higher than the roof. The roof, surrourided by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnisbed, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smok ing, drinking light wines, svch as \"lachryma ehristi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evenirig breeze.\nOn lhe left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under lbe shade of two large myrtlc hushes, a marble scat with an ornainental wooden back waf placod, on which we were told, lhe lord passed many of his evcnings and nights till twe1ve o'clook, reading, writirig, and talking to himself. \"I suppase,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for hewas very devout, \"and alwoys attended our ehurch twice a week, be\u017fides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew from thisseat was whal may be termed \"a 6ird's-eye view.\" A line os rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covored with olive and myrtle treos in bloom, and on the summil ofwhich an ancienl Grcek temple appeared in majestic deccly. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the inountain's base. The sea smootb cls gla\u017fs, and an horiz0n urishadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; clnd a little ori the left, through a vista of lofty chesnul ond palm-trces, several smclll i\u017flands were distinctly observed, studding the light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view rnare than I did this; but our enqvirles were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am svre he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you telI, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I cari,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visjt the Armenicln, but on our return to the town we learnl severaI partlculars of the isolaled lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was la\u017ft upon tbe island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gove a cow to one man, h0rses lo others, and ootton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman wbo had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared lo us, from oll we collccted, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstanco we leamt, which our old frierid at lhe cottage thougbt proper nat to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, wilh wh0m the lord was often seenwalking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taugbt her bimself the use of it.\nSuch was the inforrnatiori with which we dcparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rclck, guessing who tbis rambler in Greece could be. Hc had monoy it was evident: he had philarithropy of disposition, and alI those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrivod at PaIormo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, tbe architect,a pvpil of WYATT'S, who had been trave1ling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individuol,\" said he, \"about whom you ore so anxious, is Lord Byron; Imet him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hclnds we recognized lhe rccIuse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regrot not having been more curious in our researcbes at the cottage, but we confoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some suture day; but to me that day wi1l never retvrn. I make thif statement, bolieving il not qvite uninteresting, and in iustice tohjs lordship's g0od name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, clverse to assoclating with human nature, or contributing in any way to s0oth its sorrows, or add to ils pIeasures. The fact is directly the rever\u017fe, as may be plainly gathered from these litlle onecdates. All the finer feeljngs of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat iri his bosom.Tenderness, sympalhy, and charity appear to gujde all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitvde is an cldditional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Rellgion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benovolcnce hath thrown her mantle. No inan can read the preceding pleasjng \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever t0 be received with cclutiori, particularIy when directed against man's moral irilegrity; and he who dares justify himself beforc that awful trihunal where all mu\u017ftappear, alone may censure thc errars of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worlhy of his genius. T0 do good in secrct, and shun the world's applause, is tbe surest testirnony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.","41":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Williclm Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very gencral in the East. Ainong lhe Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, oxtoriditself to tbe Greeks until after the establishment of Chrlstianity; and it has onIy assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which tlme, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could riot corrvpt if bvried in their territory, it gradualIy increased, ond formed lhe subject of many wonderfuI stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the yovng and beautiful. In tbe West it spread, with f0me slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrajne, where the bolief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of theirvlctims, who became emaeiated, losl their slrength, and specdily died of consumptions; whilst thesehuman blood-suckors fatlened\u2014clnd their veiris became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their 6odies, and even srom the very pore\u017f of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular ccl\u017fe of vampyrlsm, which is stclted to havo occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-ehief and magistrates af the place, they posilively and unanjmously affirmed, that, abovt five yearsbefare, a certain Heyduke, nclmed Arnold Paul, had been heard to scly, that, at Cassovicl, on tho fronliers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had fovnd a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth ovt of the vampyre'\u017f grave, and rubbinghimself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not preuent him from becoming a vampyre himsels; for, abovt lwenty or thirty days aftor his death and burial, many personscornplained of having been tormented by him, ond a deposition was mode, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mi\u017fchief, the inhabitants havi ng consulled tbeir Hadagni, taok vp the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual jn cases of vampyrisrn) fre\u017fh, and entirely freefrom corruplion, clnd emitling al the mouth, nosc, and ears, pvre and florld blood. Proof having been thus obtclined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried 0ut as dreadfully as is he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they sh0uId, in their turn, become agents upan 0thers who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person svcked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hif turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstr0us rodomontade i\u017f bere relatcd, becaufe it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observotjons tban any other instance which could be adducod. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishmerit after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the decea\u017fed is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to corifine his infernal visitations \u017folely to those beingshe loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he wasbound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A suppositionalluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut fjrst on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt lhe native place, And suck the blo0d of all thy race; There from thy daughter, slster, wife, At rnidnight drain the stream of llfe; Yet loclthe the banquct which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy viclims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursjng thoe, thou eursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one thal for thy crimo must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee wilh a father's na me\u2014That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's 1clst \u017fpark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The trefses 0f her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shom Affection'\u017f fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is bome away hy thee Mcinorjal of thine agony! Yet witb thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing to0th, and haggard lip; Tben stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and wlth Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in borror shrink away From spectre more aocur\u017fed thcln they.\nMr. Sovthey has also introduced in hif wild bul beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hlm she best loved whllst in existence. But this cannot be fupposed to have resulted from the sinfulnefs af her life, she being paurtrayed throughout the whole of the tale af a c omplete type 0f purityand innooence. The ueraoious Tournofort gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vampyrism, lo which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besjdes a variety of aneodoles, and traditionary norratives illustrativo of it\u017f effects, has put sarth some leorned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a elassical, as well as barbaricln error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on thi\u017f singularly borribIe superstition might be added; though the present may susflce for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mere ly remarking, that though the lerm Vampyre is tbe one in most gcneral acceptation, there are several others synonymous with il, rnade use of in various parts of the world: of Vrouc0locha, Vard0ulacha, Goul, Broueoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendarit upon o London winter, lhere appeared at the various parties of the leoders of the tori a noblemari, more remarkable for his singularjties, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could riot participclte therein. Apparently, the light laughter af the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by cl look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness relgned. Those who felt this sensation af awe, could not explaln whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing up0n the obicct'\u017f face, did riot seem to pcnetrate, arid at one glance to pierce through to tbe inward workings of the heort; 6ut fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray tbat weighed upon the skln it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accu\u017ftomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging tbeir attention. In spile of the deadIy hue of his face, which never gairied a warmer tint, either from the blusb of modesty, or from lhe s trong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were heaulifvl, many of the female hunters after n0toriety attempted to wiri his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term clsfection: Lady Mercer, who had 6een the mockery of euery m0nster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marrlclge, threw herself jn his way, arid did all but put on the dress of cl mouritebank, to attract bi\u017f notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood hefore him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as jf they werc unporceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But lhough tho common adullrefs could nol influence even the guidance of his eyes, lt was not that the female sex was indifferent ta him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virluaus wife and innocent daughter, lhat few knew he ever addressed himsols to females. He had, however, the reputatian of a winning tongve; and whether it was that il even overcame lho d read of his singular character, or that they were moved by hls apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of lhejr sox srom their domestic virlues, as among those who sully it by their vicef.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon cl young gentleman 0f the name of Aubroy: he was an orphan left wilh on only sister in the possession af greal wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alsa to himself by guardians, who thougbt il their dvty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinqvished the more jmportant charge of his mind tolhe care of mercenary subaltcrns, he cultivated more his imaglnation than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeIing 0f honour and candour, which daily ruin\u017f \u017fo mony millinerf' apprentices. He believed all to sympalhise with virtue, and thoughl thot vico was thrawn in by Providence inerely for the pieturefque effeot of tbe scene, as we sec in rornances: he thought that tbo misery af a cottage merely consisted in thc vesting 0f elothes, whi ch wcre af warm, but which were better odapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in flne, that the drcams of poets were the rcalitie\u017f of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon hi\u017f entering into tbe gay circlcs, many mothers surrounded him, striving whlch should describe with least truth their langujshing ar roinping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening counlenanceswhen he approached, and by thcir sparkllng eyes, when he opened his lips, soon Ied him into false notions of his talents and hls merit. Attached os he wcls lo the rornance of his solilary h0vrs, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thot flickered, not from thc preserice of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of plcasing pictures and defcriptions contained ln those uolumes, from whjch he had formed hi\u017f study. Finding, however, some compen\u017fation jn his gratisied vanity, he was aboul lo relinquish his dreams, when the oxtraordinary bejng we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched hjm; and the very impossibllity os forming an idea of the charclcter of a man entirely absorbed in himse1f, who gave few other sig ns of his observation of extemal objects, than the taoit assent ta their existence, irnplied by the avoidance of t heir c0ntact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soari formed this 0biect into the hero os o romance, and delermined to observe the offfpring of hif fancy, rather than the person bcfore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advariced upon his notice, that his prescnce was always recogriised. He gradually loarnt lhat Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found,from the notes of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about ta travel. De sirovs of gaining \u017fome information respecling this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, whicb f0r many generations has boen thought necessory to enablc the y0ung to take some rapid stops in the career as vice tawards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and nol allowing them to appear as if fallen from tho skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or af praise, acoordlng to the degree of skill shewn in carrying tbem on. They con\u017fented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning hif intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to rcceive from him a proposaI to join him. Flattered by such a mark os esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in coinmori with other mon, he gIadly accepted it, and jn a few days they had passed the ciroling wclters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lard Ruthven's cbaracter, and n0w he found, that, tbough many more of his aclion\u017f were exposed to his view, the results osfered different eonclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\u2014tbe idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more tban enougb to relievo theirimmediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtvous, reduced to indigence by lhe mlsfortunes attendarit even upon vi rtue, that he beslowed his alms;\u2014these were sent srom the door with hardly suppressed sneers; hut when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his warits, 6ut to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him lo the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails ouer the retiring bashfulness of the uirtuous indigent.There was one circumstance abouttbe charity of his Lordship, wbich was still more impressed upon his mind:all those upon whom it was bestowed, irieuitably found that there was a curse upon il, for thcy were all either led to the \u017fcaffold, or funk to thc lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey wos surpri2ed at the apparent eagerness with which hi\u017f eompanion sou ght for the centres of all sasbionable vice; there he entered irito alI the spirit of the soro table: he betted, clnd always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was bif antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with whioh he generally watched the socioty around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rosh youthful novice, or the luckless father os a numcrous famjly; then his very wish seemod fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind waf laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the forinerly affluent youth, tarri from the circle he adorned, cursing, ln the solitude of a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him within the reaoh of this fiend; whilst many a fclther sat frantic, amidst the fpeaking looks 0f rnute hungry children, withoul a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to falisfy their present croving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, thc last gilder he had just snatched from theconvulsive grafp of the innocent: tbis mjghl but be the result of a certain degree of knowledgc, which was not, howover, capable of combating the cunning of lhe more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represont this to his friend, and 6eg him to rosign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own prosit;\u2014but hc delayed it\u2014for oach day he haped bis friend would give bim some opportunity of fpeaking frankly and openly to him; howeuer, this never occvrred. Lord Ruthven in his carrlage, and amidst lhe variouf wild andrich scenes of nature, was always thc same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and lh ough Aubroy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitoment of vainly wishjng to break that mystery, which ta his exalted imagination began to assume the appearclnce of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived al Rome, and Aubrey for a timo lost sight of his componion; he left him in daiIy attendarice upon the rnorning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in seorch of the memorials of another almost desertedcity. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived fr0m Eng1and, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sifter, breathing n0thing but affeetion; the others were from his guardlans, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in hif companion, these seemed to gjve him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friond, and urgod, that bis character was dreadfully viciaus, for that the possession of irresi\u017ftible powers of \u017feduction, rendered his lloentious habjts more dangerous to sooiety. It had been disc0vered, that his contemptfor the adultress had not originated in hatred 0f her chclracter; but that he had required, t0 enhance his gratjfication, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to tbe lowest abyss 0f jnfamy and degradation: in fine, that all those semales whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expo\u017fo the whole deformity of their vices to the public gazo.\nAubrey determincd upon leaving one, whose characterhad nol yet shown a sjrigle bright point on whjcb to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext f0r abandoning him altogether, purposing,jn the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumftances pass by unnotlced. He entered into lhe same circle, and soori perceived, thot his Lordship waf endeavouring to work upon the incxperience of thedaughter of the lady whoso house he chiefly freqvented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was tberefore obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Aubrey's eye folIowed him in all his windings, arid soon discovered that ari assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtlcss girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rutbven, and abruptly as ked him his interitions with respect to lhe 1ady, informing him at the same time that he wos aware of his being about to meet her that very riight. Lord Ruthveri answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed alI would hove upon such an accasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely 1aughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writ-\ning a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartmonts, clnd calling upon tbe mother of thc Iady, informed her of all he knew, not only witb regard to her dclughtcr, but also c0ncerning tho character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspician of his pIans having beeri foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixedhis residence in lhe house of a Greek; and soori occupied himself in trocing the faded rocords ofancjcnt glory upon monuments that apparent-\nly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidderi themselves beneath lhe sheltering soil or many colo ured lichen. Under thc same roof os himself, existed a being, so beautiful and dellcate, that she migbt have formed lhe madel for o painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful iri Mabomet's paradiso, save lhat her eyes spoke too much mind for ariy one to think she could belong to those who hcld no soul\u017f. A\u017f she danced upon the plajri, or tripped along tbe mountain'\u017f side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of ber beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparcntly the eye of ariimated nature, for tbat sleepy luxurious look of the aniinal suited but to the taste of ari eplcure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his seareh after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in thc pursuit of a Kclshmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of ber form, floatjng as it were upon tho wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letter\u017f he had just decyphered upon an almost effaoed tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tres\u017fes falling, as she flltted around, exhibit in tbe sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it migbt welI excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escope fr0m his mind lhe very objcct he had before tbought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausonias. But why attempt to describe charms whioh all feel, but none can apprecjate?\u2014It wos innocenee, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling bal1s. Whilst he drew thoso remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and wcltch lhe magjc effects of his pcricil, in trclcing the scenes of her ncltive place; she would then describe to him the clrcling dance upori the open plain, wou1d paint, to bim in all tbe glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered vjewing in her infancy; and then, turnirig to subjects that had evidently made a greclter impression upon her mind, would tell him oll the svpernatural tales of her nurse. Her eornestness and apparent belief of whal sho narrated, excited the jnterost even of Aubrey; and often as \u017fbe told him thc tale of the living vampyre, who had pa\u017fsed years amldst his frlends, and dearest ties, f0rced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fema1e to prolong his existence for the erisuing montbs, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted lo lavgh hor out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe clted to him thenomes of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselvos, after several of their riear rolatives ond children had 6een found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; ond when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to beljeve her, for it had becn, remarked, that those wha had darod to question their existence, always had somo proof given, which obliged them, with grief and beartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detoiled to him the traditional appearance of these monstors, and his borror was iricreasod, by hearing a pretty accurate descriplian of Lord Ruthven; he, howevcr, still persisted iri persuadlng ber, thot thcre eould be no truth in her fears, lh0ugh at the sclme time he woridercd at the mariy coincidenees which had all tended to excite a belicf in lhe supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey hegan to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; hor innocence, so contra\u017fted with all the afsected virtves of thc women among whom he had sought for his vision of romarice, won his hoart; clnd while he ridiculed tbe idecl of a young man of Englifh habilf, marrying ori uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attoched to the almost foiry form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his obiect was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins oround him, whilst in his mind he retained on image that seemed aIone lhe rightful posfessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uneonsciousof his lovo, and was evor the same frank infantile being he had fir\u017ft known. She always seemed to part from him with reluetance; but it was 6ccause fhe had no langer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragmont which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeoled to her parents on the subject of Vclmpyres, and they both, with scveral prosent, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determincd to proceed upon one of hisexcursions, which wos to detcliri him for a few hours; when they heard the riame of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he mvst nooessarily pass through a wood, wherc no Greek would ever remain, after the day had olosed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resorl of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgief, and denounced tho most heavy evjls as impending upon him who dared to cr0sf their path. Aubrey made Iight of their representations, and tried ta laugh them out of the idea; but whon he saw tbem shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, inferrial power, tho very name of whjch apporently mclde their bload freezc, he was silenl.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upori his excursion unattended; he was svrprised to observe the melancboly faco of his hoft, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of thoso horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his harse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these bcings lo be put in aclion;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in hls research, tbat he dld not perceivethat doy-light would soon end, arid that in the horizon there was one of tho\u017fe specks which, in tbe warmer climates, so rapidly gatheririto a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon lhe devoted counlry.\u2014He at last, however, inounted his horse, determiried to make up by speed for his delay: but it wos too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night hegins: and ore he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its eoholng thunders hcld scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heclvy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightnirig soemed to fall and radiale at his very feet. Suddenly hif horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rclpidity tbrough the entangled forest. The animal at lclst, througb satigue, slopped, and he found, by the glclre of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself vp from the masses of dead Ieaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, hc approached, hoping to find some one to gvide him to the town, or at least trusting to ohtoin shelter from the pelting of the stor m. As he clpproached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the droadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open thc door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknoss: the sovnd, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continucd, ond no notice wa\u017f taken of hjm. He found himself in contact with some one, wham he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Againbaffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and ho felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed supcrhuman: determlned to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himsolf vpon him, and knee1ing upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare of many torches penetrclting throvgh the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014ho lnstantly rose, and, lcaving his prey, rushed through the doar, and in a moment the crashing of the bronches, as he broke tbrough the wood, was no longer heard. Tbe storm was now stilI; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; thc light of their torches fell upon the rnud walls, and the thatcb loaded on every indivldual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to percoive the airy form of his fair conduetress brought in a lifeless corse. He \u017fhut his eyes, hoping that it wos but a vision arising from his disturhed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, strctched by his sido. There was no colour upon her cheek, n0t evon upon her lip; yet there was a stillnefs about her face that seemed almost os attaching as the lise that 0nce dwelt lhere:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having operied the vcln:\u2014lo this the men pointed, crying, simultoneously struck wlth horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickIy formed, and Aubreywas laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visionf, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He kncw not what his thoug-\nhts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014heheld olmost vnconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular con\u017ftruction, which had bcen fovnd in the hut. They were soon met by difforent parties who had been engaged in the fearch of her whom a mother had missed. Their 1amcntable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; but wheri they ascertained the couse of their child's deoth, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed wos seized with a most vl olent fever, and was oflen deli rious; inthese inlervals he wovld ca1l upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianlhe\u2014by \u017fome unaccountclble comhination he seemed to beg of his f0rmer companion lo spare the being he 1oved. Atother times he would jmprecate inaledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced atthis time to arrive at Athenf, and, from whatever m0tive, upon hearirig of the state of Aubrey, immodiately placed himself in the same house, and became his eonstant attendant. Wben tho latter recovered fromhis delirium, he was borrified and startled at the sight of him whose irnclge he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kindwords, implying a1most repentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, onxie ty, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presenco. His lord\u017fhip seemed quile changed; he no longer appoared thclt apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescerice began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state os mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was \u017furpri sed to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious oxultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but tbis sm ile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, or in markirig the progress of tbo\u017fe or6s, clrcling, like aur warld, the rnoveless sun;\u2014in-\ndeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes 0f all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, ond tbat elafticity of spirit which had once sa diftinguished bim now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitvde and filence as Lord Ruthven; 6ul much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athenf; is be sought it ainidsl the ruiris he had farmerly frequerited, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in lhe wo0ds, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, iri quesl of the modest violet; theri suddenly turning rourid, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded tbroat, with a meek smile vpon hcr llps. He determined to flyscenes, every feoture os which created such bitter associations in his mind. He propased to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himfelf bound by the tender cclre he had taken os him during his illne\u017fs, that they should uifitthose parts of Greecc noithcr had yet seen. Tbeytravel1ed in evory direction, and sought every spot to which o recolleclion could be altached: but though they thu\u017f hastened from place lo place, yet they seemcd not lo heed what they gazed upon. They heard inuch os robbers, but they gradually began to sligbt these reports, which they imagiried were only the invention of individuals, whose interost it was to excite the generosity af those whom they deferided from pretended dclngers. In consequence of thus neglecting tbe advice ofthe inhabitants, on one occasionthey travollod with only cl few guards, more to serve as guidef than as a defence. Upon entering, howeuer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring preeipices, lhey had roclson to repent their negligence; for scarcely were lhe whole os the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled hy the whistlirig of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed reportof several guns. In an inslant their guards had lestthem, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report come. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sbelteririg turn of the defile: but ashained of being thus detairicd by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advanee, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of tbe robb ers should climb above and lake them in tho rear, they determined at once to rvsh forward in search of tbe enemy. Hardly bad thoy lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Avbrey hastened to his assistance; clnd, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was s00n surprised by seeing the robbers' facef around him\u2014his guards baving, upon Lord Ruthven's being woundcd, immediately thrown up their orms and surrendered.\nBy promises af great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; clndhaving agreod upon a ransom, he was no more disturbcd by their prefence\u2014they boing content merely to guard the entrarice till their comrade should return with the promiscdsurn, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly docreased; in twa days morlificatian ensucd, and dealh seemed odvancing with hasty steps. His eonduct and appeararice had nol changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had beeri os the objects about him: but towards the close of the la\u017ft evenirig, his mind bec ame apparently urieasy, and his eye oft en fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer hif assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may da more lban that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of tbe passing doy; but you rnay save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"H0w? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life eb6s apaee\u2014I cannot explain tbe whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of mo, my hanour were free srom stain iri the world's mouth\u2014and if my deatb were unknown for some time in Erigland\u2014I\u2014I\u20146ul life.\"\u2014\"It sball riot be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" oried the dying man, raisirighimself wlth exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your natvre fears, sweartbat, sor a year and a dcly you will not impart your knowledge of my crjmes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or wbatever you may seo. \"\u2014His eyes seemed hursting from lheir socketf: \"I swea r!\" said Aubrey; he surik laughing upon hjs pillow, and breathed rio more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his aoquointance with this man rose upon hi\u017f mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered bis oath a cold shlvering came over hirn, as if from the presentiment os somelhirig horrible awaiting bim. Ri\u017fing early in the rnorning, be was about to enter lhe hovel in which he had left the corp\u017fe, when o robber met him, and informed him thal it was no loriger there, having been conveyed by him-\nself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mourit, according to a promise they had given his lordship, thal it should be oxposed to the first cold rcly of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and takirig several of the men, determined to go and bvry it upon lhe spot whero it lay. Bvt, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the eorpse 0r the clothes, though thc robbers swore they pointed out lhe identical rock on which they had 1ajd the body. For a tiine his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of tbe clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrihle misfortunes, and in which alI apparently conspired to heighten that svperslitious melanchaly that hcld scized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whilo waiting far a vessel to conuey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupied himself in arranging tbose effects he had with him be1onging to Lord Ruthuen. Amongst otber things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or 1ess adaptcd to onsure the deoth of the victim. There were several doggers arid ataghans. Whilst tvrning thein over, and exarninirig their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornclmented in tbe same slyle as the dagger di\u017fcovered iri the fatal hut\u2014he shudderod\u2014hastenirig to gain furthcr proof, he found the weapon, and hls horror may be imagined wheri be discovered that lt fitted, though peculiarly shoped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wisbed lo disbelieve; hut tbe particular form, the same varying tints upon the hast and shoath were alike in splondour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way h ome, at Rome, his first inquiries wero eoncerning the lady he had attempted lo sriatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parent\u017f were iri distress, thelr forlune ruined, and she had not been beard of since the depclrture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken undor so many repeated horrors; he was afraid tbat this lady hcld faIlen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation corisisted in urging the speed of lhepostilions, as if he were going to save lhe life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Eng1ish sh0ros; and he hastened to the mansiori os his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and coresses of his sisler, all memoryof the post. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affectlan, naw that the waman began to appear, she was still rnore attacbing as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey had not thot winning grace whlch gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There waf none of that light brilliancy which onlyexists in the heated atinosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up hythe levity of the mind beneath. There was a molancholy charm about it which did not scem to arise srom misfortune, bvtfrom some feeling within, thal appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light fo0ting, which strclys where'er a bvtterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate ond pensive. When alone, hcr face was never brightened by the \u017fmile of joy; but when her brother breat hed to her his affeolion, and would in ber presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile sor that os the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyef,\u2014that face were then playing iri the light of thelr owri native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presenled to the worId, it having been thought by her guardians more fil that her presentation should be dolayed until her broth er's return from lhe continent, wben he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the riext drawing-roorn, which was fast approachirig, sbould be the epocb of her entryinto the \"bu\u017fy soene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancho1y which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashianable strarigers, when his mindhad been so torn by the events hc had witnessed; buthe determined to sacrifice his own c0mforl to the pratection of hi\u017f sister. Tbey soon arrived in town, and prepared for the ncxt day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-roam had riot bcen held for a Iong time, and all who were anxious to bask in tbe smile of royalty, hastcned thither. Aubrey was there with hi\u017f sister. While he was standing jn a corrier by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembronce that the flrst time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in thal very place\u2014he fell himself suddenly seized by the arm, arid a voice he recognized too well, sounded in hif ear\u2014\"Reinember your oath.\" He had hard1y courage to turri, fearful of seeirig a spectre thal would blaft him, when he porceived, at a little distance, lhe same figure which had attracted his notlce on lhis spol upon his first entry int0 fociety. He ga2ed till his limbs almost refusing to boar thcir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing o passage through the crowd, ho threw himself into hjs carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room wilh hurried stops, and fixed his harids upon hls heod, as if he werc afraid bis thoughts were bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again besore him\u2014circumstanc es started up in drcadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014Ho roused himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up tho image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that il could be real\u2014he determined, thcrefore, to go again into society; for though hc attempted to ask concerriing Lord Ruthven, tbe name hung upon his lips, arid he eould not succeed in gaining iriformation. He went a few nighls after with his sister lo the assembly of a near relali on. Leaving her under the protecliori of a matron, he retirod into a recess, and thcre gave himscls up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many wero leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found hjs sister \u017furrourided by several, apparcntly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass arid get near her, when one, whom he reqvesled to move, tvrned round, and revealed to him those fealures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, selzed his sistor's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he foundhimself iinpcded by lhe crowd 0f servants wbo were waiting for their l0rds; clnd while he was engagod in passing them, he again heard thal voice whispcr close to him\u2014\"Remomber your oath!\"\u2014He did not darc to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey becamealmost distracted. If before his mind had beon absorbed by one subject, how muoh more completely was it engrossed, now that the certairity of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentians were now unheeded, and jt was in vain that she intreated him t0 explain t0 her what had cclused his abrupt eonduct. Hc only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewi1dered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his brealh, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? Hif very fister might have been touched hy hiin. But even if he were to bre ak his oath, and di\u017fclase his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the wa rld from such a wrelch; but death, he rcmembered, had been alreody mocked. For days he remaincd in tbis ftate; shul up in his room, hc saw no one, ond ate only whon his sister came, who, with eyes streaming wjtb tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, n0 longer capable of bearing stillness and soIitude, be left his house, roamed srom street to streel, anxious to fly thclt image which haun-\nted him. His dres\u017f became neglecled, and he wclndered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to thc midnight damps. He was no longer to be recagnized; at first ho returned with the ovening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever satigue overlook him. His sister, anxlous for his safety, emp1oyed people to foll0w him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any\u2014from thought. His condvct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he lefl by hi\u017f absence the whole af hjs friends, with a fiond amongst them, of whose presence they were unconsclous, he determinod to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxi0us to forewam, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approachcd with intimacy. But wben he enlered irito o room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, tbat his sister wos at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, f0r her sake, a fociety which affected him so strongly. When, h0wever, remonstranoe proved unauailing, the guardians th0ught proper to int-\nerpofe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thougbl it high timc to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of sauing him from lhe inju rics and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of prcventing him from exp0sing to the general eye lhose marks of what they oonsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in lhe house, and take constant care of hiin. He hardly appeared to notice jt, so completely was his mind abs0rbed by one terrible subject. Hi\u017f incoherence became at last so great, that he was confiriedto his charnber. There he wovld often lie for days, incapable of belng roused. He had become emaciated, bis eyes hcld attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only slgn of affection and recollection remainirig displaycd itself upon the entry af his sister; then be would sometlrnes slart, and, seizing her harids, with looks that severely afflictod her, he would desire her nat to touch him. \"Oh, do not toucb him\u2014if your love for me is aught, do riot go near him!\" When, however, she inquirod to whom he refcrred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and ogaln he sank into a stote, whence not even she oould rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, bowever, as the year was passing, his incohererices became less frcquent, and his mind threw off a porlian of its glaom, whilst his guardians observed, that feveral times in the day he would covnt upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had riearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan up0n the melanch0ly circumstance of Avbrey's being in so awful a situatian, when hi\u017f sifter was going next day to be married. Instantly Avbrey's attention was attracted; ho asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of relvrning intellect, of which tbey foared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif waf a young Earl whom he had met with iri society, Aubrey seemed ploased, and astonished thom still more by his expressing bis inlention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his fister. Thoy answered not, but in a sew minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently agaln capable 0f bcing affected by the insluence of her lovely \u017fmile; for he pressed her to bls breast, and kissed hcr c beek, wet with tear\u017f, flowing at the thought os her brother's heing once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warrnth, and to congralvlate her upon her marriage with a person so distingui\u017fhed for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; openirig it, wbat was his surprise at beholding the foatures of the monster who had so long influonced his life. Ho s eizod the portrait in a paroxysm of rclge, ond tr ampled it under soot. Upon her asking hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he lookcd as if be did not uriderstand ber\u2014then sejzing her hands, and gazing an her with a franlic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that sbe would never wed this monfter, sor he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned sudden1y round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but sow no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thovght this wcls but a returri of his disorder, entered, ondf0rclng him srom Miss Aubrey, desired her lo leave him. He fell upon his knoes to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing thif lo lhe infanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacjfy bim, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the rnorning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readiIy vnderstood himself lo be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultalion and pleasure o0uld hardly be coricealed from those among whom he had gained this inf0rmation. He hastened to the house of his former c0mpanion, orid, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brolher and interest ln his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mis\u017f Aubrey. Who couId resist hi\u017f power? Hls t0ngue hod dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded carth, fave with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy os preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing clccents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use lheserpent's art, or such was the will of fate, thot he gained her affections. The title af the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained animportant embassy, whjch served af an excvse sor hastening the marriage, (in spile os her brotber's deronged state,) which was to take place thc very day before hi\u017f departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when be was left by the phy\u017fician arid his guardian\u017f, attempted to 6ribo the servants, but in vain. He asked for peri and paper; it was given him; hewrote a lettcr to his fister, conjuring her, as shevalued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of thase now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as thelr hope and the hope of their house, to de1ay but for a few hours that marriage, ori which he deriovnced the most heavy curses. Tbe servants promised they would deliver it; but giving il to the physician, he thought it betler not to harass any more the mind of Misf Aubrey by, what he considered, thcrauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubroy heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived thari described, the notes of bvsy preparation. Mornlng camc, and the sound os carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew alm0st frantic. The curiosity of tbe servants at last 0vercame theirvigilance, they gradually stole away, loaving him in the custody of an helple\u017fs old woman. He seized the apportvnjty, wlth onebound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately appraached, and, taking his arm by force, hurrjed him from lhe room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered jn his ear\u2014\"Rcmember your oath, and kn0w, if not iny bride to day, y0ur sister is dishonoured. Women are sroil!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atteridants, who, rovsed by the old woman, bad come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, hod broken a blood-vessel, and he was coriveyed to bed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was nol present when he entered,as tho physician wcls afraid of agitating her. The marriage wcls s0lemnized, ond the bride and bridegroom left Landon.\nAubrey's weakness iricreased; the effusion of bload produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight bour had slruok, he relatcd composedly what the reader has peruscd\u2014he died jmmediately after.\nThc guardianf hastened t0 protecl Miss Avbrey; but when they arriuod, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst os a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT 0F A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was al1 besore him, where to choose hls place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grccian Archipelago, on hoard one of his Majesty's uessels, in the yeor 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the is1and of that name. Tbe beauty of lhis place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetabIes always to be had there, lnduce many British vessels to visit it\u2014hoth meri of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of tho track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation os a voyage. We landed; as usual, otthe b0ttom of tbe bay, arid whllst themen werc employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman ond myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Schoo l, and other places, where we had beeri besore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a \u017fmall monticule so riam ed) we met with and engoged a young Greek af our guide, wh0 told us he had comc fram Scio with an Engllshlord, wh0 left the island four days previous t0 our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me af a pilot,\" said theGreek, \"and would bave takeri me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mityl ene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a uery good man. Tho oottage over the hill, facirig the river, 6elongs to him, arid he has left an old mcln in charge of it: he gave Dominick, thewine-trclder, slx hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided lhere about fourtcen montbs, th0ughnot constarit1y; for he sails in his felueca very often to the difserentislands.\"\nThis occourit excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hasteriing to the house where our countryman had rosided. We were kindly received by an old man, who coriducted us over tho mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hclll, a drawing-room, a sitting parlaur, arid a bed-r0orn, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grecn-stained wall\u017f, marble tables on either side, a large myrtlein the centre, and a small fountajn beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by movirig a spring fixed in theside of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed tho furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, clrid an empty bo0k-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single paintjng. The bedchamber had merely a large matt-\nress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pil1ow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed o marble reces\u017f, formerly,the old man told us, filled with hooks arid papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the clofet: it was open, but we did not think ourse1ves justified in examining the contents. On tbe tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokspeare'f, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmormcln, in the Gcrman language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebve'\u017f novels; Schiller'\u017f play of the R0bbers; Mi1ton's Parad ise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; sevoral small pamphlets sr0m the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, hul no English book of any de\u017fcription. Most of these books were fil1ed with marginal notes, written with a pencil, iri Italian and Latin. The Messiclh was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, 0n which also were remarks.\nThe old man soid: \"The lord had becn reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otbers; but,\" said he, \"tbere they must Iie until his return; for ho is so particular, that were I to movo one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week togethcr; be is otherways very good. I orice did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, oxcept twenty zechinof which I pay to an aged Armenlan who resides in a small cottage in lhe wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know sor what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the bouse externally was pleafing. The portico in front was fifty paoes long arid fourteen broad, and the fIuted marble pillars wlth black plinlhs clnd fret-work cornjces, (as it is now cu\u017ftomary in Grecicln arcbitecture,) were considerably higher than tho roof. The roof, surrounded by a ligbt stone balvstrade, was covered bya finc Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of ftrong coarse linen. Most of the house-top\u017f are thus furnished, af upon them the Greeks pass their euenings in smokjng, drjnking light wines, \u017fuch as \"lachryma christi,\" eatjng fruit, and enj0ying the evening breeze.\nOn the loft hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet gllded away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an arnamental woaden back was placed, ori which we were told, the lordpassed many of his evenings clnd nights till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himfels. \"I suppose,\" \u017fajd the old mari, \"prayirig\" for be was very devoul, \"and always attended our cburch twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seot was what may be lermed \"a bird's-eye viow.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eyc lo Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrt1e trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream i\u017fsujng from tho ruin\u017f descended in hroken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a sin gle cloud, terminates tbe view in sront; and a little on the left, through avista af lofty chesnut and palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots os emerald green. I seldomenjoyod a viow m0re than I did t his; but our enquiries were fr ujtless as to the nclme 0f the person who had resided in thls romantic s0litude: nonc know his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenlon,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And oannot you tell, old friond?\" sajd I\u2014\"If I ocln,\" said ho, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visjt the Armenian, but an our returri to the town we learnt several particulars 0f the isolatcd lord. He bad portioned eight young girls whon he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses t0 others, clnd coltan and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bougbt a new boat for a flshermari who had loft his own in a gclle, and he often gave Greek Teslaments to the poor chlldren. In short, he appeared to us, from al1 we collected, to have been a very eecentrio and benev0lent charactcr. One circumstance we learnt, whioh our old friend at the cottage thought pr0per not to disclose. He had a mast beautiful daughter, with whom the lord wos oftenseen walking on the sea-shore, and he hod bought her a piano-forte, and taught hcr himself the use of it.\nSueh wcls the inforrna tion with which we departed fram the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all ori the rack, guessing who this rambler iri Greececould be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthr0py of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived atPalerino, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, tbe architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had beon travelling in Egypt arid Groece, \"Tbe individual,\" said he, \"about wbom you are so anxious, is Lord Byr0n; I met him in my traveIs on the island of Tonedos, and I als0 visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we hadbeen sorne years fr0m home; hut \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognizedthe reoluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not hoving beenmore curious in 0ur researches at tbe cottage, but we consaled ourselve\u017f wjth the idea of returnirig to Milylene on some fulure day; but to me tbal day will never return. I rnake this statement, bolieving it not quite uninteresting, and injustice to hif lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandercd. He has been described as of an unfceling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to so0th its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plclinly gathered from these little anecd0tes. All the finer feelings of the heart, sa elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their soat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide alI his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reafon for marking him as a bejng on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose hcad Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling p roud of him a\u017f a covritryman. With respect to his laves or pleasures, I do not a\u017fsume a right to give an opinion. Reporls are ever to be received with caution, particularly whendirected against man's moral integrity; and he who daref jvstify himself hefore that awsul tribunal whero all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun lhe world's applause, is the surest teslimony of a virtuous hoarl and felf-approving oonfcience.\nTHE END\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-streot.","42":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tole.\nBy JohnWiIliam Po1idori\nTHE fuper\u017ftition upon which this ta1c is fourided is very generol in thc East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did nol, however, extend itself to the Greeks unlil after the estahlishment of Christianity; and it has onIy assumod its present form since the division of lhe Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idoa becoming prevalent, that a Latin body co uldnot corrupt if buried in lheir territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, stilI extant, of the dead risjng from their graves, and feeding upon tbe blood of the young and beautiful. In lhe West it spread, with some sl ight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, clnd Lorraine, where the belief oxisted, that vclmpyres nightly imbibed acertain portion of tbe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strengtb, aridspeedily diod of consurnptions; whilst tbese human blood-suckers fattened\u2014arid their veins beeame distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the bl0od to flow fromall the passages of lheir bodies, and eueri from the very pores of thejr skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, 1732, is a ourious, and, of courfe, credible account os a particular oase of varnpyrism, which is stated to have occurred atMadreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examinatjon of lhe coinmander-in-ehief and magistrales ofthe place, they positively and unanimovsly affirmed, that, about five years before, o certclin Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, tbat, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of theTurkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way torid hjmself of the evil, by eating some ofthe earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himse1f withhis blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becomirig a vampyre himself; sor, about twcn ty or thirty days after his death and burial, rnany persons complained of having been t0rmented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his allacks. To prevent surther rnisohief, the lnhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up tbe body, arid found it (as is supposedto be usual in cosos of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corrvption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, ond ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus oblained, they reforted to the accustomed rcmedy. A stake was drivenentirely through the heart arid body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have cried out a\u017f dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw tho ashes intohif grove. The same measures were adopted with tbe c0rses of thase porsons wbo had previously dicd from vclmpyrism, 1cst thcy should, in their turn, become agenls up0n others who survived them.\nThe universal 6elief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChicf bcliliff.\nThls monstrous rodomontade is hore related, because it seems better adapted to il1ustralo the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishinent afler death, for some heinous crime eoinmitted whilst in existence, that thc decoased is not only doomed ta vampyrise, but c0mpelled to co nfine his jnfornal visilations soIely to tbose beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bovnd by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition alluded lo in tbe \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eorth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Theri ghastly haunt the native place, And suck thc blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wi fe, At midnight drain the stream of lifo; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must fced thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know tho demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cvrsing them, Thy flowers are wilhered on the stein. But one that for thy crime must fal1, The youngest, best 6elovod of all, Shall bles\u017f lhee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap lby hearl in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glossy glance must view Whieh freezes o'er its ljfeless blue; Tben with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of wbich, in life a lock when shorn Affection's sondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne awcly by thee Memoria1 of thine agony! Yet wlth thine own best blood sball drip; Thy gnashing toalh, clnd haggclrd lip; Theri stalking ta thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gou1s ond Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From speclre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beclutisul poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyrc corse of the Arablari maid Oneiza, who is reprcsonted as having retumed from the grave for thc purpo\u017fe of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and lnnocence. The veracious Toumesort gives a lorig account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in bis great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, arid traditionary narratives illustrative af its effects, hcls put forth some Iearned dissertations, tendjng to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singu1arly horrible superstition might be a dded; though the preserit inay suffice for the limits 0f a nate, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though lhe term Vampyrc is lhe onc in mosl gcneral acceptati0n, there are several others syrionymovs with il, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, G0ul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened lhal in lhe midst of the dissipations attend-\nant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties os the leaders 0f the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participatc therein. ApparentIy, the light loughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that ho might by a Iook quell it, and throw fear into thosc breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those wbo felt tbis sonsation of awe, could not exp1ain whence it arose: some atlributed it to the dead grey eyc, which, fixing up0n the object's face, did not \u017feem to penetrate, arid at ono gIance to pierce throvgh to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed uponlhe skin jt could not poss. His peculiarities caused hlm to be invited to everyhouse; oll wished to see him, and those who had been accustomod to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spito of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either fr0m the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though ils farm and outline were beauliful, many of lhe feinale hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, somc marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, wbo had been the mockory os every monster shewn in drawing-ro0ms since her marriage, threw herself in hisway, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in vain:\u2014when she stood bef0re him, though hif eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed cls ifthey were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impuderice was baffled, and she left the ficId. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidarice of hls eyes, it was not that the female sex was indiffercnt ta him: yet such was the apparent cavtion with wh lch he spoke to the uirtuous wifc and inriocent davghter, tbot few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputa tion of a winning tongue; and whether it wa\u017f thot it even overcame the dreod of his singular charaeter, or that they wero moved by his apparent halred of vice, he was as often among tbosc females who form the boast of their sex from their domeftic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, t here came to London a young gentleman of the namc of Aubrey: he wcls an orphan lcft witb ari orily sister in the possesslon of great wealth, by parents wh0 died while he was yet iri childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who tboughl jt their duty moroly to take care of his fortune, wbile they relinquished the inore importarit charge of bis mind to the cclre of mercenary svbaltcrns, he cultivated more his imagina tion than his judgment. He had, bonce, that high romantic feolirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so moriy milliners' apprentices. He believcd clll to fympathise with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown in by Provjdence merely for the picturosque effect of the scene, as we sce in romances: he thought that themisery os a cottage mereIy con sisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as worm, but whlcb were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. Hc thought, in fine, that tho dreams of pocts were the realilies of life. He was handsome, srank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay oircles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least trvth their langujshing or romping fav0urites: the daughlers at lhe same time, hy their brightening countenances whcn he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, wben he opened his lips, soori led him into false notions of his talerits and his merit. Attached a\u017f he wa\u017f to the romance of his \u017folitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tal1ow and wax candles that fllckered, not srom the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion ln real life for any of that congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions c0ntained in those volurnes,from which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, ho was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; clnd the vcry impossibility of forming an idea of the oharacler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, wha gave few other signs os his observation of external objects, than the tacil asfent to their exislenoe,implied bythe avoidance of their oontclcl: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered itf propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed tbis object into tbe hero of a romance, and determined to abserve the offspring of his fclncy, ralher than the person besore hiin. Ho becclme acquainted with him, pald him attentions, and so far odvanced upon his notice, thal his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rulhven'saffairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the nates of prcparation in \u2014 Street, thathe was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informalion respecting this singular charactcr, wbo, til1 now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thal it was tirne for him to perform the tour, whicb f0r many generations has beeri tbought necessory to enable the young to take some rapid sleps in tbe career of vice towards putting themselvesupon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them lo appear as if fallen from tbe skie\u017f, wheneuor scandalous iritrigues are mentioned as the subject\u017f of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying thern on. Thcy c0n\u017fented: and A ubrey immediately mentioning his lritentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, wbo, apparontly, bad nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted lt, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no 0pportunity of studying Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed lo his view, the result\u017f offered different conoIuslons from the apparent motivcs to bis conduct. Hls companion was profuse in his liborality;\u2014tbe idle, the vagabond, and tho beggar, received from hjs hand more lhan enovgh to relieve their immodiate wants. But Av6rey could nol avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reducedto indigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, nat to relieve his wantf, but to allow him ta wallow in his lust, or to sink him ftill deepor jn his iniqujty, he was sent away with rich charity. This wcl\u017f, however, attrjbuted by him to the greater impartunity of tbe uicious, whieh generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness af the virtuous indigent. Therewas one circumstarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upori his mind: all lhose upon whom il was best0wed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the l0west and the most abject misery. At Brvssels and otber towns through which they passed, Auhrey was svrprized at the apparent eagernesf with which his companion sought sor the cen tres of all fashionable vice; there he entered irito all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gclmblod with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even m0ro than he gained; but it was always with the fame unchanging face, with which he generally watohed the saciety around: it was not, however, so whcn he encountered lhe rash youthfulnovice, or thc luckle\u017fs father of a numerous family; theri his very wish seemed fortunc's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with morefire than lhat of the cat whilft dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circlo be adorned, oursing, ln tbe solitude of a dungeori, lhe fate that had drawri hirn within the reach of this fiend; whilst many cl father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith lobuy even sufficienl to satisfy thejr prefent craving. Yet he took no money fram the gambling table; but immediate1y lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gjlder he had just snotched from the convulsive grasp of thc innocenl: this might but be thc result of a certain degreo of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Au6rey aften wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure whieh provcd the rujn of alI, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delclyed it\u2014for eaoh day he hoped his friend would give him some opporturiity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never oocurred. Lord Ruthven in hi\u017f corriage, and amldst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was olways the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey waf riear the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratificotion from il thanthe coristant oxcitement of vainly wishjng to break lhat myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of fomething supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, andAubrey for a time lost sight of his cainpanion; he left hjm in daily attendance up0n the morning circle of on Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of anoth er almost deserted city. Wbilst he was lhus ongaged, letters arrived from England, whjch be opened with eager jmpatierice; tho first was from his sister, breathing nothing bul clffection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonlshed him; if it had before entered into his imaginatiori that there was cln evil power residont in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immedialely leaving his friend, orid urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of lrresistiblc powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangorous lo society. It bad been discovered, that bis conlempt for the adultres\u017f had not origirialed in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratlfication, that hls victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnocle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy ond degradati on: in fine, that all those fernaIos whom he had sought, apparently on accovnt of their virlue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their viccs to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had riot yctshown a single bright poinl an which to rest tbe eye. He resolued to invent some plausible pretext f0r abandoning bim altogether, purposing, in thc inean whi1e, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, arid soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring t0 work upori the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is \u017feldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innacent, though thoughtless girl. Loslng no time, he eritercd the apartment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked biin his intentions with respeet to the lady, informing him at lhe same time that he was aware of his beirig about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthvon answored, that his intentlons were such as ho supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and uponbeing presfed whether he intended ta marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immedjately writing a note, to say, that from that moment be must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of tbeir proposed taur, he ordered hif servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but aIso concernjng the characterof his Lordship. Tbe assigriation was preventod. Lord Ruthven next day merely scnt hisservant to notify his complete asfent to a separation; but djd not hint any suspioion of his plans having becn foiled by Auhrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubreydirected his slepf towards Greeee, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded recordsof ancient glory upon monuments that apporently, ashamed of chronjcling the deedsof freemen only before slaves, had hidden themseluesbeneath the sheltering soiI or many ooloured lichen. Under lhe same roof clshimse1f, existed a being, so beclutifu1 and delicate, that she might hove formed lhe model for a painter w ishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradi\u017fe, savo that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to tbink she could belong to th0se whahad no souls. As shc danced upon the plaln, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have lhought the ga2elle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchariged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariima1 suited bul to the laste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acc0mpanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, ond oflen w0uld the uriconscious gjrl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttersly, show the whole beauty of her form, floclting as it were upori tbe wind, to the eclger gaze of him, who forgot thc lettcrs he had just decypherod upon an alrnost effaced tablet, iri the coritemplation of her sylph-like figurc. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exbibit in the sun's ray such delicately brillianl ond swistly fading huos, itmigbt wel1 excuse the forgetfulness of lhe antjquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretcltion of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It wasinnocenco, youth, arid bcau ty, unaffocted by crowded drawing-roams and stifllng balls. Whilst he drew those remainf of which he wished to preserve a memorial sor his future h0urs, she would stand by, and watoh the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open ploin, wauld paint, to him in all the glowing colaurs of youthful memory, the inarriage poinp she remembered viewjng in ber infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greclter impression upon her mind, would toll him all the supernatural tales of her nur\u017fe. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrclted, excited the interest even of Avbrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst hif frierids, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the lifo of a l ovely female to prolong his exislence for the ensuing monlhs, his hlood would run cold, whilst he attcmpted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasie\u017f; bvt Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living am0ng themselves, after severa1 af their near relatives and children had been faund marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when shc found him so jncrcdulous, shc 6egged af him lo believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared lo question their existence, always had some proof given, which obIiged them, wilh grief and heartbreoking, to confess it was lrue. She detailed to him the traditionol appearance of these monsters, and his horror waf increased, by hearing a pretty accurate descriptian of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in pcrsuading her, thal there could be no truth in her fears, tbougb at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which hod all tended to excite a b elief in the superriaturaI power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach him\u017felf more andmore lo Ianthe; her innocence, s0contrasted with al1 the offected virtucs of the women among wham he had fought for bis vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idca of a yourig man of Engli\u017fh habits, marrying an uneducated Greekgirl, still hesound himself m0re and more ottached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plon for soine antiquarian resoarch, be would depclrt, determined not t0 return until hi\u017f obiect wcls attained; but hc alwaysfound it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruinsaround him, whilst iri his mind he retained on image that scemed alone the rightful possess0r of his thaughts. Ianthe was uneonscious 0f his lovo, arid was ever tbe same frank infontile being he had first known. Sbe always seemed to part from him with reluctance; hut it was because she had no longer any one wllh whom she could uisit her fauourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occvpied in \u017fkelchirig or uncovering s0me fragment whioh had yet escaped the destructjve hand oftime. She had appealed to her parents on tbe subject of Vclmpyres, and they both, with several prosent, affirined their existenoe, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Auhrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, whicb was to detoin him for a few hours; when they heardthe name of the place, they clll at once begged os him not to return at night, as he musl necessarily pass through a wood, whereno Greek would ever remain, after the day had clofed, upon any consideration. Tbey described it as the res0rt of thc vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, anddenovnced the most heavy oviI\u017f as impending upon him who dared lo cross thcir path. Auhrey made light of their representations, ond tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when be saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, thc very riamo of which apparently made their blood freezc, he was silent.\nNext mornirig Aubrey fet off upon his excursion unattonded; bo was surprised to obserue the melancholy saee of his host, and was concerned lo find that his words, mocking thebclief of those horr-\nible fiends, had inspired them witb \u017fvch terror. When he wcl\u017f about to depart, Ianthe came to tho side 0f his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retum, ere night alIowed the power of these beings to be pvt in aetion;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his refearch, that he did not perceive that day-light wauld soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of tho\u017fe specks which, in the warincr climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mclss, clnd pour all their rage upon thedevoled country.\u2014He at last, bowever, mounted bis horse, determinod to make up by speed for his delay: but lt was to0 late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is cllmost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the powor of the storm was aboue\u2014its echoing thuriders had scaree1y an interval of rcst\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way tbrough the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to foll and radiale at his very feet. Svddenly his horse took fright, and he wof carried with dreadful rapidity thr0ugh the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, sto-\npped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovcl that hardly ljfted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping t0 find some one to guide him ta the lown, or at least trusting to o6tain shelter from the pelting ofthe storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the drcadful shrieks 0f a womon mingling wlth the stifled, exultant mackery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startIed: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his hoad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He sound himself in utter dclrkness: thc sound, however, guided him. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds coritinuod, and no notice was taken of him. He found bimsels in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a volce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a l0ud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grapplod by one whose strength soemed superhuman: dotermiried to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hur1ed with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemythrew himse1f upon him, and kneelirig upon his 6reast,had placed hls hands upon his throat\u2014when the gla re of many torches penetrating through the h0le that gavcIight in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, clnd, leaving his prey, rushed thraugh the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, cls ho broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The \u017ft0rm was now stil1; and Aubrey, incapable of inovjng, was soori heard by those without. They entcred; the light of thelr torches fell upon tho mud walls, and lhe thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy f1akef of sool. At the desire 0f Aubrey thcy scarched for her who had attracted himby her cries; be was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches ance more bursl upon him, to perceive the airy form of hi\u017f fair oonductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, haping that it was but a vision arising from hi\u017f di\u017fturbed imagination; but he again sawthe same f0rm, when he unclosed them, slretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan her lip; yet there was a stillness abovt her face thal seemed almost cls attachjng as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon ber neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were tho marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to thls the men pointed, crylng, simultaneously struok with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly farmed, ond Avbrey was laid by the side of her who hod late1y been to him the objeet of so many brigbt and fairy vision\u017f, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014hi\u017f mind was 6enumbed ond seeined lo shun reflection, and toke rofuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his band a nakcd dagger of a partlcular eonftructjon, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of ber whom a molher hod inissed. Thcir lamentablc cries, as thcy approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe tbeir grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child'\u017f doath, they lo oked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They wero iriconsolable; both died broken-bearted.\nAvbrey belng put to bed was seized with a most vlolent fever, and was osten dellrious; in tbefe intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iclnthe\u2014by some unaccouritable combinatjon he seemed to beg of his foriner companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he wouId im precate mclledictions vpon his head, and curse him as hcr destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at tbis time lo arrive at Atheris, and, from whatever motive, upon bearing of the state of Aubroy, immediately placed himself iri the same hovse, andbecame hi\u017f c0n-\nslanl attendant. When the latter recavered from his delirivm, he was horrifled and startlod at the sight of him whose image he had now oombined with thclt of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthveri, by his kind words, impIying almost repenlance for the fault that bad c aused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxioty, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Avbrey; but os soon cls his convalescence bcgan to be rapid, he again gradually retired jnto the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from thc former man, except thal at timcs he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a srnile of malieious exu1tation playing upon bis lips: he knew nat why, but thi\u017f smile haunted him. During thc last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appa-\nrently erigaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coo-\nling breeze, or in marking tho pr0gress of those orbs, circling, like our worId, the movcless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to auoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakoned, and that elasticity of spiritwhjch had once so distinguished hiin naw seemed to have fled for ever. Ho was now as muoh a lover of solitudo and silence a\u017f Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solilude, his mjnd could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sougbt it amidst the ruins hc had formerly frequented, Ianthe'f form stood by his side\u2014if he saught it in the woods, her light step would appear wondering amldst the underwood, jn quest 0f the modesl violet; then suddenly turning rovrid, would show, to his wild imaginalion, hcr pale face ondwounded tbroat, wltb a meek smile upon her li ps. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitler associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsclf bound by the tender care he had laken of him during his illness, that they sbould visit those parts of Greece neither hod yet seon. They travelled in euery djrection, and sought every spot to whicb a recollectian could be atlached: but though they thus ho\u017ftonedfrom place to place, yet they seemed ri0t to beed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually hegon to slight these reports, which they imagincd were orily the invention of individuals, whose intcrest it was to excite tbe generosity of those whom they defended from protended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting thc cldvice of the inhabitants, on one occaslori they travelled witb only a few guards, more to serve cls guides than as a defenc e. Upan enterlng, howcver, a narrow defile, ot the boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rack brought down from the neighbouring precipioes, they had reasori to repent thcir negligence; for scarcely wore the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the ec hoed report of several guns. In an in\u017ftant their guards had left lhem, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had 6ogun to sire in the direclion whence the repart came. LordRuthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of thedefile: but ashamed os beirig thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advarice, and bejng exposed lo unrcsisting slaughter, if any of tbe robbers shouId cljmb above and tako them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost tbe shelter 0f the rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in thc shoulder, which brought bim to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heoding the contest or hif own peril, was soon surprisedby seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven'f 6eing wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrcnderod.\nBy promises of great rewclrd, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend ta a neighbauring cabin; and baving agreed upon a rclrisom, he was n0 more disturhed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade shovld return wlth the promjsed fum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidlydecreased; iri two days martification ensued, and death seemed cldvancing wilh hos ty steps. Hjs conduct and appearance had not chclnged; he seemed as unconscious of pain as ho had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, hls inind bocame apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his as\u017fjstance with more than usual earriestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save mc\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mecln not my life, I heed the death of rny exlstence as litlle as that of the passing day; but you may save my bonour, your fricnd's bonour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I wovld doany thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but ljttle\u2014my life ebb\u017f opace\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain jn lhe world's mouth\u2014and if my death were unknown far some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not bc known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dylng man, raising hirnself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your noture fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimcs ar death to any living being in anyway, whatever may hap-\npen, or wbatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes feemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" soid Aubrey; he sunk Iaughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rellred t0 rest, but did not sleop; the many circumstances attonding hif acquaintance with thif rnan rose upon his mind, and he know nat why; wheri be remembered his oatb a co1d shiveririg came over him, as if srom the presentiment of samething horrible awaiting bim. Risjng early jn lhe m0rning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he hadleft the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him tbot il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himsels and comrcldes, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of cl neighbouring mount, according to a promlse they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the firsl cold ray of the moon that roso after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and taking several of the men, determincd to go and bury it upon the spot wbcre it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, lhough the robbers sware they pointed out the ideritical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time hif mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced thclt they had buried the corpse forthe sake of the c1othes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently consplred to heighten that superslitious melancholy that hadseized upori his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soan arrivod at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to oonvey him to Otranto, or t0 Naples, be oceupied himself in arranging tbofe effecls he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhven. Amongst olher things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, morc or 1ess adapted to ensure thedoath of the victlm. There were several daggers and ataghons. Whilst tvrning thoin over, and examining their curiovs forms, whot was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found tbe weapon, and his horror may be irnaglned wheri he discovered that it fitted, though pcculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no surther certainly\u2014they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieue; but the particular form, tbe fame varying tints upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way hame, at Roine, hls first jnquiries were concerning the lady he had attemptod to sriatch from Lord Ruthvon's seductjve arts. Her parents were in distress, thejr fortune ruined, ond she had not been heard of since the departure of his l0rdship. Aubrey's mind became alinost 6roken undor so many repeated horrors; he was clfraid that this Icldy had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He beca me inor0se and silent; and his only occupclljon consisted in urging the speed of the pos tilions, as if he wcre going to save the life of some one he held dcar. He arrived at Calais; a brecze, which seemed obediont l0 his will, soon wafted bjm ta the En glish shores; and he hastened to the mansion 0f his fathers, and lhere, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embroces and caresses of his sister, a1l memory of the past.If she before, by her infantine caresscs, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as o companion.\nMiss Auhrey had not lbat winning graoe which gains the goze and applause os the drawing-rooin assemblies. There was nane of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneatb. There was a melancholy charm ab0ut it which did nol seem lo arise from misfortune, bvt fr0m some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was n0t that light footing, whioh stra ys where'er a butterfly ar a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and penfive. When alone,her faee was never brightened by the sinlle ofjoy; but when her brother breathod to her his affecti 0n, and would in her presence forget those griess she knew destroyed his rest, who w0uld have exchanged her smile for thal of lhe uolupluary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face wore then playing in the light of lheir awn native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nol been presented to the world, it having been thought by herguordianf more fit that her presentation should be delayed until hor brother's return from the continent, whon he might be her protectar. It wasnow, thercfore, r esolved that the next drawing-room, which was fost approachlng, should be the epoch of her enlry irito the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have rcmained in tbe mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could riot feel intorest about the frivolities of fashionablc strangers, when his mind had been sa lorn by the events he had witnessed; bvt ho determiried to sacrifice bis own comfort to lhe protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-roorn.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxlous to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilc he was standirig in a co rner by him\u017felf, heedless of all araund him, engagod in tbe remembrance that tho first tjme he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a uoice he recognized loo well, sourided in bis ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, searful of seejng a \u017fpectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a ljttle distance, the same figure whioh hod attracted his nolice on this spot upon bis first entry into sociely. He gazed till his limbs almostrefusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a sriend, and forclng a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven bome. He paced lho room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he werc afraid his thoughts wero bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circvmstances started up in dreadful array\u2014thc dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could riot believe it posfible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he determjned, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his Iips, and he covld not succeed in gaining information. He wenl a few nig hts after with his sister to thc assemb1y of a near relation. Leaving hor under the protoction of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own de vovring thougbts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and enlering another room, fourid his sls ter surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, ondreucaled to him those features he most abhorred. Hc sprang forward, sejzed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forccd her towards the streel: at the door hc found himself impeded by the cr0wd of servants who were waiting for tbcir lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again beard that voice whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turri, but, hurrying his sister, soan reached home.\nAubrey became alinost dislrocted. If hefore his mind had been absorbed by one subject, haw much more completely was jt engrossed, now that tbe certainty of thc monster'slivirig agairi pressed upon his thoughts. His slster's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupl conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrjfied her. Tbe more he thought, the rnore he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to al low thi\u017f monster to roa m, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have becn touched by him. Bvl oven if he werc to break his oath, ond djsclo\u017fe his suspicions, who wou1d believe him?He thought of employing hisown hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been alreadymocked. F0r days he remained in this state; shut up in hls roarn, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tearf, besaught him, for her sake, to support nature. At 1ast, rio longer capab1e of boaring stillness and solilude, he lefthis house, roamed frorn street to stroet, anxious to fly that image wbiob haunted him. His dres\u017f became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with lhe evening to tho house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever satigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for hif sasety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly cbariged. Struck with the idea lhat he left by hif absenoe the whole of his fricnds, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscjous, he determined to enter clgain into sociely, and watch him closoly, anxious to forewarn, in spjte of his oath, alI whom L0rd Rulhven approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and sufpicious looks were s0 slriking, his inword shudderjngs so visible, that his sister wcls at last obliged to beg 0f him lo abstain from seeking, for her sakc, a society which affecled him so strongly. When, however, remonstrancc proved unavailing, the guardianf tbovght properto interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they tbought it bigb time to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wclnderings, clnd of preventing him from exposlng to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, thoy engaged a physician to reside iri the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence becamc at last so great, that he was canfined to his chamber. There he would ofteri lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had 6ocome cmaciated, his oyes had attoined a glassy lustre;\u2014thc only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed ilself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometjmes start, and, seizing her hands, with lo0ks thclt sevorely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do n0t t0uch him\u2014is your love sor me lf aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, hif only answer was, \"True! lrue!\" and again he sank into cl state, whence n0t even fho could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pasfing, his incoherences became less frequent, arid his mind lhrew off a p0rlion of its gloom, whilst his guclrdians observed, lhat several times in the day be would count upon his fingers a definile numbcr, and thensmile.\nTbe time had nearly elclpsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entorjng his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, whon his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attrocted; he asked anxiovsly ta whom. Glad of this mark osreturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they meritioned the name of tbe Earl of Marsden. Thinking this waf a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrcy seemed pleased, and astonished tbem still more by his cxpressing his intention to be present at the nuptial\u017f, and desiring lo see his sister. They answered not, but in a few mi nutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the insluence of hor lovely smilc; for he pres\u017fed her to hjf breast, and kissed her cheek, wel with tears, flowing clt tho thought of her brother's boing once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all hif wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marrjage with a persan so distingujshed for rank and every accomplishmerit; when he suddenly perceiued a locket upon her breast; opening it, wbat waf bis surprise at behoIdingthe features of the manster who had so long influenced his life. He seized tbe p0rtrait in o paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed lhc reseinblance os her futvre husband, helooked as if he did not understand her\u2014then sojzing her hands, and gazing on her wilh a frantic expressjon of c0untenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monfter, for he\u2014 But he could not advanco\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oatb\u2014he tvrned sudderily rovnd, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meanlime the guardians and physic ian, who had hoard the whale, arid lhought thjs was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, deslred her to leave hirn. He fell upon bis knees to thom, he implored, he hegged 0f them t0 delay but for one day. They, attributing this to thein\u017fanity they imaginod had takcn posse\u017fsian of his inind, endeauoured to paclfy him, and rctired.\nLord Rutbven had called themorning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every orie else. Whcn hc heard of Aubrey's jll health, be readily understood hjmfelf to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultati0n and pleasure could hardly be coricealed from lhose among whom he had gainedthis information. He hastened to thc house os his formor eompanion, and, by c0nstant attendonce, and the pretence of great affection for lhe brother and intcrest iri his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wba could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tolls to recount\u2014couId speak of himself as of an individual having rio sympathy with any being on theerowded earth, save with her to whom be addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem w0rthy of preservation, if it were mercly that hc might listen ta ber soothing accerits;\u2014in fine, he knew so we1l how to use the serpent's art, or such was tbo will of fote, that he gained her affectians. The titlc of the elder branch falling at lenglh to him, he obtained an importont embassy, which served as an cxcuse forhastoning the marriage, (in spite of her brolher's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for tho continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and pclper; it was gjven hlm; he wr0te o letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and tbe hon0ur of th0se now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope arid the hope of their house, to delay but sor a few h ours that marriage, on which he denounced the m0st heavy curses. The servanls promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he tbought it better riot t0 harass any more lhe mlnd os Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to lhe bufy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, wilh a horror that may more easily bc concoived than described, tbe notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sovnd of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Thc curiosity 0f the servclnts al last overcame thoir vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tho custody of an helploss old woman. He seized the opportvnity, with one bound was out of the room, arid in a rnoment found himself in the apartm ent whero all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was lhe first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the roorn, speechless with rage. Wben on thestaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, clnd know, if not my brideto day, your sister is disbonovred. Woinen are fraiI!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendclnts, wha, roused by the old woman, had come jn search os hjm. Aubrey could na longer support himself; his rage notfinding vent, had br0kena 6lood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was nat mentioned to his \u017fister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afrald of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bridc and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion ofblood produced symptoms 0f the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and wben the inidnight hour had struck, he relatod comp0fedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardlans hastenod to protect Miss Aubroy; but when they arrive d, it wo\u017f too late. Lord Ruthven hcld disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND DF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tho world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence hi\u017f guide.\"\nIN Sailing through thc Grecjan Archipelago, 0n board orie of his Majesty's uessels, in lhe year 1812, we put inlo the harbour of MityIene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cottle and vegetables always t0 be had there, induce many Britifh vessels to visit it\u2014both men of war and mercbantmen; and though it lies rather out of thetrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amp1y repoy for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst lhc men were employed in watering, and the pur\u017fer bclrgainirig for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave c alled Homer's Sch0ol, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mourit Ida (a small m0nticule so named) we met wilh and cngaged a young Greek as 0ur guide, who told us he bad come frarn Sci0 with an English l0rd, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and would have takenme with him; but I did riot choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He wcls an odd, 6ut a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left ari old man in charge of il: he gaue Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English curreney,) and has resided there about fourteen months, thovgh not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islarids.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in bastening to thc house where aur countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over thc mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawlng-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-ro0m, with a spaeious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marblo tables on eitber side, a large myrtle in tbe centre, and a smaIl fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe side of a \u017fmall bronze Venus in a loanjng posture; a large couch or sofa completed the fvmjture. In the hall stood half a dozen Eriglish eane chairs, and an emply book-casc: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. The bedchamber had mereIy a large mattress spread on thefloor, witb two stuffed c0tton quilts and a pillow\u2014the cammon bod thraughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the o1d man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not lhink ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rous\u017feau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schil1er's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Itcllian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; severaI small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplo, much lorn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbIed all over, and marked witb sllps of poper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reclding these b0oks the evenlng besore he saiIed, and forgot to place them with tbo others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie untiI his rcturn; for he is so porticular, that were I to move one thirig without orders, he would frown upon me for a week togcther; he is otherways uery good. I onee did him a service; and I bave the produce of this farm far the trouble of taking care of it,except twenly zechines which I pay to an aged Armeniari wh0 resides in a \u017fmall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here srom Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearancc of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces lorig and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and frel-work c0rnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian archilecture,) were considerably higher lhan the roof. The roof, surraundcd by a light stone balv\u017ftrade, was covered 6y a fine Turkey carpel, beneath an awning of strongcoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus surriished, cls upon them the Greeks pass their ovcnings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjoyingthe everiing breeze.\nOn the left hand os we cnlered the house, a small streclmlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes werc clustering togethor on itf borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bu\u017fhes, a marhle seat with an ornclmental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord pas\u017fed many of his evenings and nighls til1 twelve o'clock, reading, writing, arid talking to hiinself. \"I suppose,\" said the old mon, \"praying\" for he was uery devout, \"and aIways attended our church twice cl week, beside\u017f Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was wbat may be termed \"a bird's-eye viow.\" A line of rich vineyard\u017f led the eye to Mount Colcla, covered with oIive and myrtle trees in bl0om, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestlo decay. A smal1 stream issuing from the ruiris descended in broken cascades, unlil it was lost in the woods ncar the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an hori2on unshad0wed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesriut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinclly observed, studding the Iight blue wave with spots of em erald green. I seldom enjoyed a uiew more than I dld this; but our enquiries were fruitles\u017f cls lo the name of the person who hcld resided iri this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick,his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, 6ut I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cann0t you tell, oId friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenjan, but on aur return to lhe lown we learnt scveroI partieulars of the isolated l0rd. He had portioned eight young glrls wheri he was 1ast upon the island, and even danced with thein at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horsesto others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articlcs. He also bought a ncw b0at for a fisberman wha had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to tbe poor children. In short, heappeared lo us, from all we collected, to hclve been a very eecenlric and benev0lent charaoter. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend ot the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beauliful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-sh0re, and he hadbought her a piano-forte, and taught her himsels the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed srom the peacefu1 isle of Mityleno; our imagiriatioris all on the rack, gvesfing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money il was evident: he had philarithropy of disposition, ond all those eccentric ities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dlspelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architecl, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individuaI,\" sold he, \"ahout whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I methjm in my travels on tbe lsland of Tenedos, clnd I also vifited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of hjs lordsbip's fame, as we hadbeen some years from home; bul \"Childe Horolde\" being put into our hands we recognizod lhe reclufe of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researcbes at the cotlage, but we eonsoled ourselves with lho idea of returning to Mitylene on same futureday; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing il not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, whi ch has been grossly slandered. He has bcen described as ofan unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with hvman ncllure, or contributing in any wcly to sooth its sorrowf, or add to its pleasures. The fact ls directly lhe reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these litt1e clriecdotes. All the finer feelings of tbe heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tcnderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of s0litude is an additional reasonfor marking him as a beingon whose heart Roliglon halh set her seal, and aver whose bead Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the precedjng pleasirig \"trajts\" without feeling proud of him os a couritryman. With re\u017fpect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever t0 be roceived with cautiori, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsclf befare that awful tribunal whero all must appear, alone may censure the error\u017f of cl fellow-mortaI. Lord Byron's chclracter is worthy of his genivs. To do good in secrot, and shun the world'f applause, ls the surest testimony of a virtuous heclrt and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prlnter, Crown-court, Fleet-strcet.","43":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wil1iain Polidori\nTHE superstiti0n upon which this tale is founded if very general iri the East. Among the Arabians it appea r\u017f to be commori: jt did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks unlil after the cstablishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latiri and Greek churches; at wbich time, the idea becoming prevalent, that cl Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the \u017fubject of many wonderful stories, stil1 extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the yovrig and beautifu1. In the West jt spread, with some sligbt variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the beIief existed, that vampyres night1y imbibed a certain porlion of tbe blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost tbeir strength, arid speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattencd\u2014and their veins becamo distended to such a state of repletiori, as to cause the blood to flow from al1 the passages of thelr bodies, and even from the very pores os their skins.\nIri the London Journal, of Mareh, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accovnt of a particular case os vampyrism, which is staled to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, tbat upon an examination of tbe commander-in-chief and magistrates of tbe place, lhey positlvely ond unarilmously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nclmed Arnold Poul, had 6oen heard to say, that, at Cassovla, on the frontiers of the Turkish Seruia,he had been tormerited by a varnpyre, but had found a way lo rid himself of the cuil, by eatirig some of the eartb out of the vampyre's grave, ond rubbing himself with his blood. This preoaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hirnself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his declth and burial, many persons complained of having hoen tormented by him, and adeposllion was made, that sour persons hcld been deprivod of 1ife by his attacks. To preverit further mischief, the inhabitarits hauing consvlted their Hadagni, to0k up the body, and found jt (as is supposod to be usval in cases ofvampyrism) fresh, and entirely frec frorn corruption, and emitting at lhe mouth, nose, arid ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof havirig been thus abtclined, lhey resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the hearl and body of Arnold Pclul, at which he is reportod to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alivc. This done, they cut off his head, burncd his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same meas ures were adopted with the oorses of those persons who had previovsly died from vampyrism, lest they should, iri lheir turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre bocomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomoritade is here related, because it seems better odapted lo i1lvstrate the subject of the present observa-\ntions than any ot her instarice which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is corisidered as a sort of punishinent after death, for same heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyriso, but compelled to consine his infernal visitolions soIely lo tho\u017fe beings he loved most wbile vpon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\u2014A supposition allvded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vclmpyro sent,Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck lhe blo0d of all thy racc; There from thy daughter, fister, wifo, At midnight drain the streain of life; Yet loclthe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, ShalI know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, ShalI bless lhee with a father's riame\u2014 That w0rd shall wrap thy hcart in flame! Yet thou muft end thy task and mark Her cheek's 1aft tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And tbe last glassy glanee must view Which free zeso'er its lifeles\u017f blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in llfe a lack wben shornAffection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But n0w is borne oway by thec Memorial of thine clgony! Yol with thine own best 6l0od shall drip; Tby gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sul1en grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afritsrave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed thon they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poein of \"Thalaba,\" tbe vampyre corse os lhe Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormentirig hlm she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be sup posed to have resulted from the sinfu1nefs of her life, she beingpourtrayed throughovt the whole of the tale as a complete type os purity and innocence. The vorclcious Tovrnefort gives a long account in his lravels of severol astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitries\u017f; and Calmet, iri his great work vpon thif fubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionary norratives lllustrative of ils effects, has put farth \u017fome learncd dissertations, teriding to prove it t0 be a cla ssical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices ori this singularly horrible superstition might be odded; th0ugh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoled to explanatjon, arid which may now be concluded by inerely remarkjng, that though the term Vampyre i\u017f the one in most general acceptation, there are several athers synonymous wjth it, made use af iri various parts of the world: as Vrovcolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Br0ucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeried tbat in tbe midst of the dis\u017fipations altendant upon a L0ndon wlnter, there appeared at the uariouf porties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, moreremarkab1e for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed vpon the mirlh around him, as if he couId nol participate therein. Appclrently, the Iight laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by cl look quell it, and throw fear jnto thoso breasts where lhoughtlessness rcigned. Those who felt this sensation of clwe, could not explain whence it arose: some atlributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the objeet's face, did not seem to penelrate, and at one glance t0 pierce through to the iriward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon tbe skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be lnviled to every house; all wisbed to see him, and those who hod beeri accustomed to violerit ex citement, and now foIt the woight of ennui,were pleased at having somethlng in their presence capable of engaging lheir attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whlch neuer gained a warmer tint, either srom the b1ush of modesty, or from tbe strong einolion of passion, though its sorin and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters aftor notoriety attempted to win his ottentians, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had boen the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sineo her marriage, threw herfelf in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though jn vain:\u2014wheri she stoad before him, tbough his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it \u017feemed as if thoy were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the fie1d. But t hough the cominon adultress could not influence even tbe gvidance of his eyes, it wasnot tbat the female sex was indifferent to hiin: yot such was the apparenl cauti0n with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himsclf to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it waf that it even ovorcame the dread af his singular character, or that they were moved by his appa rent hatred of vice, he was as often among those femalef who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as clmong those wha sully jt by their vices.\nAbout the same time, thero came to London a young gentleman of the name 0f Aubrey: he wos an orphcln 1eft wilh an only sister in the possession os great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in chiIdbood. Left a1so to himself by guardians, who thought lt their duty merely to take care of his fortune, whi1e they relinquished the more important charge os his mindlo the care of mcrcenary subaltorns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, tbat high romanticfeeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many mi1liners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown iri by Providerice merely for the picturesque effecl of lhe scene, as we soe in romanoes: he thougbt that the misery of o cottage merely consistcd in the vesting of clothes, wbich were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by t heir irregular folds and various col0urcd patches. He thougbt, in fino, that the dreams of poets were the reallties of life. He wcls handsome,frank, and rich: for these reasons, upori his entering into the gay circle\u017f, rnany mathers surraunded hirn, striuing whioh sbould descri6e wilh lea st truth tbeir languishing or roinping fauovrites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening eountenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened hls llps, soon led him into false notions af his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, be was startled at findl ng, that, except iri the tallow and wax candles tbat flickered, not from the presence of a ghosl, but from warit of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life f0r any of that congeries of pleasing picturcs and deseripti0ns coritained jn those volumes, from which he had formed hls study. Finding, however, some compensation jn his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreclms, whon the extraordinary being we have above defcribed, crossed him iri his career.\nHe watched him; and the uery impossibility of forming an idecl of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observatjon of external objects, than the tacit clssent to their existence, impljed by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattercd it\u017f propensity to cxtravagant ideas, he \u017foonformed this object inlo the bero of a romclnce, and determined to observe the offspring os his fancy, rather than the person before him. He beeame acquainled with him, paid him attentlons, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveri's affairf were einbarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparatlon in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desjrous af gaining some inforination respectlng this singvlar character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hlnted to his guardians, thclt it was time for him to persorm the tour, whlch for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the cclroer of vice lowards putting thcmsolves upon an equclljty witb the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallcn frorn the skies, whenever fcandalous intrigues are mentioned as the svbjects of pleasclntry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. Thoy consented: and Aubrey iminediately mentioning his intentionf to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mork of esteem from him, who, apparently, bad nothing iri common with other men, be gl adly accepted it, and jn a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, lhat, thougb many more of his acti0ns were exposed to hls view, the results offered different conclusions from lhe apparent motives t0 his conduct. His componion was pr0fuse in his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagclbond, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough to rel-\nieve their immediate wants. Bul Auhrey could not auoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reducedto indigence by the misfortunes attendclnt euen upon vlrtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask \u017fomething, not to relieue his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sinkhim still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away witb rich charity. This wcls, bowever, altributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, whi ch gcnerally prevai1s over the retiring boshfulness of the virluous indigent. Tbere was one circumstance about the cbclrity of his Lordsbip, which was still more impressed up0n his inirid: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that lhere was a curse upon it, for lhey were all either led to the soaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the rnost abject mifery. At Brussels and other lowris througb which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness wjth which his companion sought for the centres of all fasbionable vice; there he ont-\nered inlo all the spirit of the faro tahle: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his clnlagonist, and then he lost evon more than he gained; butit was always with the faine unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered lhe rash you-\ntbful novice, or the luckless father af a numerouf family; then hif uery wish secmed fortune's law\u2014this clpparent abstrclctedness of mind was laid aside, ond his oyes sparkled with more fjre than that of the cat whilst dallying with tho half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former1y affluent youth, torn from the cjrcle he adorned, cursing, in lhc solitude of a dungeon, the fatc tbat had drawn him withinthe reacb of this flend; wbilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute h ungry chiIdren, with0ut a single farthing af his late jmmense wealtb, wherewith to buy even suffioient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he look no money from the gambling tahle; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: tbis might but be the result of a eertain degroe of knowledgc, which was not, however, capabIe of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey oflen wished to represont this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure whjch proved lho ruin of all, clnd did not tend lo his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each dcly he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speclking frankly and openly to him; however, lbis never ocourred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidsl lhe var ious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyo spoke less than his Iip; and though Aubrey was near thc object os his curioslty, he obtained no greater gratification from it thcln the constant excitemenl of vainly wishing to break that myftery, which to his exalted imaginatlon began to assume tbe appearance of \u017fomething supernatural.\nThey soon orrived at Rome, and Aubroy for a time lost sighl of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upori the morning cjrcle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in searob of tbe memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arriued fram England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing bvt affectlan; the athers were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imaginalion that there was an evil power resjdent in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon hls immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that hi\u017f charclcter was dreadsully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits mare dangerous to socicty. It had been diseovered, lhat his contempt for the adultress had not originatod in hatred of her character; but lbat he had required, to enhclnce bis gratification, that his uictim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that a1l those females whom he had sought, apparently 0n account of tbeir virtue, had, since his departure, throwri even the mask aside, and had not scrup-\nled to expose the wholc deformity of their viccs to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leavi ng one, whose character had not yet fhown a single bright point on which to rest thc eye. Hc re\u017folved to invent some plavsib1e pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in lhe mean whilc, to watoh him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass 6y unnoljced. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived,that his Lord\u017fhip was endeavouring to work upon lhe inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarricd fema1e is met with in society; he wos lherefore ohliged to carry on his planf in secret; hut Aubrey's eye follawed him in all his windings, and \u017foon discovered that ari assignation had been app0inted, which would rnost likely ond in the ruin of an innocent, though thought1ess girl. Losing no time, he entercd the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentionf with respect t0 the lady, informing him at the same timc that he was aware of his being about to meel her tbat very night. Lord Ruthven anfwored, that his intentioris were sucb cls he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whelher he iritended to marry her, merely lavghed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a not e, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanyirig his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed lour, he ordered bis servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother os tbe lady, inforined her af all he knew, not only with regclrd to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. L0rd Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complele assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion os his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposjtion.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey di rected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, foon faund himself clt Athens. He theri fixed his residence in thc house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient gIory upon m0numents that apparently, ashamed of chronicljng the deeds of freoineri only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many e0loured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, lhclt she might have formed the m odel far a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope af tbe fclithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could helorig to those who had no souls. As she danced upon theplain, or tripped along the mountain'\u017f side, orie would have thought the gazelle a p0or type of her beauties; for wbo would have exchclnged her oye, apparently the eye of animated nalure, for tbot sleepy luxurious 1ook of the animal suited 6ut to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrcy in his search after anliquities, and aften would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, fIoating as it were upon the wind, to the eager goze of him, who forg0t the letters he had ju\u017ft dccyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the eontemplation of her sylph-like figvre.Often would her tresses falling, af she flitted around, exhibit in lhe svn's rcly such dclicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, il might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape frorn his mind thc uery objecl he had before thought of vital importonce to the proper interpretation of a pa\u017fsage in Pclusanias. But why attempt to defcribe charms whieh all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It wcls innocence, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms clnd stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished lo preserve a memorjal for his future hours, shc would stand by, and watch the rnagjc effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of ber native place; she would then describe to hjm the circling dance upon the opon plain, would paint, lo him in all the glowing eolour\u017f of youthful memory, thc marriage p0mp she remembered vicwing in her infancy; and then, turning lo subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon ber mind, would tell bim aIl the supernatural tclles of ber nurse. Her earnestness andapparcnt belief of what she narrated, excitcd the lnterest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of thc living vainpyre, who had pas\u017fed years amidst his friends, and deareft tie\u017f, forced everyyeor, by feeding upon the life os a lovely female to prolong his exislence sor the erisuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of sucb idle and borrible santasies; but Ianthe cited to him the naines of old men, who hod at last detected one living among themselves, aftcr severol of their near relatiues and children had bcen found marked with the stamp of the flend's appetite; arid wheri \u017fhe found bim so incredulous, she 6egged of him to believe her, for it had been, rernarked, tbat thase who had dared ta qvcstion their existence, always had some proof given, whjch obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, t0 confess it was truo. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, ond his horror was iricreased, by hcaring a pretty acovrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, bowever, stiIl persisted in persuading her, that thero cou1d be no truth in her fears, though at the sarne time he wondered at the rnany coincidences wbich had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of L0rd Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her jnnocence, so contrasled with aIl lhe offeoted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his uision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an unedueated Greek girl, still he found bimself more and more attacbed to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear bimselsat times from her, and, sorming a plari far some antiquarjan rescarch, ho wauld depart, dotermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found il impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilsl iri his mind he retained an image thot seemed alone the righlfvl possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uncon\u017fciaus af his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first knawn. She cllways seemod to part from him with reluclance; but it was hecavse sbe had no longer any one with wbom shc could visit her favourite haunts, whllst her guardian was occupied in \u017fketehirig or uncovering some fragment which had yet oscaped the destructlve hclnd os lime. She had appealed to her parents on the suhjeot of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed tbeir exi\u017ftence, pale with horr0r at the very name. Soon clftor, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of hjs excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, thcy all at once beggod of him not la return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, whero no Greek would ever rernain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as lhe resort of tbe vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as imperiding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrcy made 1ight of thejr representatlons, and t ried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder al his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very nome 0f which apparenlly made lheir blood freezc, be was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised ta observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that bis words, moeking the belief of those horrible fierids, hcld inspired them with such terror. Whon he wcls about lo depclrt, Ianthe came to the side of his horfe, and earnestly bogged of him to retvrn, ere night ollowed the power of theso beings to be put in action;\u2014hc promised. He was, however, so occupied in his researeh, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of thase spock\u017f which, in the warmer climatcs, sa rapidly gather irito a tromendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He al last, however, mounted his horse, determjned to make vp by speed for his delay: but it wcls too late. Twilight, in lhese southern climates, is almost unknown; immedialely the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, lhe p0wer of the storm was above\u2014lls echoing thunders had scarcely an lnterval of rest\u2014its thick heauy rain forced its way through the canopyjng foliage, whilst the blue forked lighlning seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through lhe entclngled forest. The onimal at last, through fatigue, stoppcd, and he found, by the glare os lightning, thot he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of decld leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping ta fjnd some one to guide him to the town, or at least lrusting to obtajn shelter from the pelting of the storm. A\u017f he approached, the thunderf, for a moment silent, allowed him to hoar the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the slifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uribroken s0und;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thurider which again rolIed over his head, be, with a sudden effort, forcod open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided hjm. He was apparentlyunperceived; sor, tbough he called, stiIl the sounds contlnued, and no notice was taken of him. He found hjmseIf in c0ntact with some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a voiee cried, \"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh svcceeded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whose strength seemed superhuman: determiried to sell bis life as dearly as he could, he struggled; bul it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet clnd hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon bim, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throclt\u2014when the glarc of many torches penetrating through the hole that gove light in the day, disturbed hjm;\u2014 he instantly rose, and, leauing his prey, rushed thraugh the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke througb the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by tbose witbout. They entered; lhe light of their lorches fe1l upon lhe mud walls, and the thcltoh loaded on euery indivjdual ftraw with heavy fl akes of soot. At the desire os Aubrey they searched for her who had clttracted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, lo perceive the ajry form of his fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eycs, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imogination; bvt he again saw the same forrn, when he uncloscd them, stretched by hls side. There was no co1our upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness clbout her face lhat \u017feemed alinosl as attachirig as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and vpon her throat were the marks 0f teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneousIy struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter wa\u017f quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sideof hcr wha had lately becn to him the object of so many brigbt and foiry uisions, now fallen with the flower of life tbat had died wilhin her. Ho knew not whal his thoughts wore\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and tclke refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almast unconsciously in bis hand a naked dagger of a parlicular construclion, which had been found in the hut. Thoy were soon met by different partios who had been engaged in the search of hcr whom a molher had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the cjty, forewarnod the parents of s0me dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Au6rey, arid poinled to the c0rse. They were inconsoloble; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey bcing put to bed wcls seized with a most violent fever, and was often dellri0us; in these intervals he would oall upon Lord Ruthven and vpon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccouritable cambination he soemed to beg of his former compclnion to spare lhe being he loved. At other times he would imprecate mclledictions upon bis head, and curse hirn as her deslroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the slate of Aubrey, immediatelyplaced himfelf in the same house, and becarne his con\u017ftant attendant. When the latter rocovered fram his delirium, he wa\u017f horrified and slartled at the sight of him whose imoge he had naw combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, impIylng almost repentclnce sor the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the altention, anxicty, and care which he showed, soon reconciled bim to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no loriger appeared that apathetic being who had \u017fo astonished Aubrey; 6ut as soori as his convalescence begon to be rapid, he again gradually retired irito the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived no differenco from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meel his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inaljcious exultation playing upon his lipf: hc knew not why, hut this smi1e haunted him. During the last \u017flage of tbe invalid's reeovory, Lord Ruthvcn wos apparcntly engaged in watching the tideless wavcs raised hy thc cooling breeze, or in marking the progre\u017fs of those orbs, circling, like our world, the rnoveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wisb to avoid the eyes os all.\nAubrey's mirid, by thjs shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity os spirit which had once so distingvishcd him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude ond silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wis hed for solitude, his mind o0uld n0t firid it in thc neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the rvins he had formerly frequonted, Ionthe's form \u017ftood by his sidc\u2014if he sought it in the woadf, her 1ight step would appear wandering ainidsl the underwood, in quest of the modcst violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pclle face and wounded tbroclt, with a meek smileupon hor lips. He determined to fly scenes, every fca ture of which created sucb bjtter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he hold hlmfelf bound by the tender care he had taken of him during hls illriess, that they sbould visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in euery directi0n, and sought every spot to whicb a recollection oould be attached: but though they thvs hastened from place to plaoe, yet they seemednot to heed whal they gazed upon. Thoy heard mvch of robbers, but they grodually began to sligbt these reports, which they imaglned were only the invention af individualf, whose interest il was to excite the generosity of thase whom they defended from pretended dangers. In corisequence of thus neglecting the advice ofthe inhobitantf, on one occasion they travelled with anly a few guards, m0re to servo as guides than as a dcfence. Upon entering, however, a nclrraw defile, at the bottomof which was the bed of a torrcnt, with large masses of rock brought down froin the neigbbouring precipices, they had reason to repent tbeir nogligonce; for scarcely were tbe whole of the party engaged in the narrow pas\u017f, when lhey were starllod by the whistling 0f bullets close to thejr heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an jnstant lheir guards had lcft them,and, plaeing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the dlrection whenoe lhc report came. Lard Ruthuen and Aubroy, imitating their exomple, rctired for a rnoment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insu1ting shouls bade tbem advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take tbem in the reor, they determined at once to rush forward in seareh of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of tbe rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shal in the shoulder, whicb brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to hi\u017f assistarice; and, no longer hoeding lhe contest or his own pcril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately tbrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend lo a neighbouring ca bin; and having agreed upori a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014thcy being cont ent merely lo guard lhe entrance till their comrade should return with lhe promifed sum, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in twodays rnortification ensued, and dcath seemed advancing wilh hasty stepf. His coriduct and appe arance had not changed; he seemed as uncoriscious of pain as he had been of the objects clbout him: but towards the close of lhe last evening, bis mind became apparen lly uneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrcy, who was jnduced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestriess\u2014\"Assist me! y0u may save rne\u2014you may do morethan that\u2014I mean not my lifc, I heed the death of my existerice as littlc as that of the passing day; but yov may save rny honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my Iife ebbs apace\u2014I canriot explaln the whole\u2014but if you would coneeal alI you know of me, my honour were freo from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my deatb were uriknown sor some time in Engla nd\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\" It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself wjth exultarit violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear lhat, for a year and a dayyou wiIl nol impart your knowledge of my crimes or deatbto any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sookets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAu brey retired to rest, but did not fleep; the many circumstancef attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering oame over him, as if from the presentiment of somcthing horrible awaiting him. Rising ear 1y in the morning, he was about to enterthe hovel in which he had left the corpse, wben a robber met him, and lnformed him thot lt was n0 longcr there, havjng been conveyod by himself and comrades, upon his reliri ng, to the pirinaclo of a neighbouring inount, according to a p romjse they had given his lordship,that it \u017fhou1d be e xposed t0 the first cold ray of the moori thal rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several os the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, wheri hc had mourited ta tho summit be found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though lhe robbers swore they pointed out the idenlical rock on which they bad laid the body. For a time his mind was b ewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they hcld buried the corpse sor the sake of the clothe\u017f.\nWeary af a country in which he had met with such torrible misfortvnes, arid in whjch all apparenlly conspired to heighteri that superstitious melancholy that had \u017feized upon his mind, be resolved to leave it, and saon arrived at Smyrna. While waitlng for a uessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arrclnging those effects he had with him beloriging ta Lord Rulhven. Amongst other things there was o cose coritaining \u017feveral weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensvre the death of the victirn. There were sevcral daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, whot was hi\u017f surprise at finding a shealh apparently ornomented in the same ftyle as the dagger discavered in the fatal hut\u2014he \u017fhuddered\u2014hastening to gain furthor proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined whon he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shapod, the sheath he held in hjs hand. His eyes seemed to need no furthcr certainty\u2014they seoined gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular sorm, the samc varying tints upon the haft and \u017fheath were al ike in splendour on botb, and left no roam for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way hoine, at Rome, hjs first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Rutbven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their f0rtune ruined, and she had not been heard os since the departuro of his lordship. Aubrey's mirid became alinost broken under so many repeated borror\u017f; he was afraid that this lady had falIen a victlin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his 0nly occupati0n consjsted in urging the speed os the postilionf, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arriued at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, s0on wafted him to the EngIish shores; clnd he hastenod to the mansion os his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lo\u017fe, in the einbraces arid caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine cclresses, had gainod his affcction, now that the woman began to appoar, she was still more altacbing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had nol that winning groce which gains the gaze and applcluse of the drawing-room clssemblief. There was none of that light brllliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her 6luo eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charrn about it which did riot seem to arise frommisfortune, but from some feoling wilhin, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'or a butterfly or a colour mcly attract\u2014it was sedate ond pensive. When alone, her face was nover brightened by the smile of joy;but wheri her brother broathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed hjs rost, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet onIy eighteen, and had n0t been presenled to the world, it havingbeen thought by her guardianf more fit lhal hor presentati0n should be delayed until her brother's return fr0m the ooritinent, when he might be her protector. It was riow, theresore, resolved lbat the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, sbould be the cpoch of ber entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancboly w bich ov erpowered bim. He could not feel interest obout the frivolities of fashionable strangers, wheri his mind had been so torn hy the ovents he had witne\u017fsed; but he detormined to socrifiee bis own comfort to the protection of his sistor. They soon arrjved in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced a\u017f a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-ro0m had not 6een held for a long time, and all who were anxious t0 bask in the smile of royalty, hastenod thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilc he was standlng in a corner by himself, heedIes\u017f 0f all around him, engclged in thc remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014hc felt himselfsuddenly sei2ed by lhe clrm, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon bis first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs alm0st refusjng to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself jnto his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, ond fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin\u2014circumstancos started up in dreadful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his 0ath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe il possible\u2014the decld rise agairi!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind wa\u017f resting upon. It was impossible that it could be recll\u2014he determjned, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to clsk concorning Lord Rutbven, tbe name hung upon his lips, and he could not suceeed in gaining informatiori. He went a few nights aster witb his sister to thc as\u017femb1y of a near relation. Leaving her under the protecti0n of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsels up to his own devouring tboughts. Percejving, at last, tbat many wcre leaving, he roused himself, and entering onother r0om, found hi\u017f sifter surrounded by several, appareritly in earnest conversation; he altempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requcsted to move, tumed r0und, ond revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forw ard, seized his sister's orrn, and, with hurried step, forced hor towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of seruants who were waitlrig for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard thal voice whisper clase to hjm\u2014\"Remernber your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurryjng his sister, soon rcacbcd home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind bad been absorbed by one subjcct, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that tbe eertainty 0f the inonster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it wasin vain that she iritreated him lo explain to her what had cavsed hjs abrupt coriduct. Ho only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thougbt, the more ho wos bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was he then to allow thi\u017f monster to roam, bearing ruin upon bis breatb, amidst all he held dear, and not avert ils progress? His very sister might have been tovched by him. Bul even if he were lo break his oath, and disclose his suspicioris, who would believe him? He thought ofemploying his own hand to free the world from suoh a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw rio one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes ftreaming with toars, besaught him, for her sake, to supportnoture. At last, no longer capable of bearingstillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed frorn slreot to street, anxiovs to fly that image which haunted him. Hjs dress became neg1ected, and he waridered, as often exposed to tbe noon-day sun as to tho midnight damps. He was no loriger to be recognized; at first he retumed with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sisler, anxjous f0r his safety, employedpeople to follow hjm; but they were soon di\u017ftanced by hirn who fled from a pursuer swif ter than any\u2014from thought. Hisconduct, however, suddenly cbanged. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole af his friends, with o fiend amongst them, of whose prc\u017fence they were unconscious, he determined to cnter again inlo society, and watcb him closely, anxious to foreworn, in spite 0f his oath, a1l whoin LordRuthven approached with intim acy. But when he entered into o r0om, his haggard and suspicious 1ooks were so strikirig, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged ta beg0f him to obstain from sce-\nking, for her sake, a society which asfectod him so strongly. When, however, remonstronce proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they lhovght it high time to resume again that t rust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous af saving him from the injuries andsufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderirigs, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considerod folly, lhoy ongaged a physician to reside in the house, andtake coristant care of him. He hard1y appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed 6y one terriblesubject. His incohercnce became at last so great, that he wa\u017f c0nfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, bis eyes had atlclined a glassy lustre;\u2014tbe only sign of clffection and recoIlectionremainirig displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then be would s0metimes start, and, selzing her hands, with looks thal severcly afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch hlin. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your loue for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom be referred,his only answer was, \"True! trvc!\" and again ho sank into a state, whence not evcn she c0uld rause him.This lasted mony months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoberences became less frequent, clnd his mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians obferved, that several times in the day he wovld counl upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elclpsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians enterlng his room, began to convorse with his physician upon tho melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's beirig in so awful a sltuatiori, when his sister was gojng next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he askedanxiously to wbom. Glad of this mark of returning jntellect, of whjcb they feared he had been deprived, they rnentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom be had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by hls oxpressing his intention to be pre\u017fent at the nuptials, arid desiring to see his sister. They answered riot, but in a few miriutes his \u017fister was with him. He was apparently clgain capable os being clffected by the infIuence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being orice mare alive to the foelings of affection. He began to speclk with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulote her upon her marriage wilh a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplisbrnent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was hif surpriso at boholding the features of the monster who bad so long inflvericed his life. Hc seized the portra it in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under fool. Upon her asking him why he tbus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014t hen soizirig her bands, clnd gazing on her with a frantic exprcssion of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, lhjnking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the gvardions and physician, wha had heard tbo whole, and thought this was bul a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired bcr to leave him. Ho felI upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken posfesslon of his mind, endeavoured to pclcify bim, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming clfter the drawing-room, and had been resused with every one else. Whon he heard of Aubrey'\u017f ill health, he readily understood hlmself to be the cause of it; but when he 1earned that he wa\u017f deemed insane, his exultation and pleosurecould hardly be coricealed from thoseamong wh0m he had gclined this information. Hc haslened to the house of his former companion, and, by constarit attendance, and tbe pretenoe of great asfectian for the brothor and interest in hisfate, he gradually wan the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recounl\u2014could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on tbe crowded earlh, sove with her ta whom he addres\u017fed himself;\u2014oould tell how, since ho knewher, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well haw to use thc serpent's art, or such was the will os fate, that he gajned her affeetions. The title of the elder branch falling at l ength to him, he obtajned an importarit embassy, whioh served cl\u017f an excuse for hasteriing the marriage, (ln spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place tbe very day before his deporture for the continent.\nAubrey, when he wa\u017f left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe lhe servarits, but in vain. He osk ed f0r pen clnd paper; it was givon bim; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjvrlng her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who orice heId her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounecd the m0st heavy curses. Tbe servanl\u017f promised they would deIivcr it; but giving it to the phy\u017fician, he thought it better nol to harass any mare the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what hc considered, the ravings of a mclnioc. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the houso; and Aubrey heard, witb a horror that may more easily be conceived than descrjbed, the notes of busy preparatian. Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avbrey grew almo\u017ft frantic. The curio\u017fity of the seruants at last overoame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old womari. He seized the opportunlty, with one b0und was out of lhe raom, and in a moment fovnd himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to percoive him: he immediately approaehed, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not my brido to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying,he pushed him towards hi\u017f attendants, who, roused by the o1d woman, had eome in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had br0ken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was riot mentioned to his sjster, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitatirig her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom lest Lo ridon.\nAubrey's weakne\u017fs increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guordians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related cornposedly what the reader has perused\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. L0rd Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACTOF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before hjm, wbere to choose his place of rest, and Prouidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harb0ur of Mltylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certairi supply af cattle arid vegetables always to bo had there, induce many British ve\u017fscls to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though il lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smy-\nrncl, itf bounties amply repay for the devi-\nation of a voyage. We landed; a\u017f ufual, at the hottom of the bay, arid whjlst the men were employed in watering, and the pvrser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself look a ramble to tbe cave caIled Homer's School, and other places, where we had bccn before. On the brow of Mount Ida(a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a y0ung Greek as our guide, who told us be had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival iri his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and would have ta ken me wilh him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I clm likely to get marricd. Hewas an odd, but a very good man. The cottage ouer the biIl, facing lhe river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in chclrge of it: he gave Dominick, thc wine-trader, fix hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English ovrrency,) and has resided there about fourteen moriths, though not constantly; for he saiIs in his felucca very ofleri to the different islands.\"\nThis accovntcxeited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old man, who oonducted us over tbe mansion. It consisted of four aparlments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting pclrlour, and a b ed-roorn, wilh a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decoratcd: plclin green-stained waIls, inarble tables 0n either fide, a large myrtle in the centre, and o small fou-\nntain beneath, whjch could be made to play through the hranchos 6y moving a spring fixed in the side of a \u017fmall bronze Venus in a leaning pofture; a large couoh or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall staod half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrars, nor a single painting. The bcdchamber had merely a lclrge mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillaw\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble reeess, formerly, the old man told us, filled wilh books and paperf, whjch wore then in a large seaman's cbest in the claset: it was open, but we did not think 0urselves justisied in examining the coritenls. On the tablet of the rece ss lay Vallaire's, Shakspeare'f, Boileau's, and Rousseau'f works complote; Volney's Ruinsof Empire\u017f; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopftock's Messiah; Kotzebve's novels; Sohiller's p1ay af the Robbcrs; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italion editian, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constaritinople, mueh torn, but no English book of any descrjption. Mostof these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was ljtera1ly scrib bled alI ovcr, and marked witb flips of paper, on whieh also were remarks.\nThe old mari said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailcd, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for hc is so particular, that wero I to move one thing with0ut orders, he would frown upon me for a weck together; be is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I haue lhe produce of thls farm for the trouble of taking care of il, except twenty zechines which I pcly to an aged Armenian who resides in cl small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for whal reason.\"\nThe appearonce of the bouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty pacc\u017f long and fourteen broad, and the flutcd marble pillars with black pljnths clnd fret-work carnices, (cls it is now customary in Grecian arehitecture,) were considerablyhigher thcln the roof. The roof, svrrounded by a light stono balustrade, was covcred by a fine Turkeycarpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse Iinen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greek\u017f pass tbeir evenirigs in smoking, drinking llght wines, \u017fuch as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evenirig breeze.\nOn the lest harid as wc entered the house, a small \u017ftreamlet glided away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustcrjng together on ils borders, and vnder the \u017fhade of two large myrtle bushes, a marblc seat wilh an ornarnental wooden back was placed, ori which we were told, the lord passedmany of his evenirigs and nights till lwelve o'clock, readjng, writing, and to1king to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church lwice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew from thjs seat was what may be termed \"a bird'f-oyo view.\" A line of rich vjneyards 1ed lbe eye to Mount Ccllcla, covered with olive and myrtlo trees in blaom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared ln majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins defceri ded in brokeri coscades, until it was lost jn the woods near the mounlain's base. The sca smooth as glass, and an hor-\nizon unshadowed by a single cIoud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, tbrough a vista of lofty chesnvt and palrn-trees, several small islands were distinetly abservod, studding the light blue wave with spolf of emerald greon. I seldom enjoyed a view more thcln I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to lhe namo of thc persan who had resided in lhis romantic soIitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said ovr conduotor, \"could tell, bvt I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old fricnd?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We hadnot time to vjsit the Armenjan, but on our return to the lown we learnt severaI particu1ars af tho isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when be was lost upon the i\u017fland, and even danced with lhem at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the gjrls who live by weaving these articles. He a1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collecled, to have been a very eccentric and benovolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage th ought proper not to disclose. He hcld a mo\u017ft beautifuI daughter, withwhom the Iord was often seen walking on the sea-share, and he had 6ought her a piano-forle, and taught her hjmfelf lhe use of jt.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylone; our imaginations all on the rock, guessing who lhis rambler lri Greece could be. Hc had money it was cvident: he had philanthropy of dispositlon, and al1 lh0se ecccntricities whicb mark peouliar genius. Arrived at Palermo, al1 our doubts were dispe-\nlled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arcbitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelllng in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trauels on the i\u017fland of Tenedos, and I a1so visitcd him at Mitylene.\" We had neuer tben heard of hjs lordship's fame, as we hcld been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pul int0 our hands wo recognized the rocluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did wo regret not having been more curious in our refearches at tbe coltage, but we consoled ourselues with the idea of retuming to Mitylene on some sulure day; but lo me that day will never return. I rnclke thif statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship'\u017f good name, whioh haf been grossly slandered. He has been described a\u017f of an unfeeling disposition, averso toassociating wilh hurnon nature, or contributjng in any way to so0th its \u017forrows, or add to its plcasuref. The fact is directly the reverse, cls may be plainly gathered from these little anccdotes. All the finer seeli-\nngs of the heart, so olegantly dcpicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, fympathy, and chority appear to guideall his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reafon for marking him as a being on whase heart Religion halh set her seal, and over whose head Berievo1ence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preoeding pleaslng \"traits\" without feeling proud 0f him as a countryman. With respect ta his Ioves or pleasures, I do not assume a right t0 give an opinjon. Reports are ever to bc roeeived wilh caulion, particularly when djreeted clgainst rnan's moral inlegrity; andho who dares justify himself before that awsu1 tribunal where all must appoar, cllone may ce nsure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's chclracter is worthy of his genius. To da good in secret, arid shun the world's app1ause, is lhe surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscienoe.\nTHE END\nGillot, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","44":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Wil1iam Polidori\nTHE superstltion upon which tbis tale is founded is very general in the East. Am orig the Arabians it appoars to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the esta6lishment of Chrislianity; and it ha\u017f anly assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the ldea becoming prevalent, tbat a Latin body could not corrupl if buried in thcir territory, it gradually increased, and formed lhe su6jeet of many wonderful storios, still extant, of the deod rising from their groves, and feeding upon the blood af the young and hoautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variotion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certclin portion of lhe blood of their victims, who became emaciatod, lost their strength, and spoedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fatt ened\u2014and their ueins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skjns.\nIn the London Joumal, af March, 1732, is a curiou\u017f, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, whicb is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hurigary. It appears, lhat upon on examinalion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of thc place, they positively and unanimously asfirined, that, about five years before, a oertain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been hcard to say, lhat, at Cas\u017fovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had becn torinented by a varnpyre, but had found a way to rid himfelf of tbe evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbirig himself with his blood. This preoaution, however, did not prevent him from becorning a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty day\u017f after his death and burial, many persons complained of baving been tormented by him, and a deposition wos made, lhat four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent fu rther mischjef, lhe inhabitants having consu1ted their Hadagni, took up tbe body, and found it (as is supposed to bc usuol in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely sree froin corruption, and emitting clt the mauth, nofe,and ears, pure and slorid blood. Proof having been tbus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stakc was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried oul as dreadfully as if be had bcen alive. This done, they cut off his head, 6urned his body, and threw tbe ashes into his grave. The same measures were odoptedwith the corses of thosc persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their turn, become agents upon others who suruived them.\nThe universal helief is, that a perfonsucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hlinself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here reIated, becauso it secms belter adapted to illustrate the subjecl of the present observations tban any olher instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as cl sort of punishment aster death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, thal lhe decea-\nsed is not orily doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie bis infernaI visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties os kindred arid affeetion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy oorse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haurit the ncltiue place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Thcre from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the slroarn of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for lheir sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing lhem, Tby flowers are witbered on the stem. But one tbat for thy crime mu\u017ft fall, The youngest, hest beloved of all, Shall b1ess thee with a father's riame\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cbeek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which sreezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall toar The trosses of her ye1l0w hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is b0rne away by thee Mcmorial of thine agony! Yet wilh thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sul1eri grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more clccur\u017fed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild hut beautifvl poem of \"Thaloba,\" the varnpyre corse of the Arabian rnaid Oneiza, who is represenled os having retumed from the gravo for the purpose of tormenting him she best laved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinsuIness of ber lifc, she being pourlrayed throughovt tbe whole of the taIe as a complete type of purity and irinocence. The veracious Toumefort gi ues a long accourit in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrisin, to which he pretends to hclve boen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety af anecdotes, and tradjtionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has pul sorth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notie es on thls singularly horrible superstition migbt be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explclnation, and which may now be concludcd by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the ono in m0st genera1 acceptatiori, there are several others synonymous with il, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that ln the inidst of thc dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various partios of the leaders os the ton a nobleman,more remarka6le for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of tbe fair only attracted his attention, that he might by al0ok quell it, and lhrow fear into those breasts wbere thovghtlessriess reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whericc it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whieh, fixing upon thc obiect's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance topierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon thc cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiaritie\u017f caused him to be invited to every house; all wisbed to see him, and thase who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleofed al baving something in their prosenoo capable of engaging tbeir attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whjch never gained o warmer tint, eitber from the blush of modesty, or from the slrang ernotiori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win bis atteritions, and galn, at least, some marks of what they mighl term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been tho inockery of every monsler shewn in drawing-roorns since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\u2014though in uain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes werc apparently fixed upon her'\u017f, still it seemed as if they were unporceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was bclffled, and she left tbe field. But though the common adullrefscould not influerice even lhe guidance of his eyes, it was not tbat the female fex was indifferent to him: yet such wa\u017f the apparont cautiori with wbioh he spoke to the vi rtuous wife and innocent daughler, that few knew he ever addressed himself t0 females. He had,however, thc reputation of a wlnning tongve; and whether it was thot it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a yovng gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: he waf an orphan left with an onIy sister in the posse\u017fsjon of great wealth, by porents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also tohimse1f by guardians, who thaugbt it their duty merely to take care of his forlune, while they relinquished the more jmportant charge of his mlnd to the care of mereeriory subalterns, he cultivated moro his imagination than his iudgment. He hcld, hence, that high roinantic feeling of h0nour and candour, which daily ruiris so mclny milliners' apprentices. He believed clll to sympathisc with virtue, ond thought that vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for lhe picturesque effect of the fcene, as we see in r0mances: he thought that the misery 0f a cottage merely consjsted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and uarious coloured patches. He thought, ln sine, that the dreams of poels were thc realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon bls entering into thc gay ciroles, many mothers surrounded bim, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping fovourite\u017f: the daugbters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and bytheir sparkling eyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into fcllse notians of his talcnts and his merit. Attached as he was t0 the roinance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in tbe tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presenco af a ghost, but from wanl of snvffing, there was no foundation in real lise for ariy of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his\u017ftudy. Finding, howover, some compensation in hls gratlf ied vanity, he was about to re1inquish his dreams, when lhe oxtraordjnary beingwe baue above described, crossed him in his career.\nHewatched him; and the very impossibilily of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs af his observalion of exlernal objects, than the taclt assent to thoir existence, impliod by the avoidance of their contacl: allowing his imaginatjon to picture every thing tbat flattered its propensity to oxtravagclnt ideas, he soon formed this object into the her0 0f a romance, and determined to observe tbe osfspring of hls foncy, rather thon the person before him. Hc became acquainted with him, paid him clttcntions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He grcldually learnt that Lord Ruthven'f affairs were embarras\u017fed, arid soon found, from the notes of preparotion in \u2014 Street, that he waf about to trauel. De\u017firouf os gaining some information respeetjng thjs singular choracter, who, till now, had only whetted hiscurjosity, he hinted to his guardjans, thclt ll was timc for him to perform tbe tour, whicb sor many generatiorishas been thougbt neccssary lo enable tbe young to lake some rapid steps in the career of vice towards puttjng themse lves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing thein to appeor as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned os the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accordirig to the degree 0f skill shewn in carrying them on. They consentod: and Aubrey immediately mentioning bis intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receivc from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by svch a mark ofesteem from bim, who, apparently, had riothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few dclyf they had passcd the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunlty of stvdying Lord Rvthveri's character, ond now he faurid, that, though many moro of his actions were exposed to his view, lhe results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduot. His oompanion was profuse in bis liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and tbe heggar, received sromhis hand more than enough to relieve their immediote wants. Bul Aubroy oould not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indigence by thc misfortunes att endant even upon virtue, that he bestowed hjs alms;\u2014these were serit from thc door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profIigate came to a\u017fk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow bim to wallow iri his lust, or to sink him sllll deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This wa\u017f, h0wever, attributed by bim to the greater importuriity 0f the vicious, which generally prevails over the rotiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thero was ono circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still more impressod upon his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon il, for they were all either led to the scafsold, or funk to the lowesl and lhe most abiecl misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companjon sought for tbe centres of all fasbionoble vice; there he entered into all the spirit af the faro tab1e: he hetted, and always gclmbled with success, excopt wbere the known \u017fbarper was his antagonist, arid then be lost everi more thari he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watebed the society around: it was nol, howcver, so when he ericountered the rash yovthful novice, ar the luckless fatber of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid oside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from tbe circle he odorned, cursing, in the solitude of a durigeon, the fate that had drawn hlm within lhe reach of thi\u017f fiend; whilst mariy a father sat frantic, ainidst the speaking looks of inute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith t0 buy even sufficient to satisfy their preserit craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tab1e; but immediotely lost, to the ruiner of ma ny, the last gilder he had just sncltched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mlght bul be the result of a certclin degree of knowledge, which was not, bowever, oclpable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey oftcn wished to represent this lo hif friend, and beg him to resign that charity and p1easure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaklng frankly and openly to him; however, lhis never occurred. Lord Ruthven in bis carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nat ure, was cllways the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the ohject of his curiosity, he obtained no greater grcltification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exa1ted imagination began to assume thc appearance of somethirig superriatural.\nThey soon arriued at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his c0mpanion; he lefl him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italjan countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of anotber a1most deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager jmpatience; the first wa\u017f from his sister, brealhing nothing but affection; the 0thors were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had bef0re entered inlo his imagination thal thero waf an evil power resident in his companion, th c\u017fe seemed to give him \u017fufficient reason for the belief. His guardiaris insifted upon his lmmediately Ieaving his friend, arid urged, that his charoctor was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous t0 society. It had beeri discovered, that bis cantempt sor the adultress had not ariginated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratisicatiori, that bis victim, the partner of his guilt, sho uld be hurled srom the pinriacle of unsulliod virtue, dowri to the lowest ahyss of infamy and degradation: in f ine, that all those femoles whom he had sought, appareritly on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown evcri the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, wbose character had not yet sbowri a single bright point on which to rest tho eye. He resolved to invent \u017fome plausible pretext for abandorijrig him altogether, purpo\u017firig, in the mean while, to watch him more cIosely, arid lo let no slight circumstances pass by unnotjced. He entered into the same circle, andsoon perceived, thclt his Lordship was erideavouring lo w0rk upon tbe inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chief ly frequented. In Italy, it is feldom that ari uninarried female is met witb in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in se cret; but Auhrey'f eye followed him in al1 his windings, and s0on discovered thot an asslgnation bad been appointcd, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing rio time, he entered the apartment of L0rd Ruthven, clnd abruptly asked him his intentionf with respoct ta tbe lady, informing him at tbe same time that he was aware of his being about to inoet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such os he supposed all wovld have upori such an ocoasion; and upon being pressedwhether he iritended to marry her, mercly laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, tbat from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the romainder of their propased tour, he 0rdered bis servant to seek other apartment\u017f, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed ber of allhe knew, not only with regard to her davghter, hut cllso conoerning the oharacter of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his oomplctc assent to a separation; bul did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHoving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towords Greeee, and crossi ng thc Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his resldence in the house of o Greek; arid soon occupied himself in traeirig the faded records of ancjent glary upon monumerits that apparently, ashclined of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden tbemselv es beneath the sheltering soi1 or mariy c0lavred lichen. Under the sarne roof as him\u017felf, existed a being, so heautiful and delicote, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing to p0urtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithfuI in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had nosouls. A\u017f she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who wouldhave cxchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animcll \u017fuited but to the taste os ari epicure. The light \u017ftep of Ianthe oftenaccompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquilies, and often would the vneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit os a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beavty of her form, floating a\u017f it were upon lhe wind, to the eoger gazo of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon ari almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often wouldher lresses faIling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun'\u017f ray such dolieately hrilliant and swiftly fading hucs, it might well excuse the forgetfuInefs of lhe antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a pafsage in Pausanias. But why attempt to dcscribe charms which all feel, but none ean appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stiflirig balls. Whilst he drew those remains of wbich he wished tapreserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and wotch the magic effects of his pericll, in tracing the scenes of her nalive place; she would lhen describe la him the circling dariceupon the open pIain, wa uld paint, to him in all the glowlng colours of yout hful momary, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in bor infancy; and then, turnirig to subjeets that had evidently made a greater iinpression upon her rnind, would tellbim aIl the supematural tales of her nurse. Her earriostness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exoited the interest even of Aubrey; arid often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, arid dea-\nrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female lo prolong his exislence s0r lhe ensuing months, his blood wouId run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her 0ut of such idle arid horrible fantasies; hut Ianlhe cited to hirn the names of old men, who had at Iast delected one living ainong themse1ves, after several of their near rclatives and children had been saund marked with tho stamp of the fiend's appelite; and wheri she found him so incredulous, sho begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, thal those wh0 had dared to question thoir exjftence, always had some proof given, whioh 0bliged them, with grief and hear tbreaking, to confess it was true. She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of the\u017fe monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a prelty accurate descrjption of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still porsisted in persuading hor, that there could be no truth in her fears, though al the sarne lime he wondered at the many coincidcnces whioh had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself morc and more lo Ianthe; her innocence, so oontrosted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while hc ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, stlll he found hims-\nelf more and more attaehed to the almost fairy sorm before him.He would tearhimself at times from her, and, forming a plan for s0me antiquarian refearch, he would depclrt, delermined not to return until hjs object was attained; bvt he always found il impossihle lo fix his attention upon the ruins around him,whjlst in his mind he retairied ari imagethat seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of bis love, and was ever the \u017fame fr ank infantile belng he had first known. She alwoys \u017feemed to part from him with reluctance; but it wa\u017f because she had rio longer any one with whom she could visitber fovourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uricovering some fragment which bad yet eseaped the destructive hand af time. She had appealcd to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they botb, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to prooeed upon one af his excursions, which was to detairi hjm for a few hours; when they heard the nclme of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return atnight, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, clftcr the day had closed, upon any c0nsideration. They described il cls the resort of the vampyres iri tbeir riocturnal orgios, and denounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon hiin wbo dored to crosf their path. Auhrey made light of lbeir represontations, arid tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thuf lo mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of whioh opparenlly made their blood frecze, he was sj1ent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off vpan hjs excursion unattendcd; he was surprised to obferve the melancholy face os his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking thebelief os those horriblc fiends, had inspired them with svch terror. When he was about to depclrt, Ianthe came to the side of hls horse, and eamestly begged of him to return, ere ni ghl allowed the power of lheso bclngs to be put in aetion;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occvpied in his research, that he did not perceive tbat day-light would soon end, and tbat in the horizon there was orie of those speoks which, in the warmer climates, \u017fo rapidly gathor into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determjned t0 make upby speed for his delay: bul it was tao late. Twilight, in these sout-\nhern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere be had advanced for, the power of the storm was above\u2014its ech0ing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heauy roin forced its way lhrough the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Svddenly his horsc took fright, and he was carricd with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through satiguo, stopp ed, and he sound, by the glare of lightning, tbat he was in the neighbourhood 0f a houel that hord1y lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood wbich surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one t0 guide hlm to the town, or at least trusting to abtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear tho drea-\ndful shrieks of a woman mingllng with the stlfled, exultant mockery of a lavgh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: bvt, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his hcad, he, with a sudden offort, forced open the door of the hvt. Ho found hirnself in vtter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparcntly unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of hiin. He found himself in contaot wilh some 0ne, whorn he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agaln basfled!\" to which a loud laugb suoceeded; and ho folt hirnself grappled by one wh0se strength seemed superhum an: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemythrew himseIf upon him, and kneoling upon his breast, had placed bis hands upon bis throat\u2014when the glore of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rofe, and, leaving his prey, rushcd throvgh the door, and in a momeril the crashing of lhe branches, as he broke throu gh the w0od, was n0 longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incclpable of moving, was soon heard by those without. Tbey entered; the llght of their torches feIl upon the mud walls, and the tbatch loadod on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for ber who had attracted bim by her cries; he was again lcft ln darkness; 6ut what was his horror, wheri the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to percelvetbe airy form os his fair conductress brought in a life1ess corse. He fhut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visi0n arising from hi\u017f disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, wheri he unclosed tbem, stretched by hls side. There was no colour upon her cheek, riot even upon hor lip; yet th ere was a stillriess about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwell there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, orid upon her throat were the markf of leeth hoving aponed the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror,\"A Vampyre! a Vampyrc!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately beeri to him the 0bject of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise that had died withln her. He knew not what his thoughts were\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemod to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held aImost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which hadbeen sound in the hut. They were so0n metby djfferent por-\ntief who had boen engaged in the searcb of her whom cl mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approaebed the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \u2014To describe tbeir grlef would be impossible; but when lhey a\u017fcertained the cause of their ebild's death, they looked al Aubrey, clnd poinled to the corse. They were inc0nsolabIc; hoth died broken-hearted.\nAuhrey being put to bed was seized with a mosl violent fever, and was often delirious; in those intervals he w0uld call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by same unoccountable combination he seemed to beg of his sormer companion tospare the being he loved. At other times he would iinprecate maledictions upon hjs head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this tiine to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever moljve, upon hearing ofthe state of Aubr ey, immediately placed himself iri the same house, and became his constant attendclnt. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined wlth that of a Vampyro; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost rcpenlance for the fault that had caused their separatlon, and stilI moro by the attention, anxiety, arid care which he showed, soon reconciled him to hjs presence. Hls lord\u017fhjp seemed quite changed; he no l0nger appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Au6rey; but as soon as his convaIescenoe be gan to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Auhrey perccived no difference from the former man, except that at tjmes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intentlyupon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this fmilo haunted him. During the lclst stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watehing the tideless waves raised by the coo1ing breeze,0r jn rnarking tho progress of those orbs, circljng, like 0ur world, the moveless svn;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish lo avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's inirid, by this shock, was rnuch weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which bad once s0 distinguished bim now seemed to have fled for ever. He was riow as much a lover of solitvde and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much cls he wished for solitude, his mind could not find il in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought il in the woods, her light \u017ftep would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lhen suddenly turriing r0und, wouId sh ow, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throal, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by tho tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they sbould uisit those parts 0f Greeee neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and soughl every spot to which a recollection could be attached: 6ut though they thus hastened from pIace to pIace, yel tbey seemed not to heed whal they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they jmagined were only the invention of in dividuals, whose interest it was to excite lhe generosity of tbose whom they dcfended from prelended dangers. In conseqvence of thus neglectjng the advjce of the inhabitants, ori orie occasion they trave1led with only a few guards, more ta serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enlering, howevor, a narrow desile, at tbc boltom of whjch was the bed os o torrent, with large masse\u017f of rock brought down from theneigbbouring prccipice\u017f, they bad reason to repent lheir negligenee; for scarcelywere the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were slartled by the whist ljng of bvllets olose to their heads, clnd by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behirid rocks, had begun to fire in the direoliori whence the report camc. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitatlng their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering lurri of tbe dcfile: but a\u017fhamed of beirig thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, is ony of the robbers should cllmb above and lake them in tho rear, they determined at once t0 rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the roek, when Lard Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to the grovnd. Aubrey hastencd to his assistarioe; clnd, no longer heeding the eontest or hif 0wn peril, was soon surprlsed by seeing the rabbers' faoes around hjm\u2014his guards having, upan Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immedialely thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises os great reward, Auhrey soon induced tbern to convey his wounded sriend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransorn, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guclrd the entrance till their comrade should retum with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven'\u017f strengthropidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; ho seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of thc objects about him: 6ut towards the close of the last evcnirig, his inind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixcd upon Auhrey, who was induced to offer hi\u017f assistance with more than usual earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more lhan that\u2014I mean not my ljfe, I heed the death of my existence as little as tbat of the passing day; but you may sove my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell mo how? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life ebbs apclce\u2014I cannot explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, iny honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and is my death were unknown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raifirig himself with exvltant violonce, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart y0vr knowledge of my crimes or death to ony living bcirig in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed 6ursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrcy; he sunk laughing upon his pill0w, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending hif acquaintance with this man rose upori his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his 0ath a cold shivering came over him, as is from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting bim. Rjsing early in the mornlng, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left tbe corpse, when a rohber met him, and iriformed him that it wcls no l0nger tbere, having beeri conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring,to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promife they had giuen his lordship, that it sbould be exposed to lhe firft cald ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and taking several of the meri, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no traoe of either the c0rpse or lhe clothes, lhovgh the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time hi\u017f mind was bewildered jn conjectures, bvt hc at laft returned, convinced that lhey had buried the corpse sor the soke of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in whicb he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in whioh allappclrent1y conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy thal had seized upori his mind, ho resolved to leaueit, and so0n arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupiedhlmself in arranging tho\u017fe effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongft other things there wasa case containing sevoral weaporis of offence, more or less a dapted to ensure the death ofthe victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning thom over, and examining their curious for ms, what was bis surprise at finding a \u017fheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dagger discovered ln the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may he imagined when hc discovered that il fitted, tbough peculiarly shaped, lhesheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemcd gazing lo be bourid to the dagger; yet still ho wi\u017fhed to disbelieve; but the partjcular form, the samo varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendovr on both,and leftno roam sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on hif way home, at Rome, hjs first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivo arts. Her parents were in diftress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heord of sincethe departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became m0r0se and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if be were going to save the lise of some one beheld dear. He arrived at Calclis; a breeze, wbich seemed abedient to his will, soon wafted birn to the English sbores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, arid tbere, for a moinent, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, hy her infantine earesses, had gained his affeclion, now that the woman began to oppear, she was still more attclching as a companjon.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assernb1ies. There was none af that light brilljanoy which only exist\u017f in the heated atmosphere os a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was neuer lit up by the louity os the mind beneath. There was a melancholy eharm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious os o brighter realm. Her step was nat that light footjng, whjch strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alono, her face was neuer brightened by the smlle of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and w ould in her presence forgel those griefs sbe knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smiIe sor that of the volvptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that sace were then playirig in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having heen thought by her guardians more fit that her prcseritation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he rnight be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, whieb was fast approaching, should be thc epooh of her entry into lhe \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rathor haue remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed up0n the melancholy which overpowered him. Ho could not feel interest about the frivolities 0f fafhionable strangers, when his mind hod been so torn by theevents he had witnessed; bvt he determined to sacrifice his awn comfart to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in town, and prepared sor the next day, which hcld been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had n0t been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask jn the smile of royaIty, haslened thither. Aubrey was there with his sisler. While he wa\u017f standing jn a corner by hjmself, heedless of all around him, engclged in tbc remembrance thal the first time hehad seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that very place\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the orm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your ocllb.\" He had hardlycovrage to turn, fearfuI of seeing a speclro that wo uld blast him, whcn he pereeived, at a litllo distance, the same figure wbich had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society.He gazed till his limbs cllmost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paoed the room with hurrjed steps, and fixed his bands upon hif head, as if he were afraid his thoughts wero bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreodful array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused hlmself, he could not believe it possihle\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resling upon. It was impossible that it could be real\u2014he delermined, therefore, to go again into socjety; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the riarne hung upon bis lips, and he could not succeed in gaining jnformation. He went a few nights after with his sister to lhe assembly 0f a near relatjon. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retircd into a recess, and lhere gave himself up lo his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, thot many werc loaving, he roused himself, and entcririg another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appclrently in earncst conversation; be attempled to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round,and revealed to him those features hc most clbhorrod. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurriod step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the erowd of \u017fervants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing lhem, he again heard that voice whisper close lo him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reacbed home.\nAubrey became almost distrocted. If before his mind had becn absorbed by one subject, h0w much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thovghts. His sister'f attentions were now vnhecded, arid it was in vain that she jntreated him to explaln to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and thoso terrisied her. Themore he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\u2014was ho then to allow this monster to ro am, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progresf? His very fister might have beentouchod by hjm. But everi if he were to break his oatb, and disclose his suspicions, wh0 would believe him? He thougbt 0f employing his own hand to frce the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been olready mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ale only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming wlth tears, besought hirn, for her sake, to supporl nature. At last, no longer capable os bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamcd from street to \u017ftreet, anxious to fly lhat image which haunted him. His dress became negIected, and be wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to thc midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned wilh the evening to lhe housc; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overto0k him. His sjster, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow hjm; but thoy were soon distanccd by him who fled from a pursuer swifter lhan any\u2014from thoughl. His conduct, however, sud-\ndenly changed. Struck wjth tbe idea that he left by his absencc the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongsl thom, of whose presencc they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hjs 0ath, all whom Lord Ruthven appraaehed with intimacy. But when he entered inta a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so strjking, his inward sbudderings sa visible, thot his sister was at last obliged to beg of hiin to abst ain from seeking, for her fake, a soci ety which affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, remonstrclncc proved unouai1ing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind wos becoming alienated, lhey thought it high timo to resume again lhat trust whjch had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injurief and sufforings be had dally encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the goncral eye those marks of what they cansidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take coristant care of him. He hardly appeared to noticc it, so compIetely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His lncoherence became at last \u017fo great, that he was confined to his cbamber.Tbere he wou ld often lie for doys, incapable os being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attajned a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of afseclion and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks thot severely afflictod her, he woulddesire her not to toucb him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your love f0r me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to wh0m hc reserred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and agajn he sarik into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted manymonths: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his iricoherences bccame less frequent, and his mind threwoff a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he wovld count upon his fingers a definitc numbor, and then smile.\nThe time had nearIy elapsed, wheri, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began lo converse wlth his physicicln upon thc mclancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so owful a situation, when his fister was going ncxt day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been depriued, lhey mentioned the naine os thc Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still mare by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptjals, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely srnile; for he pressed hcr t0 his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tearf, flowing at the thought of her brother's boing once more alive to the feelings of offection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to c0ngratulate her upon her marrjage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceivod o lockel upan her breast; openlrig it, wbal was his furpri\u017fe at beholding thefeatures of the monster who had so l0ng influenced his lifo. He sei2ed the portrait in a pclroxysm of rogo, and trampled it under fool. Upon her asking him why he thvs destroyed the re\u017femblance of ber future husband, he loakedas if he did not understand ber\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swcar that she would never wed tbis monstor, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him rernember his oath\u2014he turned sudden1y round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime tbe guardians and phy\u017fician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to 1eave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay hut for 0ne day. They, attribvting this to the insariity they iinagined had takeri possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the mornirig after the draw ing-room, and had becn refuscd with every one olse. When he heard of Aubrey's ill heolth, he readjly understood himsels to be the cause 0f it; but when he learncd that he was deemed insane, his exultatjon and pleasvre could bardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this informcltion. He hastened lo the house of his former companion, and, by constarit attendanoe, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist his power? His tongue hcld dangers clnd toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of ari individual having no sympathy wilh any being on the crowdedearth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of preservation, lf it were merely that he might listen to hersoothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use tbe serpent's art, or svch was the will of fate, that he gajned her affectio-\nns. The title of the elder branch falling clt length to him, he obtained ari important embasfy, which scrved as an oxcufe for hastening the marriage, (in fpjte of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place lbe very day before his departure for thc cantjnent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians,attempted to 6ribe the seruants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those n0w in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hopeand the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he donounced the most heavy curfes. The servants promised they would deliuer it; but givjng it to the physician, be thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Mis\u017f Aubrey by, what he considered, tbc ravings of a maniac. Night passed an without rest to the busy irimatef of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived thari described, the notes of busy preporation. Mornirig came, and the sourid of carriages broke upan his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curio\u017fity of tbe servonts at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in lhe custody of ari hclples\u017fold woman. He f cized the opportunity, with one hound was out af tbc room, and in a momont found hiinfelf in the apartment where all were noarly assombled. Lord Ruthven was the sirst t0 porceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurried bim from the r0om, speechlesf with rage. When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Reinember your oalh, and know, is not my bride to day, your \u017fi\u017fter is dishonovred. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pvfhod him towards his attendarits, wha, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer svpporthimself; his rage riot finding vent, had broken o blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to bis sister, who was not present when he enlored, as the physician was afraid of agitaling her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom lefl London.\nAubrey's weaknefs increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of dealh. He desired his sister's guardians might be cal1ed, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composed1y what the reader has perused\u2014he died lmmcdiately after.\nThe guardians hastened lo protect Misf Aubrey; but wben they arrived, it wa\u017f too 1ate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubre-\ny's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, whore t0 choose his place of resl, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing lhrough the Grecian Archipelago, an boclrd orie os his Majesty's ve\u017fsels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, inthe island of that name. The heauty of this place, and the certain fupply ofcattle ond vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\u2014bolh meri of warand merchantmeri; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed;as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargainirig for cattle wjth the riatives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where wehad bcen before. On the br0w of Mount Ida (a \u017fmall monticvle so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guidc, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days preuio us to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged mc as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where Iam 1ikely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over lhe hill, facing tbe river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dorninick, the wine-trader, \u017fix hundred zechines for it, (about Lz50 English curreney,) and has rcsided there about fourteeri rnonths, though not constantly; for be sails in his felucca very often to the difsererit islands.\"\nThis account exciled ovr curi0sity vory much, and we lost no timc iri hastenlrig to thebouso where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man,who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted 0f four apartments on the grourid-floor\u2014an entrance haIl, a drawing-room, a sitting parIour, and a bed-room, with a \u017fpocious closet annexed. They were all simply docorated: plairi green-stained wallf, marble tables on ejther side, a large myrtlo in the centre, anda small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a sprjng fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leanjng posturo; a large cauch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall \u017ftood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: therc wereno mirrors, nor a single pointing. The bedchamberhad mercly a large mattress sprecld on tbe flaor, with two \u017ftuffed cotton qujlts arid a pillow\u2014the common bed througbout Greece. In the sitting-room we ohsorvod a marble recoss, farmerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papors, which were tbon in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it waf open, but we did n0t think ourselues justified in exominjng the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's,Shakspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermori, in the German longuage; Klopstack's Messlah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller'\u017f play of the Rob6ers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, pririted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from thc Greek pre\u017fs at Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English book of anydefcription. Most of these b0oks were filled with marglnal noles, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of papor, onwhich cllso were remarks.\nTho old man said: \"Tbe lord had 6een reading these books the evenlng before be sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bul,\" said he, \"there they must 1ie until his return; for he is so particular,that were I to move one lhing without orders, hc would frown upori me for a week together; hc is otherways very good. I ance did him a \u017fervice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble os taking care of it, except twenty zechines wbicb I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a smalI cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The p ortico in frant was fifty paces lorig and fourteeri broad, ond the fluted marble pillars with bla ck plinths and fret-w0rk cornices, (as itis now oustomary in Greciari architecture,) werc considerably higher than the raof. The roof, surrounded by a light stane balustrade, wa\u017f c0vered by a sine Turkey cclrpet, beneath an awning os slrong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops aro thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smoking, drinking light wines, svch as \"lachryma christi,\" eallrig fruit, and enj0ying the evening breeze.\n0n the left hand as we entered the house, a sma1l streamlet glided away,grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, clnd under the shade of twa large myrlle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\"for he was very devout, \"arid always attended our church twioe a week, besides Svndays.\"\nThe view from thi\u017f seat was what may be lermed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A llne of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, coverod with olive and myrlle trees in bloom, arid ori the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing fr0m the ruins descended in brokcn cascodes, until it was lost iri the woods ncar the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a slngle cloud, termlriates the viow in front; and a little on the left, through a visla of lofly chesnut and palm-trees, sevoral small islclnds were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wavc with spots of emerald green. I seldom erijoyed a view more than I dld this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name os the person who had resided in lhis romantic solltude: none knew his name but D0minick, his bariker, who had gone to Candia. \"Tho Armeniari,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said hc, \"I dare not.\" We bad not time to vi\u017fit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt sevcral particulars of the isolated lord. He had porti0ned eight young girls when he wcls last upon the jsland, and even danced with thom at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borsos to oth ers, and cotton and silk lo the gjrls who live by weaving lhesc articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost hls own in a gale, and be often gaue G reek Teslaments to the poor children. In short, he appearod to us, from all we callected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we leamt, whieh our old friend at the cottagc thought proper not to disclose. He bad a most beautiful daughter, wlth whom the lord was oflen seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bougbt her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of jt.\nSuch was the information witb which we departed from the peaceful islo of Mitylene; our imaginations all ori the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evjderit: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecc entricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, allour doubts were dispelIed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, wh0 had been travellirig in Egypt ond Greeco, \"The indjvidual,\" said he, \"about whom yav are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on tho island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then hcard of his lordship's fame, os wc had been same years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognizedthe recluse of CalcIa in every page. Deeply did we regret not having bcen more curious in our researohes at the cotloge, but we corisoled ourselves wilhthe idea of returning to Mitylene onsome future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statemont, belioving it not quite uninteresting, and in justice lo bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been describcd as of an unfeeling disposition, averse lo associating with human nature, or contributing inany way to soolh its sorrows, or add ta its pleasvres. The fact is direotIy the reverse, as may he plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelin gs of the heart, so clegantly depicted in his lordship's pooms, seein to havc their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and chclrity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additi onal reason sor marking him as a being an whose heart ReIigion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lraits\" without feeling proud of him cls a countryman. With respect to his loues or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are evcr to be received with caution, portlcularly when directed against man's moral integrity; arid he wbo dclres justify hirnself before that awful tribunal where all muft appear, alone may censurc the errors of cl fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applausc, is the surest testimoriy of a virluous beart and self-approving consejence.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","45":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tclle.\nBy John Wi1liam Polidori\nTHE superstition upon whichthis tale is founded is very gerieral in lhe East. Among tbe Arabians it appears to be eommori: it did not, howcver, extend itself ta the Greek\u017f until after the establishinent of Cbristianity; and it has only a\u017fsvmed its present form sjnce the division 0f the Latin and Greek churches; at which timo, tbe idea becoming preva1enl, that a Lat in body could not corrupt if buried in lheir territory, it gradually increased, and formcd the subject of many wonderful stories, stjl1 extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the y0ung and beautiful. In the West it \u017fpread, with some sIight variation, alI over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whero the belief existed, thol vampyres nightly imbibed a cortain portion of the blood oflheir victim\u017f, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattoned\u2014and their veins became distendcd lo such o slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flowfrom all lhe passclges of tbeir bodies, and everi from the very poref os their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, l732, is a curious, and, 0f course, credible account of a particvlar case of vampyrisin, whjch is statod to have occvrred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It oppears, thal upan an examination of the commander-in-chief and magjstrates of the place, they positively arid unanimously affirmed, tbat, about fivc years before, a certain Hey-\nduke, nclmed Arnold Paul, hcld been heard to soy, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Tv rkifh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself os the evil, by eating sorne af the earth out os the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precautlon, however, did not prevenl hlrn from becorning a varnpyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days astcr his death and burial, many persons complained of havjng been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four person\u017f had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent furtbermischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (asis svpposed to be u\u017fual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emilting at the mauth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus oblained, they resortcd to tbe aocu\u017ftomed remedy. Astake was driven eritirely throvgh tbe heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he i\u017f reported to have cried out as dreadfuIly as jf he had boen alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and t hrcw the ashes lnto his grave. The same measures were adopted with tbe corses of those persons wbo had previously dled from vampyrism, lest they sh0uld, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal 6elief is, thclt a person sucked by o vampyre bccomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief baiIiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is herc rcIated, because il seems better adap ted to illustrate lhe subjecl of the preserit observations tban any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishment after death, for some heirious crime committed whilst in cxistence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his irisernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most whiIe upon earth\u2014those to whom he was b0und by ties of kindred and offection.\u2014A suppositlon alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on eartb, as Vampyre \u017fent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghastly baunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from lhy daughter, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathethe banquet which perforce Must feed tby livid livjng corse, Thy vlctims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sirc; As cursing tbce, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withercd on the stem.

Bul lhis cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenee. Thc ueracious Tovrnefort gives a long occount in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upori this subject, besides cl varjety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learncd dissertations, tending ta prove it to be a classiccll, as well as barbariari error.\nMany curious clnd interesting notices on this singvlarly horrible superstilion mjght be cldded; though lhe present may suffice for the limits os cl note, neoessarily devoted to explanalion, and which may now be concluded by merely remclrking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in rnast general acceptation, there are several olhers synonymous with it, madc use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at tbe various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, tban hi\u017f rank. He gazed upon thc mirlh around him, a\u017f if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he mlght by a lo0k quell it, and throw feor into those breasts where thoughtlessness relgned. Those who selt this senscltion of awe, cauld not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whicb, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, arid at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings af the heart; but fell upori the cheek wjtb a leaden ray that weigbed upon thc skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him lo he invited to every h0use;all wished to seehim, and tbose who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt lhe weigbt of ennui, were pleased at hoving fomething in their prcsence capclble of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hve of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, eilber from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passlon, though it\u017f forrn and outline were 6eautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attenlions, and gain, at least, soine marks of whclt they might term affeetion: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe mockery of euery m0nster shewn iri drawing-rooms since her inarriage, threw herself in bis way, and did all but put on the dres\u017f of a movntobank, to attraot his notice:\u2014though in uain:\u2014when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon hcr's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impudence was 6affled, ond she left the field. Bvt though tbe common adultress cauld not inflvence even tbe gvidance of his eyes, it wcls not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet sucb was the apparent cavtlon with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, tbclt few knew he ever addressed himself to fema1es. He hcld,however, the reputation ofa winning tongue; and whether it was thclt it even overcame the dread of his singular character, ar tbat they were movod by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of thelr sex from their domestic vjrtues, as amang those who sully it by their vices.\nAb0vt the same tjme, there camc to London a young geritleman of thename of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wea1th, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Lcft also to himself by guardians, wbo thought it their duty merely to take careof his fortune, whilo they relinqui\u017fhed themore important chargeof his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated inore his imagination than his judgment. He had, honce, that high romantic feeljng of honaur and candour, which daily rujns so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathjse with virtue, and thaught that vice was tbr0wn in by Providence mere1y for the picturesqve effect of the sccne, as we see inromances: be th0ught that the misery 0f a cottage merely consisted iri the uesting of olothes, wbich were as warm, but which werc better adapted to the painter's eyo by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He tbought, in fine, that lhe dreams of poets were the realilies 0f life. He was handsomc, frank, and ricb: for these rcasons, upon his eritering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishlng or romping favourites: the daughters clt the same lime, by their brighlening countenanccs when he approached, ond by lheir sporkling eyes, when be opened his lips, soon led bim into false notlons of his talentsand his meril. Attaohed af he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except ln the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot from the presence of a ghost, but from wanl of snuffing, there was no fouridation in reaI life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those voluines, froin which he had formed his study. Findjng, however, somo compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish bis dreams, when lhe extraordinary being we have abovo described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibility of forming an ldea of tbe character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of hif observation of external object\u017f, thari the tacit clsscnt to their existence, im plied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his lmagination to picture evory thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of cl romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, poid him attentions, and so far advaneed upon his notice, that his presence wos always recognised. He gradually learnt thot Lord Rvthven's affoirs were embarrclssed, clnd soon found, from the notef of preparation in \u2014 Slr-\neet, that he wa\u017f about to lravol. Desirous of galning \u017fome inforination respecting tbis singular character, who, lill now, had only whettod his curiosity, he hinted to his guardian\u017f, that it was time for him lo perform tbe tour, whichfor many generations bas been thought necessary to en able the young to take some rapid steps in the carecr of vice towards putting themselves vpori an equality wjth the aged, and not allowing them to ap peclr as if fallen from the skies, whenever scaridalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn in earrying them on. They oonsented: and Aubrey immedicltely mentioning his intentions t0 Lord Ruthven, was surprised la receive from him a propofal to join hjm. Flattered by svch a mark of esteem from hiin, who, apparently, had nothing in common wilh olher men, he gladly accepted it, and in cl few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord R uthven's character, and now he found, that, thougb many moreof his actions wereexposed to his view, the refuIts offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companjon was profuse in his liberality;\u2014thc idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, thal lt was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigonce by tho misfortvnes atteridant even upan virtue, tbat he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed fneers; but when the profligclte came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, butto allow bim to wallow in his lust, or to sink him stilldoeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed 6y him to the greater iinportunity of the vjcious, which generalIy prevails over the retiring bashfulness ofthe virtuous indigent. There was orie circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all t hose upon whom lt was heftowed, inevitably sound that there was a curse upon it, for thoy were all either Ied to the scasfold, or sunk to the lawest and the most abiect mifery. At Brussels and othcr towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparcnt eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fasbionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gainbled with success, except where the known sharper was his antag0riist, and then he lost evcn more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with wbich he generally watched the society around: it was not, however,so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish soemed fortvne's law\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mjnd was laid asidc, and his eyes sparkled with more firc than that of lhe eat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly afflu-\nent youth, torn from the circlc he adorned, cursing, in the soIitude of a dungeon, the fate that haddrawn him within the reach os this fiend; whilst mony o father \u017fot frantic, amidst tbe speaking looks of mute hungry childrcn, without cl single farthing of hjs late immense wealth, wberewith to buy even susfjcient to satisfy their present craving. Yot he took n0 money srom tbe gambling table; hut immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mlgbt butbe the result of a certain degree 0f knowledge, which was nol, however, cclpable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wishod to rcpresent this to his friend, and heg him to rcsign that charity arid pleasure which provod the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed il\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speakirig frankly and openlyto him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in hif carriage, and amidst lhe various wild and rich scenef of nalure, was always the same: bis eye spoke less than his ljp; and though Avbrey was near the object of his cvriosjty, he obtained no greater gratificotion from it thari the constant excitement of vainly wishing to hreak that mystery, which tohis cxalted imagination began to assume the appearance of \u017fomething supernatural.\nThey soon clrrived at Rome, clnd Aubrey sor a time lost \u017fjght of his companiori; he left bim in daily atlendance upon lhe morning circle os an Italian countess, whilst he went in fearch of the memorlols of an0ther almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which hcopcned with eager impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affeetion; the others were fram his guardian\u017f, the latter aslonished him; if it had hefore entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residerit in his companjon, these seemed to give him sufficient reasan for the beli-\nef. His guardians insisted upon his immedialely leaving bif friend, and urged, thclt his character was dreadfully vicious, for thattbe passession of irresistible powers of seduetion, rendered his Iicentious habits more dangerous to society. It had heen discovered, that his coritempt for the adultress had riot origiriated in hatred of her character; but that he had rcquired, to enhance his gratification, that bls viotirn, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest ab yss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all thase females whom be had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled t0 expose the whole deformity of the ir vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey dctermined upon leaving one, wha\u017fe chclracter had not yet showri a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausihle pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no sIight circumstancespass 6y unnoticed. He entered inlo the same circle, arid soon peroeived, that his Lordship was endeovouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whosehou\u017fe he chicfly frequerited. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarriod female is met witb in society; hc was therefore obligedto carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windingf, and soon discovered that an assjgnation hod been appointed, which would mast Iikely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losjng no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly askedhim hi\u017f inlentions with respect lo the lcldy, informing him at tho sarne time that he was aware of his belng obout to meet her tbat very night. Lord Ruthven answe-\nre d, tbat his intentjons were svch as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, lmmediately writing a note, to say, that from that momont he mu\u017ft docline accoinpanying his Lordship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other aparlments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only wilh regard to her daughter, bul also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assjgnation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent hi\u017f servant ta notify hif complete assent to a separation; bvt did n0t hint any suspicion 0f his plans haujng been soiled by Avbrey's interpositiori.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Pcninsula, soon found himself at Athens. Ho then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traoing thefaded records ofancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed os chronicllng the deeds of freemen only bofore slaves, hcld hidden themselvcs beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured llchen. Under tbe same r0of as himself, exifted a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she migblhave formed the model for a paintor wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomel's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too rnuch mirid for any one to think fhe cauld be1ong to tbose who hod no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the inountain's side, one would have thought thc gazelle a poor lype of hor beavties; for wbo would have exohanged her eye, apparent1y the eye of animated riature, sor that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey ln his search after antjquities, and often would lhe unconscjous girl, engagedin the pursuit 0f a Ka\u017fbmere butterfly, \u017fhow the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon thc wind, to the eagcr gaze of hlm, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaccd tablet, in the contemplalion of her sylph-like sjgure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray suoh delicate1y brilliant and swift1y fading hues, it mighl wcIl excuse the forgetfulness of the anliquary, who let escape from hjs mind the very object he had befare thought af vital importanceto the proper interpretation of a passage in Pavsanias. But why attempt to doscribe charms which all feel, but rione can apprcciate?\u2014It was innoeence, youtb, clnd beauty, unaffected by crowded drawi-\nng-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remajns of whlcb he wished to preserve amemorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic efsects of his pencil, in tracing the sce nes of her native place; she wovld tben describe to him the clrcling dclnco upon the apen plain, would paint, to him in oll the glowing colovrs of youthful memory, the mclrriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, tvrning to subjects thclt had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supematural tales of hor nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excjted lhe interest even of Aubrey; ond often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, wha had passed years amidst his friendf, and dearesl ties, foroed every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong bis existonce for tbe ensuing rnonths, hi\u017f blood would runcold, whj1st heattempted to laugh her out of such idIeand horrible fantasios; but Ionthe cited to him the nomos of old men, wha had at last detected 0ne living am0 rig themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked wlth the stamp of lhe fiend's appetite; and when sbe found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to qvestion their existerice, always had some proof given, wbich ohliged them, with gries and heartbreaking, to oonfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these moristers, and his horrar was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description af Lord Ruthuen; he, however, still per\u017fisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in herfears, though at the same time he wondered at tbe many coincidences which had all terided to excito a belief in the supernatural power af Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so conlrasted with all the affected virtues of the womon among wham he had sought for his visian of romance, won his beort; and while he rjdiculed the idea of a y0ung man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, ftiIl he sound himself more and more attached to the a lmost foiry forin before hiin. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plcln for some antiqvarian research, be would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he alwclys found it impossible to fix his atterition upori the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightsul possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe waf unconfcious of his love, and was ever the sarne frank infantile heing he had fir\u017ft knowri. She always secmed to part from him with reluctanee; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom shc could visit her favovrite hclurits, whi1sl her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet eseaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parent\u017f on the subjectof Vclmpyres, and they both, with soveral present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the uery name. Soon after, Aubrey deteriniried l0 proceed upon orie of his cxcvrsions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when tbey heard the name of the place, they all at once begged af him not to return at night, as he must necossarily pass through a wood, where no Greek wouldever remain, after the day had closed, upan any consideratlon. They descrlbed it as the resort of the vampyres in theirnocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Auhrey made light of their representalions, and trled to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at hjs daring thus to m0ck a superior, infernal power, the very name of which appclrently made tbeir blood freeze, he was fi1ent.\nNext moming Aubrey set off upon hif excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief os those horrible fiends, had inspired thom wjth such terror. When he wa\u017f about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earneslly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in actiori;\u2014he proinised.He was, however, so occupied in his research, thclt he did not perceive that day-light would so0n end, and lhat in the horizon there was one of those specks wbich, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, howcver, mounted bis hor\u017fe, deterrnined to make up 6y speed for his delay: hut it was too latc. Twilight, in these southern olimales, is alrnoft unknown; immediately the sun sets, night bogins: and ere he had advariced far, the power of tho storm was clbove\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interual of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced il\u017f way through the canopylng foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall clnd radiate at his very feot. Suddenly his horse took fright, and hc was corried with dreadful ropidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, throvgh fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was inthe neighbaurhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead loaves arid brvshwood which \u017furrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find soine one t0 guide him to lhe town, or at least trusting to obtain sheller from thc pelting of thc storm. As he approached, the thunders, sor a moment sil ent, allowed hiin to hear the dreadful shrieks of a wornan mingling with the stifled, exultant mookery of a Iaugh, conlinued in one almast unbrokeri sound;\u2014he waf startled: but, roused by the thunder whicb agajn rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknes\u017f: the sound, h0wever, gulded him.He was apparently unperccived; for, though he called, sliIl the sovnds continued, and no notice was taken of hjm. He fovnd hjmself in contact with some one, wbom ho immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again haffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himseIf grappled by one whose strength soomed supcrhurnan: dotermined to sel1 his life as dearly as he oould, he struggled; but it was in vclin: he was lifted from his feel arid hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enerny threw himself upan bim, and kneeling upon bis breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\u2014when the glare af inany torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in thc day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, arid in a moment the crashing 0f the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now stjll; and Aubrey, incapable of rnoving, was soon heard by those withovt. They entered; the light of their torohes fell upon the mud walls, and lhe thatch loaded on every individval straw with heavy flakcs of soot. At tho deslre of Avbrey they searohod for her wbo had altraoted him by her cries; he was again 1eft iri darkness; bvt what was his horror, when tho light of thc torches once more bursl upan him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductres\u017f brought in a lifeless cor\u017fe. He shut hi\u017f eyos, hoping tbat it was bul a vision arising from hisdisturbed imagination; but he again saw the sarne form, when he vnclosed them, stretched hy bis side. There was no colour upon ber oheek, not oven upon her lip; yet thero was a stiIlness aboulher face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that orice dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! aVampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, arid Aubrey was loid hy the side of ber who had lalely been to him the obiect of so many bright and fairy visions, riow falIen with the flower oflife that had diedwithiri her. He knew not whathis thoughts were\u2014bis mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy\u2014he held almast unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a partioular conslruction, which had been found in the hut. Thcy were soon met by differenl parties who had been engclged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable crie\u017f, as they approached lhe city, sorewarnod the par-\nents of some drecldful catastrophe. \u2014To describe their grief would be impossible; but whcn they ascertained the cause of their child'\u017f de alh, they looked al Aubrey, arid pointcd lo the oorse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often dolirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some vnacoouritable combination he seemed to beg of his former compariion to spare the being he loved. At other tiines he would imprecate maledictions upori his head, and curse him as ber destr0yer. L0rd Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Alhens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same hause, arid became his constant attendant. When tbe latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startIed at the si ght of bim whose image he had riow combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, implying almost repentanco for lhe foult that had cau\u017fedtheir separation, and stil1 more by the attention, anxiety, and care which hc showed, saon reconciled him to his presence. Hjs lordship seemed quite cbanged; he no lorigcr appeared that apathetic being who had so astonjshed Aubrey; bvt as soon as his convalefcericc began to be rapid, he again gradually retired int0 the same state of mind, and Aubrey perccived no difference from the f0rmcr inan, except that al tirnes ho was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upan him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, bvt this smile haunted him. Duringthe last stage of the invalid'f recavcry, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in wa tching the tideless waves raised by the co0ling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, liko our world, tho moveless sun;\u2014indced, he appeared to wlsh to avold the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, bythis shock, wcls much weakened, and that elastioity of spirit which had once so distinguished him naw \u017feemcd to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover af solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for soIitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light \u017ftep w0uld appear wanderjng amidst lhe underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, wo uld show, to his wild imaginotion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meck smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which creoted such bilter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, lo whom he held himself bound by lhe tender care he had takeri of him during his illness, that they should visit thofe parts of Grecce neither hadyet seen. They travelled in every direclion, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus ha\u017ftened from place to pIace, yet they seemed not to beed what they gazed upon. They heord much of robbers, but they gradually begon to slight these roports, whichthey imagined were only the lnvention of individuals, whose interesl it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, ori onc occasion they traveIled with only a few guards, more to serve a\u017f guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a riarrow desile, at the bottom of which was thebed of a torrent, with large masses os rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, thoy had reason to repent their negligence; sor scarccly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, whcn they were startled by the whistljng 0f bullets olose to their heads, and by lhe echoed reportof several guns. In an instanl their guards had left them, arid, placing thcmselves behirid rockf, had begun to fire iri the diroetion whence the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitaling their exomple, retired for a moment behind lhe sheltering turn of the defile: but as hamcd ofbeing thus detained hy a foe,who with lnsu1ting shouts bade them advarice, ond being expased to uriresjsting slaughter, if any of the robbers should clim6 above and take them in the rear, they determined at once torusb f0rward in search of the eriemy. Hardly bad thoy lost tbe shelter os the roek, when Lord Ruthven received a shot jn the shoulder, which brought him to the gr0und. Aubrey hastened to bis assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upan Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up lheir arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubreysoon induced them to convey hjs wounded friend to a rieighbovring cabjn; orid having agreed vpon a ransorn, he was no more disturbed by their prefence\u2014they being content merely to guard the cntrance till lheir com rade \u017fhould return wjth the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreosed; in two daysmortification ensued, and death seerned aduancing with hasty steps. Hi\u017f conduct and appeararice had riot changed; he feemed as unconscious of pain as he had been af thc objocts about him: but towards tbe close of the last evening, his mind becaine apparently uneasy, and his eye oft en fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his clsslstance with mare thon usual eamestnefs\u2014\"Assist me! you may fave me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean nol my life, I heed the death os my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honovr.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my Iife ebbs apace\u2014I cannol explain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in tho worId's mouth\u2014and if my death were unkriown far some lime in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying inan, raising himsels with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear thclt, for cl yeclr and a day yau will not impart yovrknowledge of my crimes or death lo any Iivirig being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever y0u may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hispi1low, and hrcathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mirid, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over hiin, as if frorn the prefentiment of fomething horrible awaitjng him. Rising early in the morning, be was about to enter the hovel in which hc had left the corpse, when a rob6er met him, and informed him that it was no longcr there, having beeri conveyed by himself andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the fjrst oold roy of the inoon that rose after his deoth. Aubrey astonished, and toking several of the meri, dctermjned to go and bury it vpon the spot where it lay. But, whon he had mounted lo lhe suinmlt hc found no trace of either lhe corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out theidenlical rock on which they had lald the body. For a time his mind was bewjldered in conjeclvres, but he ot last returned, convinced that they had bvried the oarpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had inel with such terrible misfortunes, and jn which all apparenlly conspired to heighten that superstitious melaricholy lbat had \u017feized up0n his mind, he resolved to leavo it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Wbile waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging thoso effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthvcn. Amongst other things there was a case contairiing severol weapons of offeri-\nce, more orless adapted to ensurethe death of the victim. There were several dclggers and atagbans. Whilst turning them over, and exomining their curlovs forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style a\u017f the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he \u017fhuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discov-\nered that it filted, though peculiclrly shaped, the sheath he held iri his hand. His eyes seomed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed gazing to 6e bound to the dagger; yet flill he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, lhe same varying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splondour on bot h, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eoch.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his woy home, at Rom e, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduclive arts. Her parents were ln di\u017ftress, their fortune rujncd, and she had not been heard of since the deporture of bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became alm0st broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that thls lady had fallen a victim to the deslroycr of Ianthe. He became morosearid filont; and his only occupat ion consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, cls if he were going to saue the ljse os some one he held dear. He arrived at Calaif; a bree2e, which soemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to tbe English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a rnoment, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gainod his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attoching as a companj0n.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grclce whicb gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room a\u017fsem6lles. There wa\u017f none of that light brilliancy which only exists jn the heated atmosphere os a crowded aparlmerit. Her blue eye wos never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. Therc was a m elancholy charm about it which did n0t seem to arise from misfortune, bvt from somefeeling withiri, that appearod to jndicate a soul conscious of a brighler rcalm. Her step was not thal light footing, which strays where'or a butterfly ar a co1our may atlrclct\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alone, hcr foce was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, arid would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptvary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in thc light of their own naliuespbere. Shc was yet only eighlecn, and had not been presented t0 thc world, it having 6cen thought by ber guardions more fit lhat her presentation fhould bedelayed untiI her brother's returri from thc continent, when he mlght bc her protcctor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, fhovld be tbe epoch of her eritryinto tbe \" busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion os hjs falhers, and fed upon the melaricholy which overpowered bim. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torri by the events he had witriessed; but he determined to \u017fclcrifice his own comfort lo the protection af hls sister. They \u017foon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which hod been clrinounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawirig-room had not beon held f0r a long tim e, and alI wha werc anxious to bask in the smile of roycllty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by hirnself, heedless of all around bjm, engaged in the remembrarice lhat the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvenwos in that very place\u2014he felt himself sudderilyseized by the arm, and a voice hc recognlzed too well,founded in his ear\u2014\"Remember y0ur oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he peroeivcd, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon hjs firfl enlry lnto society. He gazed till his limbf a1most refusing to bear their weighl, he was obliged lo take lhe arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through lhe erowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the roarn with hurried stops, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he werc afraid his thoughts were bursting from hif brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances slarted up in dreadful arrcly\u2014the dagger\u2014his oat h.\u2014He roused hiinself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination had oonjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could he real\u2014hc determined, therofore, to go agclin inla fociety; for though he ottempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upan his lips, and he could not succeed in gclining insorm ation. He went a few nighls after with his sjster to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving hor under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his awn devouring thoughts. Pcrcei ving, at last, that many wero leaving, he roused himself, and ontering another room, found hif sister surrounded by several, appareritly in earnesl conversation; hc attempted to pass and get near her, whori one, whom he requested to movo, turned r0urid, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, clnd, witb hurried stcp, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himsels impeded by the crowd os servants who were waiting for their lords; and w hile hc was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close ta him\u2014\"Romember your oath!\"\u2014He did nol dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey bocaine almost distraeled. If 6efore his mind had beeri absorbed by one svbjecl, how much more completely was jt engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon bis thougbts. His slster'sattenlions were now unheeded, and it wos in vairi thal she intreated him to exp1ajn to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only utlered a sew words, and those terrified her. The more hc thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startIed hlm;\u2014was he lhen to allow this monster to roam, bearjng ruin upon his breath,amidst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very si\u017fter mjght bave been toucbod byhim. But everi if he were to break his oath, and disclose his \u017fu\u017fplcions,who would believe hirn? He thougbt of empIoyjng his own hand to free the world frorn fucb a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For dayf he remained in this state; shut up in his room, be saw no one, and ate only when his sistcr came, who, witheyes strcaming with tears, besought bim, for her sake, ta support nature. Al l ast, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he 1eft hif house, roamed from street to ftreet, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to thenoon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. Hc was no longer to be recognized; ot first be returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherover fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his \u017fafety, employed people to follow bim; but they were soon distanoed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\u2014f-\nrom thought. His conduct, howevcr, suddenly chclnged. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose preserice they were vnconscious, he determined to enter again jnto society, and watch him closcly, anxious to forewarn, jn spite of hif oatb, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he enterod into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from \u017feeking, for her sake, a sociely which affected him so strongly. When, howover, remonstrance proved uriauai1ing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearirig that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before irnposed upon tbem by Aubrey's par ents.\nDesirous of saving him srom the irijurics and sufferirigs he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him srom exposing to the generaI eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physicianto r esido in the hovse, and take constant cclro of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mlnd absorbed by one tcrrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was consined to hl\u017f chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, inoapable of being rou\u017fed. He had becoine emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of afsoction and recollection remaining djsplayed itself upon the entry of his sister; lhen be would sometirnes start, and, seizing her hands, with Iooks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch bim. \"Oh, do riot touch bim\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, howevor, she iriqvired to whom he referred, hif only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into o state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many monthf: grodually, howeuer, as the year was passing, his incoherences beca me less frequent, and his mind thrcw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians obscrved, that sevorol times in the day he would courit upon his fingers a definitc nvmber, and then smile.\nThe time hcld nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his gvardians entering his room, began to eonverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstan ce of Avbrey's being in s0 awful a situalion, when his sisler wos going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attentian was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad 0f this mark of returning intellect, of which they fear ed he had been deprived, they mentioned the name 0f the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seomed plcased, and astonished them still more by bis expressing his inlention to be present at the nupticlls, and desiririg to see his sjster. They answered not, but iri a few mjnvtes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the insluonce of ber lovely smile; for he pressed her to hif brcast, and kjssed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother'\u017f being once more alive to the feeIirigs of offectian. He began to speak with all his wanted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accompli\u017fhment; whcn be suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; opening it, whal washis surprise at bebolding the features os the monstcr who hod so long influenced his life. He seized the porlrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destr0yod the reseinblance of her future husband, he looked as if he djd riot vnderstand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bode her swear that she wauld never wed this monstcr, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014il seemed as if that voice again 6ade him remember his oath\u2014he turncd suddenly round, thinking Lord Rulhven wa\u017f near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who hod heord the whole, and thovghl this was but a return of his djsorder, entered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knoes to them, he implored, he begged of tbem t0 delay 6ut for oneday. They, attributirig this to tbe insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, cndeavoured t0 pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven hcld callod the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refusod witb euery one else. When he heard os Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but whenhe learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hard1y be concealed from thoso among whom he hcld gained this information. He hastoned lo the house of his former campanion, and, by constant attendance, and the protence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his pawer? His tongue had dangers and t0jls to recount\u2014could speak of himsolf as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on thecrowded earth, save with her to whom he addresfed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he kriew her, his existence, hcld begun to \u017feem worthy of preservation, if it were merely tbat he migbt listen to hor soothing accents;\u2014in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's clrt, or such was the will of fale, lhat he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch folling at Iength tohim, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which waf to take p1ace the very day before his departure for the eontinent.\nAubrey, wben be was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vajn. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; be wrote a letlcr to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued ber awn happiness, hcr own honour, and tbe honour of tbose now in lhe grave, who once beld her in their arms as t helr bapc and the hope of their house, to delay but sor a few hours that marriage, on which he denaunced the most heovy curscs. Theservants prornised lhey would deliver it; bvt giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Mifs Aubrey hy, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed 0n without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, witb a borror that may more ca\u017fily 6e conceivcd lhan described, the notesof busy preparation. Morning come, and the sovnd of carriages broke upori hif ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at 1ast ovcreame tbeir vigilance, they gradu ally stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old womon. He feized the opportunily, with onc bound was out of tbe room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he iinmediately approached, and, tclking his arm by force, hurried him from thc room, speeehless with rage. When an the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his oar\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, yourfisler is dishonoured. Wamen are frail!\" So saying, be pushed him towards his attendants, wbo, rou sed by the old waman, had come in scorch of him. Aubrey could no 1onger suppart hiinse1f; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentianed to his sister, wbo wos not present when he entered, as the physician was afraidof agitating her. The marriage was soleinriized, and the bride and brldegroom left Londan.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the esfusion of blood praduced symptorns of the near opproach of death. He desirod his sister's guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour hadflruck, he related eomposedly what the reader has perused\u2014he diedimmediately after.\nThe guardiclns bastened lo protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was toa late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all beforo him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his gulde.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of hls Maiesly's ve\u017fsels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beavty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetablcs always to be had thcre, induce rnany British vessels to vjsit it\u2014both men of war arid merchantmen; andthough it Iies rather out of the track sor shlps bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviatiori of a voyago. We landod; os usual, at tbebottom of the bay, and whilst the men werc employed in watering, and tbe purser bargaining for cattle with tbe natives, the clergyman and myself took a rainble lo the cave ca1lcd Homer's School, and other places, where wohad been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small montjcule sa named) we met with clnd engoged o yovng Greck as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me af a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose lo quitMitylene, where I am likely to get married. Ho was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, tbe winc-trader, six bundred zechincs for it, (about L250 Eriglish currency,) and haf resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he failf in his felucca very often to the differerit islands.\"\nThis account excited 0ur curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had rcsided. We wore kiridly received 6y an 0ld man,who coriducted us over the mansion. It confisled of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance ball, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet anncxed. They were al1 simply decoratcd: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle iri the centre, and a small founlain beneoth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a sprlng fixed in tho side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a lorge couch or sofcl completed tbe furniture. In the ha1l staod half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrorf, nor a single pointing. The bedcbamber had mcrely o large mattress spread on tbe floor, wlth two stuffed cotton quilts and a pil1ow\u2014the comrnon bed throughout Greece. In the siltirig-room we observed a marble recess, sormorly, the old mon told us, filled with bo0ks and papers,which wcre lhen in a large seaman's chesl in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining tbe contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Vo1ney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German languag e; Klopstook's Messlah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play af the Robbers; Milton's Paradi\u017fe Lost, an Italian edilion, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, muoh torn, but no Eriglish book of any description. Most of these books were filIed with marginal note\u017f, writlen with a pencll, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked wlth flips of paper, on which also were remark\u017f.\nThe old man faid: \"The lord had been reading these bookf lhe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"thero they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways uery g0od. I once did him a sorvlce; and I have the produec of this farm for thc trouble of toking care os it, except twenty zechines whioh I pay to an aged Armenlan who resides in asmall cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house extornally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fovrteen broad, and the fluted marblc pilIars witb black plinths and frct-work cornices, (as it is now cuslornary in Grecian architecturo,) were considerably higher thon the roof. The roaf, surrovnded by a light \u017ftone balvstrade, was c0vered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most os the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christl,\" eating fruit, arid enioying the evenjng breeze.\nOn the left hand af we eritered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were cIustering together on its borders, arid under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a rnarble seat with an omamental wooden back was plaeed, on which we were told, the lord possed many of his evenirigs and nighls till twelve 0'clock, reoding, writing, and talking to bimsolf. \"I suppose,\" said tbe ald man, \"praying\" f0r he wasvery devout,\"and always atterided our chureh twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe vlew from tbis seot was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CalcIa, covcred with olive and myrlle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic deoay. A smalI stream issuing from the ruins de\u017fcended in broken cascades, unti1 it was lost in the woods near thc mountain's base. The sca smootb as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed hy o fingle cloud, lermincltes the view in sront; and a little on the left, throvgh a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald greeri. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our cnquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had residod ln this romantic solitude: none knew his name bvt Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Cclndia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old fricnd?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time lo visit the Armenian, bul on our return to the town we learnt several particular\u017f of lhe isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with thom at the nupticll feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cottan and sllk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought o new boat for a si\u017fherman who had lost his own in a gclle, and he 0ften gave Greek Testamen ts to the poor children. In short, be appeared to us, frorn all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevo1cnt character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage lhought proper not t0 disolose. He had a most beautifvl daughter, with whom the lord wos often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her bimseIf the use of it.\nSuch was the information with wbich wc departed from the peaceful isle os Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who tbis rambler in Greece could be. He had inoney it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geriius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts wore dispelled.Fallirig in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arehitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeee, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whoin you are so anxlous, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedof, andI cllso visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of bis lordship's fame, as we had been some ycars from home; bul \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the reclvfe of Calcla in evory page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious iri our researcbes at the cottage, but weconsoIed ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene ori some future day; bvt to me that day will ncver returri. I make this statement, believlng it not quite uninterestlng, andin justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandercd. He has heen described as of cln unfeeling disposition, avcr se to associating with human nature, or conlributing inany way to sooth it\u017f s0rrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as moy be plainly gathered froin these llttle aneodotes. All lhe finer feeIings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have lheir seat in his basom.Tenderness, \u017fympathy, and charity appear loguide all his actions: and bis courtirig the repose of solitvde is an additional reason for marklng hjm as a being an whose heart Religion hatb set her seal, and over who\u017fe head Benevolence hatb thrown her mantle. Noman can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a rlght to give an opinion. Reports are euer to be received with caution, particu1arly wheri directed against man's moral integrity; arid he who dores ju\u017ftify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a felIow-mortal. Lord Byron's cbaracter is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun tho world's applause, is the surest teslimony of a virluous heclrt and sclf-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.","46":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded js very general in lhc East. Among the Arabians it appears tobe common: it did not,however, extend itself to the Greeksuntil after the estclbIishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present formsinco thedivision of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea 6ecoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, jl graducllly increased, clrid formed thc subject of many wondersu1 stories, still extanl, af the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and 6eavti fvl. In the West it \u017fpread, with same slight variation, all0ver Hungary, Poland, Austrio, and Lorraine, where the belies existed, thal vampyres nigblly imbibed a certain portion of tbe blood of thcir victims, who became emaciatcd, losl thoir strength,and speedlly died of consumpti0ns; whil\u017ft these human blood-suckers fattene d\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state os repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn lhe London Journal, of March, 1732, is o curious, and, af course, credible account of a particularcose of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madrcyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-ln-chies ondinagistrates of tho place, lbey posjtively and unanimou\u017fly affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been beard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way lo rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and ruhbing himself witb his blood. This preeaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre bimself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his deatb arid burial, mony persons complained of having beon tormented by him, and a deposition was inade, that four persons had been dcprived of life by his altacks. To preuent surther mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as js supposed to be vsual in oases of vampyrism) fresh, and enlirely free from corruptian, and omitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having beeri thvs obtoined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driuen eritirely tbrough the heart and bady of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have crled ovt as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, thcy cut 0ff his head, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses af those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, 6ecome agenls upon othors who survived them.\nThe universa1 belief ls, that a porson sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turri.\nCbief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, becaufe it seems better adapted to i1lustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for somo hejnous crimc committedwhilst in exi\u017ftence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compo1led to canfine his infernal vj\u017fitations solely to those bein gs he loved moft while upon earth\u2014tbose to whom he was bound by lies of kindred and affection.\u2014A supp0silion alluded to in the \"Giaou r.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre \u017fent, Thy corse fhall from its tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native pIace, And suck the blood of all tby race; There from thy daughter, sister, wise, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Sha1l knowthe demon for their sire; As cursing tbee, thou cursing them, Thy flowors are wjthered on the slem. But orie that far thy crime must fall, The youngest, besl beloved of alI, Shall bless thec with a father's name\u2014 Thot word shall wrap thy hoart in flame! Yet thou must end thy ta\u017fk and mark Her cheek's last tinge\u2014her eye's last spark, And the lasl glassy glance must uiew Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with vnhall0wed hand shall tear The tresses of ber yellow hair, Of which, iri Ilfe a lock when sharn Affection's fondesl pledge was worn\u2014 But now is horne away by thee Memorialof thine agony! Yet witb thine own best 6lood fhall drip; Thy griashing tooth, arid haggard lip; Then stalkirig to thy sullen grave, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in h0rror shririk away Fromspectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also iritroduced iri his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" lhe vampyre corse of the Arclbian maid Orieiza, wha is represented as havirig returned from the grave for lhe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to hclve resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being pourtrclyed thr0ughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long accourit in hi\u017f lravols of several astoriishirig ca\u017fes af vampyrisrn, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this svbject, besides a variety of anecdotef, and lraditionary narratives illustrat-\nive of its effects, has put forth some leamed dissertatioris, teriding to prove it to be a classioal, as well as barbarian error.\nMany eurious and interesting notices on lhis singularly horrible superstition inight be added; though the present may sufsice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be concludcd by mercly remclrking,that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, lhere are several others synonymous witb it, made use of in varjous partf of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Gou1, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the rnidsl of the difsipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the va rious parties of the loader\u017f os the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirtb around him, as lf he could n0t participate thereiri. Apparently, the light laughter of the sair only attracted his attentlon, that he might by a Iook quell it, and throw fear into those breast\u017f where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, sixing upon the object's sace, did not seem to penetrate, andat one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of thc hearl; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed vpon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities oaused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, ond those who had becn aocustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weighl of enn ui, were pleased at having something in thcir pre\u017fence capablc of engaging their attention. In spite of lhe dcodly hue of his faco, which riever gairied a warmer tint, either from the blvsh os modesty, or from the slrong emotion of passion, thovgh lts form and outline were beautiful, mclny of tho female hunters after notoriety attempted to wiri his cltlentions, and gain, at leclst, some marks os what they might term affection: Lady Mercor, who hod been the mockery 0f every monstcr shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriagc, thrcw herself in his way, arid did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract hif notice:\u2014thougb in vain:\u2014when fhe stood before hjm, though his cyes were apparently fixed upon hor's, still it \u017feemed os if they were unperceivod;\u2014everi hcr unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But thovgh the oornmon adultress could not jnfluence eventhe guidclnco of bis eyes, it was n0t that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he euer addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputcltion of a winning tonguo; and whetber it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that theywere inoved by his apparenl hatrcd of vlce, he was af often among those females who form the boast of their \u017fex fr0m lheir domestic virtues, as among those who \u017fully it by their vices.\nAbout the samo time, thcre camc t0Landon a young gentleman of the name os Aubrey:he was cln orphari left wilh an only sister in the possesslon of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in ehildhood. Left also to himsels by guardians, who th0vght it their duty merely to take care os his fortune, while they relinquished tbe mare important charge of his mind to tbe core of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more bis imagination than hif judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic fecling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentieos. He believcd all to sympathife with virtue, arid thought that vice was thrown in by Pravidenee merely for the picturesque effeel of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the miseryof a cottage merely consisted in tbe vesting ofclothes, which wero as warm, but whlch were better adapted to the pclinter's eye by their irregular solds and various colourod patches. He lhoughl, infine, tbat tho dreams of pocts were lhe realities of life. He wcls handsome, frank, and rich: for the\u017fe reasons, upon hi\u017f entering jnto the gay circles, inany mothers svrrovrided him, striving which shauld describe with loast truth their Ianguishjng or romping favourites: the daughters ot the same time, by thoir brlghtening countenclnces when he clpproacbed, and by their sparkljng eyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as be was to the romarice ofhi\u017f s0litary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thclt flickered, not from the prcfenoe of a ghost, 6ut from want of snuffing, there was no fovndation jn reaI life sor any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriplions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, bowever, some componsation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreamf, wheri the extraordinary being we have above descrihed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very imp0ssibllity of forming an idea of the character of a man enlirely absorhed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of external objeels, than the lacil assent to their existenco, imp1ied by the avoidance of lheir contact: allowing his imaginati on to pictvre every thing that flattered its propen\u017fity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this ohject irito the hero of a romanee, and determined lo observe the offfpring os his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that hjs presence was always recognised. He graduo1ly learnl thclt Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of prcparation in \u2014 Street, that he was abovt to travel. Desirous of gaining some informalion rospeeting this singular chclracter, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosily, he hinled to his guclrdians, that il was time for him to perform lhe tour, which for mclny generations haf been thought necesfary to enclble the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards pvtting themselvos upon an equality wjth the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if faIlen from the \u017fkies, whoneuer scandalous intrigues aro rnentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in earrying them on. They consented:and Aubrey immediately mentioning his jnteritions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to rcceive fram him a proposol lo ioin him. Flatterod by such a mark of esteem from him, wh0, apparently, had nothing ln common with other rnen, he gladly accepted it, and iri a few dayf they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Au brey hod bad no opportunity of studying Lord Rvthven's charoctor, andnow he fourid, lhat, though many more of his actians werc cxposod to his uiew, the results osfered different conclusions from the opparent motivesto his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberaIity;\u2014theidle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieue their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced toindigence hy the misfortvnes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\u2014these were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to a1low him to wallow in bis lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chclrity. This was, however, altributedby him to the greater importunlty of the vicious, which generally prevails over lhe retiring bashfvlness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumftarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still rnore improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, irievitobly found thot thero wos a curse upon it, for they were all either led to lhe scaffold, or sunk lo tho lowest arid the most abjecl misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at thc apparent eagerness with wbich his componion sougbt for the centres of al1 fashionable vlce; there he entered intoall the spirit of the foro table: he botled, and always gambled with suooess, except where lhe known sharper was his antagonlst, and then he lost even rnore than he gained; but it was alwayf with the same unchanging faee, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, \u017fo when he encountered the rash youthful navicc, or the luckless father of a numer0us family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law\u2014thi\u017f apparent abstractedness 0f mind wcls laid aside,and his eyes sparkled with inore firc than that ofthe cat whi1st dal1ying with the half-dead movse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent y0uth, torn from the circlehe adorned, cursing, in tbo solitudo of o dungeon, the fate thathad drawn him within the reach os this ficnd; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the spcaking laoks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of hjs lote immense wealth, wherewith to buy cuen sufficient to satjsfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling lable; but immcdiately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last giIder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result af a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey oftenwished to represent tbis to hif friend, and beg him to reslgn that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did riot tend to hisown profit;\u20146ut he delayed it\u2014for eoch day hc hopod his friend would give bim some opportunity of speakirig frankly and apenly to him; h0wevcr, this never occurred. Lord Ruthvon in his carriage, and amidst tbe various wild and rich fcenes of nature, was always the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratisication from it than the constclnt excltement os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaIted imagination began to assume tbe appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost \u017fight of his companion; he left him in daily atteridarice upon the morning circle of an Itcllian countess, whilst he went jn search of the memorials of another almosl dese-\nrted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eagor impatience; the first was sr0m hi\u017f sister, breathing nothlng but affection; the others werefrom his guardians, the latter astonished him; if il had before enterod into his imagination lhat there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give hlm sufficient reason for the beliof. His guardians insisled upon his iinmediately leaving his frjend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for tbat the possession of irrcsistible powers of feduction, rendered his liceritious habits more dangerous to sooiety. It had been discovored, that hjs contempt for the adultross had not originated in hatred af her character; but that hc had required, to enharice his gralifieation, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should 6e hurled srom the pinnclcle of unsullied virtuc, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femaIes wham he had s0ught, apparently on account of their virtue, hcld, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled lo expose the wh0le deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose ch aracter had n0t yet shown cl single bright poirit on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hiin altogether, purposing,in the mean wbiIe, to watch him more clofely, and to let no slight cjrcumstances pass by unnoticed. He enterod into the same circle, and soon pe rceived, that his Lordshjp was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whosehouse he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female i\u017f met with in society; he was thorefore obliged to carry on his plons in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon disc0uered that an assignation had been appoinled, which would most likely end jn the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no timo, he entered lhe apartinent of Lord Ruthven, and abruplly asked him his intentions with respect ta the lady, informing bim at the same time that he was aware of his beingab0ut to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thclt his intentlons were such cl\u017f he supposed all wou ld have vpon such cln occasion; and upon being pressed whether bo intended to marry her, merely laugbed. Aubrey retired; and, immedialely writing a nole, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of lheir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon thc mother af the lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard lo her dclughter, but also concerning the cbaracter of his Lordfhip. The assigriation was prevented. Lord Rulhven noxt day merely sent his seruclnt to notify his complete asserit to a sepclration; bvt did ri0t hlnt any susplcion of his plans hauing been foiled by Aubrey'f interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed hj\u017f steps loward\u017f Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon faund himself at Athenf. He then fixed his residonce in the house os a Greek; and soon occupjed himseIf in tracing the faded records of anoient g1ory upon monumerits tbatapparently, clshamed of chronicling the deeds of freomen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sbeltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wisbing to pourtray ori oanvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke to0 much mjnd for any one to think she could bclong ta those who had no sovls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle o poor lype of her bcauties; for wh0 wouId haue exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animclted nature, for lhat sleepy luxurious look os thc animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ian the often accompanled Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconsciovs girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttorfly, show the whole beauty of her form, f1oating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgat the letters he had just decyphered upon an almo\u017ft effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, os she slitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately bri1liant and swiftly fading hue\u017f, it might woll excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who Iet escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital imp0rtance to the propor iriterpretation of a passage in Pausanias. Bul why attempt to describeeharms which all feel, 6ut nono can appreciate?\u2014It was innocencc, youth, and heauty, unaffecled by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling 6alls. Whi1ft he drew those remains of whieh he wished topreserve a memorial for his future hours, she wovld stand by, and watch the magio effects of hif penoil, in tracing the scenes of her nativo place; she would then describe to him the circling dancc upon the open plain, would paint, la him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she rernembercd viewing ln her infancy; and then, turning to subjects thclt had evidently mode a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him aIl the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest oven of Aubrey; and often as fhe told him the tale of lhe livjng uampyre, who had passed yoars amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for tbe ensuing months, his blood would rvn eold, whi1st he attempted lo laugh her out os sucb idle and horrible fantclsies; but Iantbe cited to him the names of old meri, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the sl amp of the fiend's oppetite; and when she found hirn so incredu1ous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question thcir existence, always had some proof given, wbich o6liged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to eorifess it was true. She detailed to bim the traditional oppearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by bearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; ho, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there oould be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many eoincidences which had all tcnded to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthueri.\nAubrey began to attcl ch himself more arid more to Ianthe; her innooence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had soughtfor his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English babits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attclched to the almosl fairy form before hiin. He would tear himself at timesfrom her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wcls attained; but he alwayf found it imposslble to fix bis attention upon the ruins around him, whjlst in bis mind he retained an image that seemed olono lhe rightfulposses\u017for of bis thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscious of his love, and wcls ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seomed to part from him with reluctance; but it was becau\u017fe she had no longer any one with whom she could uisit her f avourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occvpicd in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She hadappealed to her parents on the subjeet of Vampyres, arid they both, with several present,affirmed their existence, pclle with horror at the very name. Soon clster, Aubrey determined to prooeed upon one of his excvrslons, wh ich was to detclin him for o few haurs; when they heard the naine of the p1ace, thcy all at once begged of bim nol to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek wauld ever remclin, after the day had closed, upon ariy consideration. They descrihed it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced tbe most hea vy evjls af impending upon him who dared to cross theirpath. Aubrey madc lighl of thelr representati0ns, and tried ta laugh them out of the idea; but when he \u017faw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superi0r,insernal powcr, the very name of which apparently made their hlood freeze, he was silenl.\nNext mornlng Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the rnelancholy face of his host, and wa\u017f coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible siends, had inspired them with such terror. Whenhc was ahout to depart, Ianthe came to the sido of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retvrn, ere njght allowed the power of thesc beings to be put iri action;\u2014he promi\u017fed. Ho was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would so0n end, and that in the borizon there was one of those specks whicb, in the warmer climates, so ropidly gathorinto a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage vpon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determinod ta make up by speed for his delay: but it was taolate. Twilight, in these southern cljmates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he hcld aduanced far, the power of the storm was above\u2014its ecboing thvnders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014ils thick heavy raln forced its way through the eanopying foliage,whilst lhe blue forked lightning soemed to fall and radiate at hif vcryfeet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he wascarried with dreadsul rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, hy the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourho0d of a hovol that hardlylifted itself up from thc masfes of dead leaves and brushw-\nood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approachod, hoping to find some one to guide him to the tawn, or at least tru\u017fting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, a1lowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling wilh the stifled, exullant mockery ofa laugh, contjnued in one almast unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: bul, roused by the thunderwbich again rol1ed over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut.He fovnd himself in utter darknes\u017f: the sound, however, guided him. Ho was apparently unporcelved; for, though hc called, still the sounds c0ntinued, and no notice was taken of him. He found bimself in contact with some one, whom be immediately seized; when a uoioe cried, \"Again baffIed!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seomed superhuman: determined to sell his lifo as dcarly as he eould, he struggled; but it was in valn:he was ljfted from his feel and hurlcd with enormovs force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw bimself upon hlm, and knee1ing upon hif breast, hcld placed bis hands upon his tbroat\u2014when the glclre of many torches penelrating tbrougb the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through lhe do0r, and in a moment tho crashlng of the branche\u017f, as he broke through lhe wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, iricapablc of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw wjtb heavy flakes of soal. At the desire of Auhrey they searched for her who had attracted bim by ber crie\u017f;he waf again left in dclrkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tho torchef once mare burst up0n him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoplng that it was but a vlsion arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, wben he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colovr upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet thero was a stil1ness about her face that seemod almost as attachjng as tbe life lhat once dwolt there:\u2014upon her neck clnd breost was blood, and upon her throat were lhe marks of teelh having opencd the vein:\u2014to this the men p0inted, crying, simultaneovsly struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A littcr was quickly formod, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had latoly heen to him thc object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fal len with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts werc\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refugo in vacanoy\u2014he held almast vnconsciausly in his hand a naked dagger of a partlcular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by differerit partios who had bcen engaged in the search ofber whom a molher had missed. Their lamentahle cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of soine dreadful catastrophe. \u2014Ta describe their grief would be impossible; hut when they ascertainod the cause oftheir child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolclble; both died broken-heartcd.\nAubreybeing put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was oflen delirious; in these intcrvals he wou1d oall upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by some unaccountable combination he feemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being ho loved. At other times he wouId imprecale malodictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destr0yer. Lord Ruthven, chanced al tbjs time to arrive at Athens, and, srom whatever motive, upon hearing of the stclte of Aubrey, immediately plclced himself in the same house, and became his canstant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, be was horrified and startled at the sigbt of him whose image he had now combined wlth that of a Vampyre; but Lard Rulbven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had cclused their separation, and still more by the attention, clnxiety, and oore w hich be showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathctic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as bis convalescence beganto be rclpid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived n0 differenoe fromthe former man, except that at times he wa\u017f surprised to meet bis gaze fixed interitly upon him, with a smile of maliciov\u017fexullation playing upon his lips: heknew not why, but this smile ha unted him. During the last floge of the irivcllid's recovery, Lord Rvthven was apparently engaged in wotching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progresf af tbose orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to auoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by thls shock, wos much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit wbich had once so distinguished him now seemed to hclve fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of salitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind cou1d not find it in the neighbov rhood of Athens; if he sought it amid\u017ft the ruiris he had former1y frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear waridering amidst the underwood, in q uesl of lho modest violel; then suddenly turniriground, w0uld show, to his wild irnagination, her pale face clnd wounded throat, with a meek smiIe vpon her lips. He determined to fly sccnes, every feature of which created such bitter associatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven,ta whom he held himself bound by the terider care he bad taken of him during his ilIness, lhat they should visit those parts of Greece ncilhor had yet seen. They trauelled in every diroclion, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: bvl though tbey thvs hclstened from plaee to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to sligbt these reports, which they imagined wero only the invention of iridjvidvals, whose interest it was to excite the generosjty of those whom they dcfended from pretendcd dangers. In consequence os thus ne glecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled wilh only a few guards, more to serve cls guides than as a defence. Upon entoring, however, a narrow dofile, at tbe bottom of wbicb was the bed of a torrent, with large mas\u017fes of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they hod reasonto repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of lhe party engaged in the narrow pass, when they werestartled by tho whistling of bullets close to thoir heads, and by the echoed report 0f sev-\neral guns. In an jnstclnt their guards bad left them, and, placing themsclves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report camo. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, iinitating their example, retired for a momenl behind the she1tering lurn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts badethem advance, and being exposed to urireslsting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they delermined at onceto rush forwclrd in search of the enemy. Hard1y had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in thc sboulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, na longcr heeding the contest or his own pcril, was soon surprised by seeing thc robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthveri's being wounded, jmmediatcly thrown up thejr arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and baving agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being conterit merely togvard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two day\u017f morlisicatjon ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the ohjects ahout him: but towards the close 0f the last evening, his mind became apparentIy uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubroy, who wof induced to offcr his assj\u017ftance with more than usval eornestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean nat my life, I heed the death af my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I w0uld do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.\u2014\"I necd but little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I cannot cxplain the whole\u2014but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world'\u017f mouth\u2014and if my death were unkno wn for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014bul lise.\"\u2014\"It shall not be kriown.\"\u2014\"Swcar!\" cried the dying man, raising himsels wilh exultant violence, \"Swear by al1 your s0ul revores, by all your nature fears, swear thal, sor a year and a day you wiIl not impart your knowledge os my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever rnay happeri, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from tbeir sockets: \"I sweor!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retlred to rest, but did not s1eep; tbe many circumstances altending his acquaintanee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew nol why; when he remembcred hi\u017f oath a cold shivcring came over bim, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to enlcr the houel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber methim, and informed him that it was no loriger there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon hi\u017f retiririg, to the pinriacle of a neighbourlng mount, aecording to a promise they had givenhis lordship, that it should be exposod to the first cold ray of the inoan that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking severaI of the men, determiried to go and bury it upon the spot whore it lay. But, when be hcld mounted to the suminit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothos, though the robbers swore lhey pointed out the identical rock on which tbey had laid the body. For a tjme his mind was bewildercd in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpsc for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a cauntry in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid in wbich all apparently conspircd to heigblen tbat superstitious melancholy thal had seized upon his mind, he resolvcd to leave it, and soon arriued at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Napl es, he occupied himseIf in arranging those effects he had with him bol0riging to Lord Rulhven. Amongft other things there was a case containing several weapori\u017f of offence, more or less adapted l0 ensure the death of the victim. Thcre were severaI daggers and atagharis. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forins, what was his surprise at findjng o sheath apparently ornamerited in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddered\u2014hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and bi\u017f horror may be imagined when he discoverod that it fitted, though peculiarIy shaped, theshoalh he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no furlher certainty\u2014thcy seemed gozing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbeljeve; but the particular form, the \u017fame varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and lcft n0 room for doubl; there were als0 drops of blaod on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and ori his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concern ing the lody he had attempted to snatch from Lard Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parenls were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heclrd of since the depclrture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almosl broken under so mariy repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyerof Iant ho. He became morose and silent; and his only oocupation consisted in urging the speed of the postjlions, af if he were going to savc the life of some one he held dear. He arrived al Calais; a breoze, whieh seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hiin to the Englisb shores; and he hastened to the mansion 0f his fathers, and there, for a moment,appeared to lose, in lhe embraces and earcsses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that tbe woman beganto appear, she was still more altaching as a compariiori.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of lhc drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists ln the heatcd atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneatb. Tbere was a melancboly charm abaut it which did not secm to arise from misfortunc, but from soine feeling withln, that appearod t0indioate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was nol that light footing, whicb stray\u017fwhere'er a butterfly or a colour moyattract\u2014lt was sedate ond pensive. When alone, her sace was nevcr brightened by the smile of joy;bvt when her brother breclthed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget lhose griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchongedher smile for that of the uoluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014t hat faoe were theri playing in tbe light os their own native sphere. She waf yet only eighteen, and had not heen presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return froin lhe continent, when he might be her prote ctor. It was now, thercfore, resolved thclt the next drawing-room, whieh was fast approaching, should be the epooh of her entry into the \"busy scene.\"Aubrey would rother have remajned in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which 0verpowered him. He cou Id not feelinterest about the friualities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; bul he determined to sacrifiee his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in town, andpropared for the next day, wblch had been arinounced as a drawing-room.\nTbe crowd was excessivo\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and a1l who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whjle he was stclnding in a corner by himself, heodless of all around him, cngaged in lhe remembrance thot the first lime he had \u017feen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\u2014be felt himself suddenly \u017feized by the arm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly caurage to turn, fearful of seeing o spectre that would blasl him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his nolice an this spot upon his first entry into soci-\nety. He gazed till his limbs almast refusing ta bear their weig-\nht, he was obliged to take tho arm of a friond, and forcing a passage throu gh the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and wa\u017f driven home. He paced the room with hurricd steps, and fixed his hands vpon his head, as if he were afraid hjs thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rvthven again before him\u2014circumstances started up in dreadfuI array\u2014the dagger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused hjmself, he oould riot belleve it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He thought his imagination bad conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossihle that it could be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to g0 again intosaciety; for thougb he attemptcd to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the nclme hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gairiirig information. He went a few nights after wlth hif sister to the clssembly of a near relation. Leaving her under tbe protection of a matron, he retired into a rocess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring th0ughts. Perceivjng, at last, thatmany were leaving, he r0used himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by seueral, apparently in earnest convcrsation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reuealed to him those fecltures he maft abharred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, sorced her towards the ftre-\net: al the door he found bimself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wailing for their lords; and while he was engaged in pclssing them, he clgairi heard tbat voioe whisper close to him\u2014\"Remember your aath!\"\u2014He did not dare to turn, 6ut, burrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distractcd. If before his mlnd had been absorbed by one subjecl, how much more completely was it engrossed, n0w that tho certainty of the monster's living again presfed upon his thoughts. Hi\u017f sister'\u017f attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vaintbat she intreated him to exp1ain to her what had cavsed his abrupt ooriduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thougbt, the more hc was bewildered. His oatb startled him;\u2014was he lhen to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruln upon his breath, amidst all he heId dear, clnd not averl its progress? His very sister mighl have been touched by him. But euen if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of emp1oying his own hand to free lhe world from such a wretch; but death, he romembered, had been already mocked. For days he reinained in this state; shut up in hjs r0om, he saw no one, and ate only whenhis sister carne, who, witb eyos streaming with tears, besoughthim, for her fake, lo support nature. At la\u017ft, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed srom street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-doy svn as t0 the inidnight darnp s. He was no l0nger to be recogni zed; at firft hc retvrned with the evenirig to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherevor fatigue overtook him. Hjs sister, anxious for his \u017fafely, omployed poople to fol1ow him; but they wero soon djstanced by hlm who fled from a pursuer \u017fwlfter than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absenee lhe whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined t0 enter again into society, and watch him closoly, arixious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intjmacy. But when he enlered into a room, hjs hclggclrd and \u017fuspicious looks werc so strjking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to ahstain from sceking, for her sake, a society which affecled him so strongly. Whcn, however, remonstrance provod unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, clnd, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thougbl it high time to resu me again that trust wblch had been before jmposed upon them by Aubrey's parentf.\nDesirous of saving hiin from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing bim from exposing to the general eye lhose marks of what they corisidcred folly, they engoged a physician ta resjde in thc house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mirid absorbed by one terrlble subject. Hi\u017f incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. Tbere he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayeditself upon tho entry 0f his sister; then he would sometimef start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely aff1icted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014is your Iove for me is aught, do not go near him!\" Wheri, however, she inquired to whom he referrcd, his only clnswer was, \"True! lruo!\" and a gain he sank into a slate, whence n0t even she c0uld rouse him. This losted many months: gradvally, however, as the year was passing, his incoherenccs becamo less frequent, and hi\u017f mind threw off a portion ofits gloom, whilft his guardians ohserved, that several time\u017f in the doy he would count upon his finger\u017f a definite n umber, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wheri, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse witb his physiclan upon tbe melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was gojng next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention wos ottracted; he afked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of wbieh they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned thc name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he hod mel wilh in society, Aubrey seemcd pleascd, and astonished thein still more by his expresfing his lntention to be present at tbe nuptials, and desiririg to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minute\u017f his sister was with him. He was apparently agoin capable of being affected hy the influence of ber lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breosl, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the thought of her brather's being once more ali ve to the fee1ings of affection. He began to speak with all hjs wonted warmth, and to cangratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distingulshed for rank and every clccomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a l0cket upon her breast; openirig il, whal was hif surprise at heholding the features of the monster wha had so long influenced hls life. He seized the portrail in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under fo0t. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resomblarice of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014thon seizi rig her honds, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of eounleriance, he bade her swear thal she would never wed this mon\u017fter, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seeined as if that voice again bade hirn remember his oath\u2014he turnod \u017fuddonly round, thinking Lard Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thaught thif was but a relurn of his disorder, entered, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, dcsired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees ta them, be imp1ored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attribvtirig this to the insanitythey imaginod had taken possesslon of his mind,endeavoured to pacify him,and retired.\nLord Ruthven had ealled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Whon he heard os Aubrey's ill hcaIth, he readily understood hirnself to 6e the cause 0f lt; butwhen he learncd that he was deemed insane, hls exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed frarn those among whom he had gained tbis informatian. He hastened to the bouse of hls former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenee of great affection for the brother and interest in hif fato, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who eovld resist his power? His tongve had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual bavirig no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew hor, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were inerely that he might listen to her soolhing aocents;\u2014jn sine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's arl, or sucb was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. Tbe litle of the elder 6ranch falling at lerigth to him, he obtained an important emhassy, whieh served as an excuse for hasteriing the marriage, (in spite of her brother's derariged state,) which was to take place the very day before hif departure for tbe continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by thephysician ond his guardiaris, attempted to brihethe servants, but in vain. He a\u017fked for pen and popor; jt was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiriesf, her own honour, and the honaur os those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their bope and the hope of their house, to delay bvt sor a sew hours that marriage, on which he denounced the mofl heavy curfes. The servarils promised they would de1iver it; but giving il to the physician, he thought it better not to har ass any more the mind of Miss Aubrcy by, what he considercd, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the bvsy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horr or that may more oasily be conceived thande\u017fcribed, tbe notes of busy preparation. Morning came, clnd the sourid of carriages broke upon bis ear. Aubrey grew almostfrantic. The curiosity of thc servants at last ovcrcome their vigilance, they gradually sloIe away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless 0ld woman. He seized the opporturiity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a momcnt found himself in the apartment where all were nearlyasscmbled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hjm: he immediately approached, and, taking hif arm by forco, hur ried him from the roam, speechIess with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered jn his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brjde to day, your fister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So sayirig, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by lhe old w0man, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer suppart himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the phy\u017fician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness iricreased; the effusion os blood produced symptoms of the near approa ch of death. He de\u017fired his sister's guardiaris might be called, ond when the mjdnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\u2014ho died immedlatoly after.\nThc guardians bastened to proteet Mi\u017fs Aubrey; but when they clrrlved, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OFA LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailjng through thc Grecian Arohipelago, on board oneof bis Majesty's vesself, ln the year 1812, we pvt into lhe harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name.The 6eautyof lhis place, and the certain supply ofcattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Brjtish vessel\u017f to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and tbough it lies rothor 0ut of the traok for ships baund to Smyrna, its bounties clmply repay sor the devicltian of a voyage. We landed; as usual, ot the bottom of the bay, and whi1st the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattlo with the natjves, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave ca1led Homer's School, and other places, where we had been beforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticuleso named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our gvide, wbo told us he had come from Sci0 with an English lard, who left the i\u017fland four doys previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" faid the Greek, \"and wovld have taken me with him; bvt I did nat choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to gel married. He was an odd, but a very go0d man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belong\u017f to him, and he has left an old man in ohclrge of it: be gave Dominick, the wine-trader, fix hundred zechine\u017f for it, (about L250 English currency,) arid has resided there about fourteen months, tbovgh not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account exeited our euriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had residod. We were kindly received by an old man, wha conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of fovr apartments on the ground-floar\u2014an entronce hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-roorn, with a spacious closet anriexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grcen-ftained walls, marble tables on eitber side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a sma1l hronze Venus iri a loaning posture; a largo couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bo0k-case: thcre were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamher had merely a largo mattress spread ori the floar, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pillow\u2014the common hed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observeda inarble reeess, formerly, the old man told uf, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closct: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining lhe conterits. On the tahlet 0f the recess lay VoItaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roussoau's works eomplete; Volncy's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller'splay of thc Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Lo\u017ft, an Italion edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and morked with slipf of paper, on which also were reinarks.\nThe old mcln said: \"The lord had been reading tbese books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his rcturn; forhe is so particular, lhat were I to move one thing withovt orders, hc would frown upon me for a week together; he lsotherways very good. I once did him a service; clnd I haue the produce of this fclrm for the trovble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenianwho resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe oppearance of the house externally wa\u017f pleasing. The porlico in front wa\u017f fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the slvted marble piIlars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. Thc roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrclde, was covered by a firie Turkey oarpet, beneatb an awning of strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus furnjshed, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking Iigbt wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided awoy, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we wcre lold, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights tjll twelve o'c1oek, reading, writjng, and lalking to bimseIf. \"I svpposc,\" said the old mon, \"praylng\" for he was very devout, \"and cl1ways attendod our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nTheview from tbis seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle lroes iri bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended iri broken cascades, until it was lost inthe woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth os glass, and an h0rizan unsbcldawed by a single cloud, terminates the uiew in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several sinall islands were distinctly observed, stvdding the 1ighl blue wave with spots of em erald green. I seld0m enjoyed a view mare thon I djd this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the namc of the persan who had resided in tbis romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"\u2014\"And carinot yov tell, old frierid?\" said I\u2014\"If I can,\" sclid he, \"I daro not.\" We had not time to vi\u017fit the Armenian, bul on our return to the town we learnt seueral particulars of the isoIated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he wa\u017f last upon the island, and even dariced wilh them at the nuptial feast. He gove a cow to one inan, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who ljve by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own ln a gale, and he oftcn gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and bcnevolent charocter. Drie circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not t0 difcloso. He had a most beoutiful daughtor, with whom the lord was often secn walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himse1f the use of it.\nSuch wcls the lnformation witb which we departed from the peaoeful isle of Mitylene; our jmaginations all on the rack, guessirig who this rambler in Greece covld be. He had money it was evidenl: he had philarithropy of dispasitiori, and all tbose eccentricities whicb mark peculiar gonius. Arrived at Palermo, all our d0ubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect,a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travellingin Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, js Lord Byron; I met himin my travel\u017f on tho island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylerie.\" We had never then heard of his lordshlp's fame, af we hod been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put jnto our hands we recognized thc recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret riot hclving been more c urious in our researches al the cottage, but we consoled ourselues wlth the idea of returning to Mitylone on some future day; but to me that day wilI never relurn.I make this statement, believing it not quite unintercsting, and in ju\u017ftice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slaridered. He has been desoribed os os an unfeelingdisposition, averse to asso-\nciatirig with human nature, or contributing in any way to footh its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly tho reverse, as may bo ploinly gathered fram tbese little anecdotes. All tho finer fcelings of lhc heart, so eleganlly depicted in his lordship's poems, scem to have their seat in his bosoin. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guidc all his aetions: arid his courting the reposo of solitude is an additional reason sor marking hirn as a boing on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, clnd over whose head Benevolenoe hath thrown her montle. No rnan con read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right ta give an opinlon. Rep0rts are ever to be received with cautiori, parlicularly when directed agai nst man's mora1 integrity; and he who dare\u017f juslify himself before that awful tribunal where oll mu\u017ft appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his geniu s. Ta do good in secret, and shuri thc world's applau\u017fe, if the surest testimony of a virtuous heartand self-clpproving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-covrt, F1cet-street.","47":"THE VAMPYRE;\nA Talc.\nBy Jahn Willlam Polldori\nTHE superstition upon wbich this tale is founded is very generalin the Ea\u017ft. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, howover, extend ilself to the Greeks unlil aster the establishment os Christianity; and it has only asfumed its prcsent forin since the division os the Latin and Greek ehurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that o Latin body could not corrupl if buried in their territory, it gradually lncroa\u017fed, and forrned the subject of many wonderful storios, still extarit, of the dead rising from their graues, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the Wost it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrcline, where tbe belief exi\u017fted, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of lhe bloodof thelr victims, who became emaciated, lost thoir strength, and spcedily died of consumplions; whilft these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veiris became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause lhe 6lood ta f1ow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal, of March, I732, is a curious, and, of covrsc, credible account of a particu1clr case of vampyrlsm, which is stated to hove occurred at Madreyga, inHungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positivcly and unanimously affirmed, th at, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, nclined Amold Poul, had been heard to say, thclt, clt Cassavia, on the frontlers of the Turki\u017fh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himse1f 0f the evil, by eating some of the earth ovt of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing bimself witb his blood. This precaution, however, did not preverit bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days astor his death and burial, many persons complained of having been t0rmented by him, and a deposition was mado, that four persons had beeri depriued of life by his attacks. To prevent furtber mischief, lhe inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is \u017fupposed t0 be u\u017fval in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitling at the mouth, nose, and oars, pure and florid blood. Praos having been thus ohtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A slakc was driven entirely lhrough the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which be is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. Thls done, they cut osf his head,burned his body, and threw lhe ashes into his graue. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons wha had previously died from vampyrism, lcst they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived thern.\nTbo universal beliof is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hirnself, and svcks in his turn.\nChief baili-\nff.\nThis monstrou\u017f rodomontade is here reloted, beeause it seems better adapted to illustrate lbe subject af the present obscrvations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is oonsidered as a sort of punishment aftor death, for some heinous crlme commjtted whilst in existence, thal the deceased is not on1y do0med to vampyrise, but compelled lo confino his infernal visitatjons \u017folely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom hewas bound by ties os kindred and affectjon.\u2014A svpposition alluded toin the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from it\u017f tom6 be rent; Then ghaslly baunt the native place, And suck the blood ofclll thy race; There from thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loatho the bariquet which perforce Must feed tby liuid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for thcir sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flawers are withered on the stem. But one that sor tby crime must fclll, The youngest, hesl beloved of alI, Shall bless thce with a sather's name\u2014 That word shall wrclp thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her choek's last tingc\u2014ber eye's last spark, And the last glo\u017fsy glonce must view Which froezes o'er its lifeless blue; Thori with urihallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in llfe o lock wbcri sh0rn Affection's fondeft pIedge was wom\u2014 But now is borrie away by thee Memorial of thino agony! Yet with lhineowri best hlood shall drip; Thy gnashlng tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grclve, Go\u2014and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these iri horror shririk away From spectro more accursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in hi\u017f wild but heautiful poem of \"Thclloba,\" the vampyre corsc of the Arabian maid Oneiza, whoi\u017f represenled as having relurned srom the grave for lhe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But tbis connot be svpposed to have resulted from the sinfulnoss of her life, she being pourtroycd throvghout the whole os the tale as a eompletc typo of purity and innocence. The verocious Tournefort gives a long account in hif travels of sevoral astonishing cases of vampyrism, to whjcb he pretendf to hove been an eyewjtness; and CaImet, in his great work upon this subjcct, besides a variely of anecdoles, and traditionory narratives illvstrative of its efseets, has put forth some learned dissertatlons, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well os barbarian error.\nMany cvriou\u017f and interesting notices on tbis singularly horrib1e superstjtion might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits 0f a riote, neces\u017farily devoled to explanalion, clnd which may now bo concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in inost generaI acceptation, there are several otbers synonymous with it, made use of in variou\u017f parts of the warld: as Vraucoloeha, Vardoulacha, GouI, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midstof the di\u017fsipations attendant upon a London wiriter, there appeared at the vari ous pclrties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularlties, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparcntly, the light laugbter of the sair only attracted his attontion, that he mlght by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensatiori of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deod grey eye, whlch, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward workings of tbe heort; hut fell upon the cheek with a leaden roy thcll weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculioritios caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to seo him, and those who had been accuslomed to violent oxcitemerit, and now selt lhe weighl of ennui, wore pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging tholr attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tirit, eithor srom the blush of modesty, or from tbe strong emotion of pass ion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many 0s the female hunters after notori ety attempted to win his attentions, and galn, at loast, fome marks of what they mlght term affection: Lady Mercer, who badbeen lbe mockery ofevery monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notioe:\u2014though in uain:\u2014when sbe stood besore him, though his eyes wero apparently fixedupon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;\u2014even her unappalled impvdence was baffled, and she lefl the field. But though the common adultress covId not influence everi the guidanco of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was jndifferent to him: yet such was the apparent oaution with wbicb he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew hc ever oddrossed himseIf to females. Ho had, bowever, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was thal it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that thoy were moved by his apparent hatred ofvice, he was as often among tho fe females who form tbe boast of their \u017fex srom their domestic virtues, as am ong those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: hewas an orphan lefl with an 0rily sister in the possession of greal wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Lefl also t0 himsels by guardians, who thovgbt it thelr duty merely to take care of his fortune, while theyrelinquished the more important cbarge of his mlnd to the care of meroenary subalterns, he cultivated more hi\u017f imagination than his judgment. He had, h ence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, whicb daily ruins so many milIiners' apprentices. He beIieved all to sympothise with virtue, and thought tbat vice was thrown ln by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scenc, cls we see in romances: he thought that the inisery ofa cottage merely consisted in the vesting of c1othes, which were as warm, bvt which were betteradapted to the painter's eye by thejr irregular folds and vari0us coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the roaIities of lifo. He waf handsome, frank, and rich: for lhese reasons, upon his entcring int0 tbe gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whicb should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances wheri he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened hi\u017f lips, soan led him into false nolions os his talcnts and his merit. Attacbed as he was to the romance of his solitary haurs, he was startIed at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presenoe of a ghosl, but from wclnt of snuffing, there was no foundation in reaI life for any 0f thal congeries of pleosing pictures and descriptions contained iri those volumes, from which he had formed his stvdy. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratlfied vanily, he was about torelinquish bis dreams, when the extraordinary being we have obove described, crosscd him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very imposslbllity of forming an idea of the charaeter of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assont to their existencc, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hls imoginati0n to piclure every thing that flattered ils prapensity ta extrclvagant ideas, he soon formed this objectinto the hero of a romance, and determined t0 obscrve the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted wjth him, paid him attentions, and so far aduanced upon his notice, that hi\u017f preferico was always recognised. He gradually lea rnt that Lord Ruthven's offairs were embarrassed, and soon f0und, srom the nates of preparation in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desir ovs of gaining \u017fomo information respeotlng this singular character, wh0, ti1l now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hintedto hif guardians, lhat it was time for him to per f0rm the tour, whjch for many generatioris has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the careor of vice towards puttingthemselves upori an equality wjlh the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skjes, whenever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of plea\u017fontry or of praise, aecording to the degree af skill shewn in carryirig them on. Tbey consented: and Aubrey immediately mcntioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join bim. Flattered by sueh a mclrk of esteem from him, who, apparently, had n0thlng in oomman with other men, he gladly accepted it, and iri a few days they had passed the circling walors.\nHilherta, Aubrey bad had no opporlunity of ftudying Lord Rulhven's character, and now he found, that, thovgh many more of his aetions were exposed to hisuiew, the results offered different coriclusions from the apparent motivef lo his condvct. Hi\u017f companiori was profuse in his liherolity;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and tbe beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upori the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon uirtuc, that he 6estowed his alms;\u2014these were sent from the door witb hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to a\u017fk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, ar ta sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was fent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, whjch gcnerally p revails over the retirlng hasbfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was orie circumstance about tbe charity of his Lordship, which was sti1l more impressed upon hls mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that lhere was a ourse upon jt, for thoy were all eithcr led to the scafsold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject rnjsery.At Brussels and other towns through whicb they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparenl eagerriess with which bis companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he losl even mare than hc gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watcbed the society around: it was not, bowever, so when he encountered the rash youlhfvl novice, or lhe luckless father of a numcrous family; theri his uory wish seemed fartune's law\u2014this appclrent obstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilsl dclllying with the balf-deod mouse. In every town, he left the formerIy affluent youth, torn from the cirole he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a fatber sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry ohildren, without a singIe farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to 6uy even sufficlent to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no moncy from tbe gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of m any, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain de gree 0f knowledge, which was nol, however, capable af combclting the ovnning of the moreexperienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, arid beg him to resign lhat charity and pleasvre which proved the ruin of oll, and did not tend to his own profit;\u2014bvt be delayed it\u2014for each day he hoped his friend would giue hirn somc opportunily of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occvrred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amldst the uarlous wild and rich sceries ofnature, was always the same: his eye fpoke less tban his lip; and though Aubrey was near lhe ohject of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the canstant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystory, which ta his exalted imagination began to assume the appearancc of somethirig supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at R0rne, and Aubrey for a lime lost sight af his companion; he left him in dailyatlondanee upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoriaIs of another almost dcserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived fromEngland, which be opened with eager impat-\nienee; the first wa\u017f from his sister, breathing riothing but affection; the 0thers were from his guardians, thc latter astonished him; if it had before enlered into his imclgination that there was an evil power resldent in his companion, these seemed to give him suffioient reafon for thebellef. His guardiaris insisted upon his imrnediately leavlng his sriend, and urgcd, that his character wcls dreadfully vici0us, for that the possession os jrresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious hahits inore dangerous to soeiety. Il bad been discovered, that his contempt for the adullress had riot ariginated in hatred of bor chclracter; but that he had required, to cnhance hjs gratification, that his vlctlm, the partner of his gullt, \u017fbould he hurled from the pinnac1e of unsullicd virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infclmy and degradalion: in fine, that all tbo\u017fe fcmales wbom he had sought, apparently on account af their virtue, had, since bis departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determiried upon leaving one, whose character hcld not yet shown a single bright polnt on which to rest the eye. He resolved lo invcnt some plausibIe pretext far abandoning him altagethcr, purposing, ln tbe mean while, to wcltch him more closely, and to let no slight circvmstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, and \u017foon pereeived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon lhe inexperience of the daughter of the lady wbose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is soldom that an vnmarried female is met with in saciety; he was therefore o6liged to carry on his plans in secret; bulAubrey's eye followed him in all his windlngs, and soon discovered that an assignation bad been oppointed, which would most likely end ln the ruin of an innocent,though thoughtless girl. Losing no time,he ontered the apartment of LordRuthven, and abruplly asked him his intentlons with respect to the lady, informing him at the some lime that he was aware ofhjs being clbout to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answored, that his intentions were such cls he supposed all w0uld have upori such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laugbed. Aubrey retired; and, immed-\niately writing a nole, to say, that from that mament he muft decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho mother of the lady, informed her os all he kriew, nat only with regclrd to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was preventod. Lord Ruthven next day merely serit his seruant to notjfy bis complete assent to a separalion; but did not hinl clny suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving Ieft Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Poninsvla, soon found himself at Athens. He thcn fixed his residencc in the house os a Greek; and saon occupied himself in lracing the faded records of aneient glory upon monumerits tbat apparently, ashamedof chronicling the deeds of freemen anly before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many c0loured lichen. Under the same roof as him\u017felf, existed a being, fo beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model fora painter wishing to pourtray on canuass the promised hope of the falthful in Mahomel's parodise, save tbat her eyes spake too much mind for any one to think sho oould belong to those wha had no souls. A\u017f she danced upon thcplain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would bave thought tbe gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, forthat sleepy 1uxurious look oflhe clnima1 suited but to tbe tasle of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompa-\nnied Aubrey in his search after antiquilics, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show tho whole beauty of her farm, floating as it wore upon the wirid, to the eager gazc of him, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered upan an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of hcr sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in lhe sun's ray such delicatelybrilliant and swiftly fclding hves, it mighl well excusethe forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escclpe frorn his mind lbe vory object he had before thaught of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pau\u017fanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocerice, youth, and heauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and \u017ftifllng balls. Whllst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a mcmarial for his future hours, she wovld stand by, arid watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing thescerie\u017f of ber nativeplace; \u017fhe w0uld then deseribe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, ta him in all the glowing colours of youthfvl memary, the marriage pamp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning tosvbjects that had evidently made a greater jmpression upon her mind, wovld tell him aIl the supernatural tale\u017f of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interesl even of Aubrey; arid often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of cl lovely female to prolong his existonce sor the ensuing month\u017f, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such ldIe and horrible fanla\u017fies; but Iantbe clted t0 him the names of old men, who had at last detectcd one Iiving among themselves, after several of tholr near relatives clnd children bad been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulovs, she begged of him to believe her, for it bad been, remarked, that those who had dared toquestion their existerice, always had some proof givon, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his harror wcls increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description af Lord Rulhven; he, however, stiIl persisted in persuading her, that lhere could be no truth in hor fears, lh0ugh at the saine time he wondered al the many coincjderices which had all tended to excile a belief in lbe fupernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began t0 attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted wilh all the affecled virtues 0f the womeri among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his hearl; and while he ridiculed the idea of a yourig man of English habits, marryjng an uneducated Greek girl, stjlI he found himsclf more and morc attached to the almoft fajry sorm before him. He wauld tear hi mself at times from her, and, forming a p1an for some antiquarian research, he would depart, deterrnincd not to return until his object was attained; but he alwayf found it impossjble to fix his attentiori upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seeined alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile heing he had first known. Sbe cll waysseemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was boca use fhe had no loriger any one with whom she could visil her favourite haunts, wbilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncoveririg some fragment which had yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. She had appealcd to her parents on the subjcct of Vampyres, and they bolh, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror al the very naine. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon ono of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when tbey heard the name0f the place, thoy all at once beggod of him notto return at night, as he must necessarily pass througb a wood, where no Greek wovld over remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending vpon him who dared to crass their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of tbe idea; bul when he saw them shuddcr at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext mornlng Au brey set off upon his excursion uncltterided; he was surprised to abser ve the melanch0ly face of hi\u017f hosl, and was concerried to find that his words, mocking tbe belief of those horrible fiends, had lnspired them with such terror. When he was abaut to depart, Ianthe came to thc slde of his horse, and eamestly begged oshim to return, ere night allowed tho power of these beirigs tobe put in action;\u2014hc promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceivo that day-light would soon end, and that in thehorizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, \u017fo rapidly gclther inlo a tremend0vs ma\u017fs, and pour all tbeir rage upon the devated country.\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by spoed for his delay: but it was too lale. Twilight, in thcse southern cliinates, is a1most unknown; immediately the sun sets, nig ht begins: and ore ho had advanced far, thepower of the storm was clbovo\u2014ils echoirig tbunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest\u2014lts thick beavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked ljghtning seemed to faIl and radiate at his very feot. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreodful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animol at last, through faligue, stopped, and he found, by tbe glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifled ilself up from the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood which surr0unded it. Dismounting, he approached, hopirig to find some one to guide him to thc town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter srom the pelting of the storm. A\u017f he opproached, the thunders, for a moment silent, ollowed him to hear the drcadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultclnt mockery of a laugh, continued in orie almosl uribroken sound;\u2014he wasstartIed: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced opcn the door os the hut. He found hirnself in utter darkness: the sound, howeuer, guided him. He waf clpparently unperceived; for, though he ca1led, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himseIf in eontact with some one, whom hc immediately seized; wben a v oice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strcngth seemed \u017fuperhuman: determined to soll his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was iri vain: he was lifted from bis fect and hurledwith enormaus force against the ground:\u2014his encmy threw himself upan him, and kneeling upan his breast, had placed his hclnds upon his throclt\u2014wheri lhe glare of many torches penetrating tbrough the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\u2014he instaritly rose, and, leauing his prey, rushed lhrough the door, and jn a moment the crclshing os the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no langer heard. The storm was naw still; and Aubrey, incapable of movlng, was soori heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thalch loadedon every individual straw with heavy flakos of soot. At the desirc of Aubrey they seclrched for her who had attracted him by her ories; he waf again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchcs once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair c0nductress brought iri a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it wa\u017f but a vision arising from his dislurbed jmclgination;but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretchod by hls fide. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about hcr face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her thraat were the marks of teethhaving opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crylng, \u017fimultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litterwas quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of hor who had lately been to him the objecl of so many bright and foiry visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died wilhin her. He knew not what his thoughts wero\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemod to shuri refloction, and take refuge in vacancy\u2014he held almost uncon\u017fciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which bad been found iri the hut. Thoy were soon met by differerit parties who hadbeen engaged in the seclrch of ber wbom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, af they approachedthe eity, forewarried the parents of some d readful catastrophe. \u2014To describc their grief would be impossible; bvt when they ascerlairied the cause os their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, ond pointed to the corse. They were incon\u017fola61e; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed wos seized wilh cl most violent fever, ond was often deliriaus; in these intorvals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\u2014by saine unaccouritable combination ho seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledietions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, srom whatever rnotive, upon hearing os the \u017ftate of Aubrey, immedialely placed himself in the same houfe, and became his constant attendant. Wheri the latter recovered from bis delirium, he was horrified and start1ed at the sight os him whose image hehad now combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, iinplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and stiIl more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled hlm to bis presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appearod thot apathetic being who had so astanished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence bcgan to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former mon, except that at times he wa\u017f surprised to meot his gaze fixcd intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation p1aying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Rvthvenwas apparently engaged in watching lhe tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in morking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was mveh weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had onoe so distinguished him now seemcd to have fIed for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidft the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form st0od by hif side\u2014if hc saught it in the woods, her light step would appear woridering amidst the underwood, in qvest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, would show, to his wild imagination, ber pale face and woundedthroat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fIy scene\u017f, every seature of which created such bitter assoclations in hls mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bovnd by thetendor care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection eould be attached: but though they thus haslened fr0m place lo place, yct they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradvally began to slight these reports, which they imaginedwere only the invention of indjviduals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of tbose whom theydofended from pretended dangers. In consequence 0f thvs neglecting the advice of the inhabitclnts, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guordf, moro to serve as guidef tban as a defence. Upon entering, bowever, a narrow deflle, at the bottom of which wcls the bed of a torrent, with lclrge masses of r0ck brought down from the neighbouring preciplces, they had reclsori ta repent lheir negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were slart1ed by the whlstling of bullets close to their heads, and 6y tbe echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guords had left them, and, placjng themselves behind rocks, had begun ta fire in the direction whence the repart came. Lord Ruthven arid Aubrey, iinjtating their example, retired for a moment behind the sholtoring lurn of the dcfiIe: but ashamed of being thus detoined by a foe, who with jnsvlting \u017fhouls 6ade them advance, and being exposed to unres-\nisting slclughter, if ony of the robbers shouId climb above and take them in the rear, they delcrmined al once to rusb sorward in fearch of the enemy. Hardly had lhey lost the sheltcr of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to thc ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedjng the contest or his own peril, was soon surprjsed by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being waunded, imrnediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy pr0misef of great reward, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friond t0 a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed vpon a ransom, he wos rio more disturbed by tbeir presenoe\u2014they being content merely t0 guard the entrance till their coinrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's strength rapidly deereased; iri two days mortiflcalion ensued, and death seemed advancing witb hasty sleps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uncon\u017fcious of pain as he had been 0f the objects about him: but towards lhe close of the last evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eyc often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced t0 offer bis assistance wjthmore than usual earriestness\u2014\"Assist me! you moy save me\u2014you may da morc than that\u2014I mean not my lifo, I heed the death of my existonce as little as thot of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your frjend's honour.\"\u2014\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" repliod Aubrey.\u2014\"I need but little\u2014my life eb6s apace\u2014I cannot explain thewhole\u2014but jf you wou ld conceal all you know of me, my honovr were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if rny doath were unknown for somo time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shall not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising hiinself wilh exultant violence, \"Swear hy all your soul reveres, by all y0ur nature fearf, swcar that, for a year arid a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" sajd Auhrey; he sunk laughing upon his pill0w, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, hut did not sloep; the many circvmstances atlending hjs acquaintonco with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew nat why; when he remcmbered his oath a cold shlvering came over him, as if from the presontiinent of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the m orning, he wa\u017f ahaut to enter the havel in which he had Ieft thecorpse, when a rob6er met him, arid informed him thatit was no longer there, having been conveycd by himsclf arid comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a ncighbouring mount, according to a promise thcy had given bis lordship, that il should be exposed t0 lhe first cold ray of the moon that rose aftcr his death. Aubrey astonished, and taklng several of tbe men, determined t0 go and bury jt upon the spot where it lay. But, wheri he had mounled to the summit he found no trace of elther the corpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjeclures, but he at last retumed, convinced lhat they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which be had mct with such terrible misforlunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to hoighten that superstiti0us melancholy thot had seized upon his mind, he resalved to leave it, ond soon arrived at Smyrncl. While waiting for a vessel to conuey him to Otranto, or to Naple\u017f, he occupied himself in arranging thase effects he bad witb hlm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Am0ngst other lbings lherc was a case containing scveral weapons of offence, maro or less adapted to ensure the death of the vict-\nim. Thcre were several daggers and atoghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise al finding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\u2014he shuddcred\u2014hastcning t0 gain further proof, he sound tbe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shapcd, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seomed ta need no furthcr certainty\u2014they seemed gazing la be bound to the dagger; yet still hc wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon thohaft and sheath were aljke in fplendour on both, and left no r0om for doubt;there were also drops os blood on each.\nHe lefl Smyrna, and on hjs wayhome, at Rome, his first inqulries were coricerning the lady he had attempted lo snatch from Lord Ruthven's sedvctivo arts. Her pclrents wcre in distress, their sortune ruined, and she bad not been heard of since the departure of bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became almast hroken under so rnany repeated horrors; he was afraid thol this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer 0f Ianthe. Hc became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the poslilions, as if he were going to save the life os some one he held doar. He arrived at Calais; a brceze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and thore, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri the embrace\u017f and caresses of his sifter, all memory of the past. If shebeforo, by her infantine care\u017fses, bad gained his clffection, now that the woman begari to appear, she was still more attaching cls a c0mparijon.\nMi\u017fs Aubrey had not tbat winning grace which gains the ga2e and applause of the drawing-room assomblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in lhe beated atmosphere of a crowded clpartmcnt. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mjnd beneath. There was a melancholy chorm about it whicb did not seem to arise from mi\u017ffortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indieate a soul confcious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, whieh strays where'or a butterfly or a colour may attraet\u2014jl was sedate arid perisive. When alone, her faco was never brightened by the smile of joy; bul when her brother breathed to her his affection, arid would in her prosence forget those gricfs she knew destroyed his reft, who w0uld have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\u2014lhat sace werc then playing in the light of their awn native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to lhe world, it having been thought by her guardiaris more fitthat her presentation should be delayed until her brotber'sroturn from the continent, when he mightbe her proteotor. It was now, therefore, resolvcd that tbe next drawing-room, which waf fast ap proaching, should be the ep0cb of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the manfion of his fathers, and fed upon the melanoboly which overpowered him. He eould not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionclble strangers, when his mind bad been so torn by the euent\u017f he had witnessed; but be dotermined to sacrifice his own comfort tothe protection of hif sister. They soonarrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arinouriccd as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was exce\u017fsive\u2014a drawing-room hcld not been held for a long time, and clll who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, bastened thither. Aubrey was there wilh his sister. While he was stariding in a corner 6y bim\u017felf, hoedle\u017fs of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in thatvery place\u2014be felt himself suddenly soized by tho arm, and cl voice hc recognized too well, sounded in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly c0urage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blaslbirn, whon he pcrceived, clt a little distaneo, the same figure whioh had attracted his notice on this spot vpon bis first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weigbt, he was obliged to take the clrm of a friend, and forcing a passagc through the crowd, he threw himself jnto bis carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hu rried steps, and fixed hi\u017f hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014cjrcumstances started up iri dreadful array\u2014the dclgger\u2014his oath.\u2014He roused himself, he could not believe it possible\u2014the dead rise again!\u2014He th0ught his imagination had conjvred vp the image his mind was resling upon. It was impossible that jt could be real\u2014he dotermined, therefore, to g0 again into \u017fociety; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he oould not succeed in gaining inf0rmation. He went a few nights after with his sister to tbe assembly of a neor relalion. Leaving her vnder the prolection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave him\u017felf up to his own devouring thovghts. Perceiving, ot 1ast, tbat mony were leavjng, he rousod himself, clnd entering another room, found his sister surrourided by several, apporently in earnest conversatjon; he attempted lo pass arid get near her, when one, whom he requestod to move, tvrned round, and revealed to hiin those features he most clbhorrod. He sprang forward,scized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, for ced hcr towards the streel: at the door he fourid him\u017felf impedod by the orowd of servants who wore waiting for their lords; and while he was cngaged in passing them, he aga in heard lhat voice whifper close to him\u2014\"Remember your oath!\"\u2014Ho did not dare to turn, 6ut, hurryjng hjs sister, soon reached homo.\nAubrey became alrnost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subjoct, how much more camp1etely was itengrossed, now that thc oertainly of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's atlentions were now vnheeded, and it was in vain that she inlrea ted hiinto explaln to her what had caused bis abrupt condvct. He only uttercd a few words, and those lerrificd her. The more he thought, tho more he was bewildered. His oalh startIed him;\u2014was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruiri upon his breath, amidst a1l he hcld dear, and not auert its progress? Hjs very sister migbt have been t0vched 6y him. But even if he were to break his oath, and djsclose his sufpieioris, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but dealh, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days ho remained iri this state; shul up iri his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister caine, wh0, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nclture. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from streel to strcet, anxious to fly that image which havnted him. His dress became negleeted, and he wandered, as oftcn exposed ta thc no0n-day suri as to the midnighl damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; at first he relurried with lhe evenirig to the house; but at last he laid him down to resl wherever fatigue overtook hiin. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed peoplc lo follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled srom a pursuer swifter than any\u2014from thought. His c onduet, however, suddenly changed. Struck with lhe idea that he left by his absence the whole of his fricnds, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presenco they were unconscious, he determined to entor again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarri, in spite of his oath, a1l whom Lord Rulhuen opproached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and fuspicious l0oks were so striking, hisinward shudderings so visible, that his slster was at last abliged to beg of him to abstain fr0m seeking, for her sake, cl society which offectod him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his rnirid was becoming alionated, they thought it high time to resume agclin thot trvst which had beon before imposed vpon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesjrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandering\u017f, and of preventing him from exposjng to the generaleye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physlcian to reside in tbe house, and take constant care of hiin. He hardly appeared to notice il, so c ompleteIy was his mind absorbed hy one terrible subjcct. His incoherence became at last \u017fo great, lbat he was confined to his ohamber. There he would often 1ie for days, incapable of belng roused. He had beeome emaciated, his eycs had attained a glassy lustre;\u2014tbe only sign of affeclion and recollection romaining displclyed ltself upon the entry of hjs sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing hor hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to to uch him. \"Oh, do not touch bim\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! trve!\" and again he sonk into a state, whence not even she could rouse hjm. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pa\u017fsing, his incohercnces became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guclrdians observed, that seueral times in the day he would count upon hi\u017f fingers a dofinite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon tho last day of the year, onc of his guardianf entering his room, began to coriverse with hls physician vpon the melancholy clrcumstanoe of Aubrey'sbeing in so clwful a situation, when his sisler was going next day to be married.Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning inlellect, af whlch they fearcd he had been deprived, they mentioned the riame of the Earl of Marsden. Th inking lhis was a young Earlwbom he had mct with in society, A ubrey seemed pleased, and aslonished them stilI more by his expressing his intentlon to be present al the nvptials, and desiring to see his sister. Thoy answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by tbe insluence of her lovely smile; for be pressedher to bis brcast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowjng at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warinth, and to congrcltulale her upon her marriage with a pcrson so distiriguished for rank and every accomplishment; when hc suddenly perceived a locket upon ber 6reclst; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long jnfluenced his lifo. Hc sei2ed the p0rtrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking hjm why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future hvsband, he looked as if he did riot understand her\u2014then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression 0f countenarico, he bade her \u017fwear that she would never wed this morister, for he\u2014 But he covld not advance\u2014it seemed as if that v0icc again bade bim remember his oath\u2014he turnedsuddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthveri was near him but saw no one. In the meantjme the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this wos but a return of his disorder, entercd, and forcirig him from Miss Aubrey, dosired her to leave him. He fell upon his kriees to them, he implored, he begged of lhem to delay but for one day. They, attributirig this to the insanity they imagiried hadtaken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had called tbe morning after the drawlng-ro0m, and had been refused with every one e1se. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, hc readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he Iearned that ho wa\u017f deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed frorn those among wham he had gained this iriformalion. He basteried to the h0use of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and lhe pretence of great affectionfor the brother ond inlerest iri bis fate, he graducl1ly won the ear 0f Mjss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hlstongue had dangers and toils to recount\u2014could speak of bjmself as of an individualhavirig n0 sympathy with ony being on the crowded earth, save with her to whoin be addressed hlmself;\u2014could toll how, sinco be knew her, bis existence, hadbegun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thot he might ljften to her soothing accents;\u2014iri fine, hc knew so well how to use the serponl's art, or such was the will of fale, that he gained her affection\u017f. Thetitle of lhe elder branch falling cll length to him, he obtalned an important embassy, which served as an excuse for haslening the marriage, (in spite of hcr brother's deranged state,) which was to tako place the very day 6efore his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left 6y the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servanls, but in vain. He asked for pen and poper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to hls sister, conjvring her, os she valued her own happiriess, her own honour, and the honour of lhose now in the grave, wbo once beId her in lhejr arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The scrvarits promised they would de1iver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more tbe mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravirigs of a maniac. Night passed ori with0ut rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Au6rey heard, with a horror lbat may moro ea\u017fily be conceived than described, tho n0te\u017f of bufy preparatiori. Marning came, and the soundof carrlages brake upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servanls at lclst overcame thcir vigilance, they grodually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless 01d woman. He \u017feized the opportunity, with one b0vnd was out of the room, and in a momontfound himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was lhe first to perceive him: he immediately approached,and, taking his arm by force, hurricd himfrom the room, spcechless with rage. When on the staircasc, Lord Ruthven whispered in his oar\u2014\"Remember your oath, andknow, if not my bride to day, y0ur sisteris dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saylng, he pvshed him towards hls attendonls, who, rouscd by the old woman, hcld come iri search of him. Aubrey could no longer support bimself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a bload-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his slster, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The inarriage waf solemni2ed, and the bride and bridegroom 1eft Loridon.\nAubrey'f weakness iricreasod; tho cffuslon of blood produced symptams of the near approach of dealh. He desired his \u017fistcr's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hovr had slruck, he related composedly what lhe reader has peruscd\u2014he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when thoy arrjved, it was too lole. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where lo choose his place of rest, orid Providcnce his guidc.\"\nIN Sajling lhrovgh the Greoian Archipelaga, on board one of bis Majesty's vessels, in the yeor 1812, we pul lnto the harbour of Mitylene, in lhc island of tbat name. The be auty of this place, and the certclin supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, indvce mariy Britlsh vossels to visit it\u2014both men of war and merchantinen; and though it lies rather out af the track for ships hound ta Smyrna, it\u017f bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; cls usual, at thc bottom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in watcring, and the purser bargolning for cattle wlth the natives, the clergyman and myself to0k a ramble to the cave called Hamer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek cls our guide, who told us he had come froin Scio with an Eriglish lord, who left tbe island four days previous ta our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" \u017faid the Greek, \"and would have laken me with him; but I did not chaose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. Hc was an odd, but a very good man. Thc cottagc over the hlll, facing thc river, belongf to him, ond he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English evrrency,) and has resided lhere about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his folucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosily very much, and wo 1ost no time in hastenirig to the house where our countryman had rosided. We were kindly recejved by an o1d mcln, wh0 coriductod us over the mansion. It consisted of four apart ments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrance hclll, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-r0om, wjth a spaci0us closet annexed. They wcre all fimply decoratod:plain green-stained walIs, mar6lc tablef on either side, a large myrtIe in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which covld bc mclde to play tbrough the bronches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in cl leaning posture; a large eouch or sofcl completcd the fumiture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a singlo painting. The bedohamber hod merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottonquilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed tbroughovt Greece. In the sitting-ro0m we obserued a marble reoess, formerly, the old rnan told us,fllled with books clnd papors, which were then in a large seaman's ohesl iri the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justlfied in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recofs lay Voltoire'\u017f, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, ond Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimrnerman, in lhe Gcrman languclge; Klopstock's Messiah; Katzebue's novels; Sehi1ler's play of the Robberf; Milton's Parodise Lost, an Itcllian edition, printed at Pclrma in 181O; several small pamphlets fr0m thc Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but rio Eng1ish bookof any description. Most of these bo0ks wcre fillcd with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Mossiah was literally scri6bled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on wbich also were remarks.\nTho old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening be fore he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said ho, \"there they must lie until hisreturn; for he is so particular, lhot were I to movc onethlng without orders, he would frown upan ine for a weck togethor; he is otherways very good. I once did bim a seruice; and I haue the produce af this farm for the trouble of taking oare of it, except twenty zeohines which I pay to an aged Armeriiari who residcs in a small coltage in the wood, arid whom lhe lord brought here from Adrianoplc; I don'l knaw for what rea son.\"\nThe clppearance of thehouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front wcls fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars witb black plinths and fret-work cornlces, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably hlgher lhan the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bcllustrade, wcls covered by a fine Turkoy carpet, beneath an awning 0f strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenlngsin smoking, drinking light wi nes, such as \"lachryma christi,\" catirig frvit, and enjoying the evenirig breeze.\nOn thc lefthand as wo cntered the bouse, a small streainlet glided away, grapes, orariges and limes were clvstering together on its borders, and under the sbade of two largo myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an omamental wooden back wcls placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, arid talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" faid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and cllways attcnded our church lwice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nTbe view from this seat waswhat may be lermed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered witb olive and myrtle trees in b1oom, clrid on the summil of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small strearn lssuirig srom the ruins descerided in broken cascades, until it was lost in the waods near lhe mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminoles the view in front; and a llttle on thc left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studdirig tbe light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a viowmore than I did this; but our cnquiries were fruitless as to tbc name of the person who bad resided in this roinantic solitude:none kriew hi\u017f name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will riot,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old fricnd?\" soid I\u2014\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, bul an our return to the town we Iearnt several pclrticulars af the lso1ated lord. He had portioned elght young girIs when he was last upon the island, and euen danced wjth them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow lo one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk lo the girlswho live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisher man who had lost his own in a gale, and hc often gave Greek Testaments to the paor chi1drcn. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eocentric and benevolent charactor. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thougbt proper not to disclose. He had a mo\u017ft beoutisul daughter, wlth whom tbe lord waf often seen walking on the secl-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself tho use of it.\nSuch was the information with whicb we doparted from the peaceful isle 0f Mitylene; our imaginalions all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greeee could be. Hc hcld money it was evident: he hcld philanthropy of dispo\u017fition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar gonius. Arrived at Palermo, al1 our doubts were dispelled. Falling jn company wilh Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had beon travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are s0 anxious, is Lord Byron; I met hlm in my travels 0n the island of Tenedos, ond I alsa uisited him at Mitylene.\" We had never thon heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years srom home; but \"Childe Horolde\" being put into our hands we recogni2ed the recluse of Calcla in every pagc. Deeply did we regret not having been more curi0us in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled oursolvcs with the idea of retvrning to MityIene on some future day; but to rne that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in jvstice to his lordship's good name, which has hoeri grossly slandered. He has been descri-\n bed as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or oontributjrig in any way to sootb its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. The fact is directIy the reverse, as may be plainly gathered fram these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegaritly deplcted in hls lordship's poems, seem to havetheir seat in his b0som. Tendernc\u017fs, syinpatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the reposo 0f solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a bei ng on whose heart Religion hath \u017fet her seaI, and over whose head Benevolerice hcltb thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a counlryman. With respeot to his loues or pleasures, I do not assume a right to giue ari opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, partieularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before tbat awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortcll. Lord Byron's character is wortby of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testiinony of a virtu0us beart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet."}

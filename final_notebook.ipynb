              "'THE VAMPYRE;\\nA Tale.\\nBy John William Polidori\\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre\\'s grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\\nChief bailiff.\\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father\\'s name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek\\'s last tinge—her eye\\'s last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o\\'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection\\'s fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object\\'s face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her\\'s, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners\\' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter\\'s eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven\\'s affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven\\'s character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune\\'s law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey\\'s eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey\\'s interposition.\\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet\\'s paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain\\'s side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun\\'s ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend\\'s appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child\\'s death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid\\'s recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\\nAubrey\\'s mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe\\'s form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers\\' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven\\'s being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven\\'s strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend\\'s honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world\\'s mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven\\'s seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey\\'s mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where\\'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother\\'s return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister\\'s arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster\\'s living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister\\'s attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey\\'s parents.\\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey\\'s being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey\\'s attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother\\'s being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey\\'s ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent\\'s art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother\\'s deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\\nAubrey\\'s weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister\\'s guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey\\'s sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON\\'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON\\'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty\\'s vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer\\'s School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman\\'s chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire\\'s, Shakspeare\\'s, Boileau\\'s, and Rousseau\\'s works complete; Volney\\'s Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock\\'s Messiah; Kotzebue\\'s novels; Schiller\\'s play of the Robbers; Milton\\'s Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don\\'t know for what reason.\"\\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o\\'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird\\'s-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain\\'s base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT\\'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship\\'s fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship\\'s good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship\\'s poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man\\'s moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron\\'s character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world\\'s applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\\nTHE END\\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.'"

Amorig tbe Arabians it oppears to be comman: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establisbment of Christianity; and it has only assumed ils present form since the division of the Latin and Groek churches; at which limo, the idea becomirig prevalent, that a Latinbody could not oorrupt if buried in their territory, it gradvally increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfvl stories, stlll extant, of the dead rising from thcir graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West lt spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austricl, and Lor rajno, where the belief exlsted, lhat vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion af the blood of their victims, who bocame emclciatod, losttbeir strenglh, and speedily dicd of consumptions; whilst these human bIood-suckers sattcned\\u2014and their veins bocame distended to such a state of repletion, as lo cause the blood to flow from a1l the possages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\\nIn tho London Journal, 0f March, 1732, is a curiaus, and, of oourse, crcdibleaccount of a particular casc os vampyrism, which is stated tohave occurred at Madreyga, inHungary. Il appears, that upon cln examination of the commander -in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they p0sitively and unonimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontierf of the Tu rkish Servia, he had hecn tormented by a vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by ealing some of the earth out of the vampyrc's grave, and rubbirig himse1f with his blood. This preeoution, however, did not prevent him fram becoining a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and 6vrial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprlved of life by his attacks. To preuent further mischief,the inhabltantf having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrifm) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pvre and fIorid blood. Proof having beeri thus obtained, they resorted to the accvstomed remedy. A \\u017ftclke was driven entirely thr0ugh the heart and body of A rnold Paul, at which he is reported to havo cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes inlo his grave. The sarne measures were adopted wlth the corses of those persans who had previously died from vclmpyrism, lest theyshould, in thcir tvrn, become agents upan others who sur-\\nvived them.\\nThe uriiversal belief is, that a person sueked by a vampyre becomes a uampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\\nChief 6ailiff.\\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relaled, because il secms better adapted to jllustrate the subject of the present o6servcltions than any otber instance which couId be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is cansidered as a sort of purii\\u017fhment after death, for some heinous crime eommitted whilst in existerice, thal the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrife, but compelled to consine his infernal vifitations solely to those beings ho loved most while upon earth\\u2014those to whom he was b ound by ties of kindred and affection.\\u2014A supposition alluded to in thc \\\"Gi aour.\\\"\\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy c0rse shall from its tomb be rent; Tben ghastly baunt tho nalive plac e, And suck the blood of all lhy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wlfe, At midnight drain thc stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy uictims, ero they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing theo, lhou cursing t hem, Thy flowcrs are withcred on the stem. But ono that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a fatber's name\\u2014 Thclt word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's Iast tinge\\u2014her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance musl view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest plodge was worn\\u2014 But n0w is borno away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own bestblood sball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard llp; Thcn \\u017ftalking to thy sullen grove, Ga\\u2014and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sbrink away From spectre more clccursed than they.\\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wl1d but beautiful poem of \\\"Thaloba,\\\" the vampyre corso of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the gravo for the purpose of tormentjng him she be\\u017ft loved whilst in existerice. But this cannot be supposed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, sbe being pourtrayod tbrougbout the wbole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tho veracious Tourriefort gives a long account in his travels of several asl0nishlng cases of vampyrism, to whlch he pretends to have heen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety 0f anecdotes, clnd traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertatians, tending to prove it to be a classical, as woll af bar6arian error.\\nMany curious and interesling notices on this sirigularly horrible superstition mlght be added; though the present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely rcmclrking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most gerieral acceptation, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts af the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in tho midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared ot the vari0u\\u017f parties of the leaders af the ton a noblernan, more remarkable for his singularities, thon his rank. Hc gazed upon the mirth around him, as if ho covld not participate therein. Apparently, the lighl laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that hc mighl by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensotion of awe, could not explain whence it aro\\u017fe: some attributedit to the dead grey eye, which, fixing up0n lho object's face, did not seem to penotrale, and at one glance lo pierce through to the inward workings of tho heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skiri it cou1d not pass. His peculiarities caused him lo be invited to every hou\\u017fo; all wjshed to see him, and those who had beeri accustomcd to vi0lent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleclsed at having \\u017fomething in lheir presence capable of engaging their attcrition. In spite of tho deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strongemotion of passion, though its form and outline wero beautiful, many of the female bunters after notoricty atlempted to win his altentions, and gain, at least, some mclrks os what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and didall hut put on the dress 0f a mountebank, ta attract his notice:\\u2014though in vairi:\\u2014when she stood besore him, thovgh hi\\u017f eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as jf tbey were vnperceived;\\u2014even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But thougb the common adultres\\u017f could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was n0t that the fcmale sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent eaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innoccnl daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to fomales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whother it was lhat il even overcame the droad of hls sirigular character, or thal tbey were moved by his apparerit hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form thc boast os their sex from their domcs tic virtues, as among those who sully il by their viccs.\\nAbout the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an 0rphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in childhood. Lcft also to himsels by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they re1inquished the more lmportant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary fubalterns, he cultivated more his imagination tban his judgment. He had, hencc, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so inany milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that uice was tbrown iri by Providence merely for the picturesque esfect of thc scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of cl0thes, wbich were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various co1oured patches. He thought, in sine, that the dreams of poets were the realitjes of life. He was hands ome, frank, and rich: for these reas0n\\u017f, upon his entering into the gay oircles, many m0thers surrounded him, striving whlch should describe with least lrvth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters al the same time, hy their brigbtenlng countenances when ho appr0ached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, \\u017foon led him into false riotions of his laIents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance af his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, exeept in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from tbe presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for ariy of that congeries of pleasing pictures arid descriplions contained in thoso voluines, srom which he had formed his study. Findirig, however, some compensation in hjs gratified vonity, he was ab0ut to re1inquish his dreams,wheri the extraordinary belng we have obove described, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched hirn; arid the very impossihility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few olher signs of hif ohfcrvation of external objects, than lbetacit asserit to tbeir existence, impIied by tbe av0idanoe of their eontact: allowing his imaginati0n to picture every thing that slattered its propensity t0 extrclvagant ideas, he soon formed this objectinto the hero of a r0mance, ond dctermined to observe the off\\u017fpririg of his fancy, rather than the pcrson hesore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far cldvanced upon his notice, lhat bis presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt thclt LordRutbven's asfairs were embarrassed, and soan found, from the notes of preparation in \\u2014 Street, thal he was about to travel. Desirous of gajning some insormation respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hjnted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, which for many generations has boeri thought necessary to enable the young to take \\u017fome rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves vpon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallcn from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects 0f pleasantry or of praise, accordlng to the degree of skill sbewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to recelvo from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem fram hjm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly acceptod it, and in a few days they had passed the circling woters.\\nHilhert0, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rvthven's charactor, and now he found, that, though many more of his actians were exposcd to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profvse in his liberality;\\u2014the idle, the vagobond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relievo their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to jndigence by lhe misfortunes altendanteven upon virtue, that he bcstowed hi\\u017f alms;\\u2014these were serit from the door wjth hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk s0mething, riot to relieve his wants, bul to allow hiin to wallow in his Iusl, or to sink hlm still docper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater impartunity of the vicious, which gerierally prevails over the retjrlrig bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There waf one circumstance ab0ut the charity af his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mlnd: all those upori whom it was bestowed, inevitclbly found that thore was a curse upon it, for tbey were al1 either lcd to the scaffold, 0r sunk to the lowest and lhe m0st abiect misery. At Brussels and other to wn\\u017f through which they passed, Aubrey was svrprized at thc apparent eagerness with whiob his companion sought for the ceritres of alI fashionable vice; there he ontered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled wilh success, exoept where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then ho lofl even more than he gained; but il wa\\u017f always with the same unchariging face, with which he generally watched tbe society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novlce, or tbe luckless father af a numerous family; then his vory wlsh seemed fortune's law\\u2014lhis apparent abslractedness of inind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than thal of tbe cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he lefl the formcrly affluent youth, torn from tbe circle headorned, curslng, in the solitude ofa dvngeon, tbe fate that had drawnhim withiri the reach of this fiend; whilft many a father sat frantic, amidst thc speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhaut a slngle farthing of his late immerise wealth, wherewith to buyeven sufficient to satisfy thelr present crauing. Yet he took rio money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner af many, tbe last gilder he had just snatched froin the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mlgbt but be the result of a oertain degree of knowledge, which was not, hawever, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wishedto represent this to his friend, and beg him to resigri that charity and pleasure which proued the ruin of all, and did not tendto his own profit;\\u2014but he delayed it\\u2014for each day he hoped his sriend would glve him some opportunity of speclking frankly and openly to hlm; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and am idst the various wild and rich soenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke les\\u017f lhan his lip; and though Aubrey was neclr the ohiect of his cvriofity, he ohtained no greater gratification from it than the conslant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystcry, which lo his cxal ted imagination began ta assume the appearance of something superncltural.\\nThey soon arrived clt Rome, and Aubrey for a time lo\\u017ft sight of his companion; he left him ln daily attendanee upon the rnorning circle of an Italian covntess, whilst ho went in search of the memorials afanother almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with cager impatience; the first was srain his sister, breathing nathirig but affection; the others were from his guardians,the latter astonished him; if it had beforeentered into hif jmagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, thcse seemed to give bim fufficient reason sor the belief. His guardians insisted upon his lmmediately leauing his friond, and urged, tbat his character was dreadfully vicious, for lhal the possesslon of irresistlble powers of seduction, rendered bis licenliouf habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that bis coritempt for the adultress had not origiriated in hatred of her character; but tbat he had reqvired, to enhance his grallfication, tbat hisvictim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled fr0m the pinnacle of unsullicd uirtue, down to the lowest aby ss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thal all those females whom behod sought, apparently 0n account of their virtue, had, since his departvrc, thrown euen the mask aside, and had n0t scruplcd to expose the wholo desormily of tbeir vices to the public gaze.\\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on wbich lo rest the eye. He resol ved to invent some plauslble pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in tbe mean whiIe, to watch him more closely, and to let rio slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work vpon lhe inexperience of the daughter of the lady whosehovse he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged t0 carry on his plons in secret; but Aubrey's eye foIlowed him in all his windings, and soon discavered that an assignation had 6een appoirited, which would rnost likely end in tho ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartmenl of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he wa\\u017f aware of his being about to ineet her lhat uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon suoh an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended t0 marry her, merely lclugbed. Au6rey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek olher apartments, and calling upon the mathcr of the Iady, informed hor of all he knew, nat only with regard to her doughter, but also concerning the cha racter of his Lordship. The assignatjon was prevcnted. Lord Rvthven next day morely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did nothint any suspicion oshis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps towards Greece, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then flxed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory vpon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chranicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselve\\u017f beneath tbc sheltering soil or many coloured Iichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing ta pourtray on canvclss the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belorig to those wh0 bad no souls. As she danced upon tbe plain, or tripped alo ng the mountain's side, one would have tbought the gclzello a poor lype of her beauties; for who would hove excbanged her eye, ap parently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited bul to the laste of an epicure. The light step os Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after aritiquities, and often would tbe unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit af a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole bcauty of her form, flaating as it were upon the wind, to the eoger gaze of hjm, who forgot the letters he had jusl decypbered upon an almost effaced tablet, iri the contemplatlon af her sylph-like figure. Often would hor tressef falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fadjng huef, it might well excvse the forgetfulness of the antlquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before lhought of vilal importarice to thc proper intcrpretatiori of a passage jn Pau\\u017fonias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreciate?\\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfocted by erowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst be drew thofe remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for hjs future hours, fhe would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the fcenes of ber natlve plaoe; \\u017fhe wou1d tbon describe to him lhe circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hiin in all the glowing colours of yovthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered uiewirig in bor i nfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greator impression upori her mind, would tell him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earneftness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited tbe interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him tbe tale of the livirig vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and deorest ties, forced every yeor, by feedlng upon lhe life os a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whi1st he attempted to laugh her out 0f such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected 0ne living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and childreri had been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, fhe begged af him to believe her, for it had 6een, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confes\\u017f it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appoarance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly oceurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, thal there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same timc he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\\nAvbrey began to attach himself more and more to Ionlho; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected vlrtues of the women among whom he had sought for his visiori of ramance, won his heart; and while he ridicvled the ideo of o young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still be found bimself moreand more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming o plan for some antiquarian resoarch, he wovld depart, determined not to return until his object was attainod; but he always fovnd it impossible to fix his attention upori the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retoined an imoge that seemed al0ne the rightful po\\u017fsessor of his lboughts. Iarilhe was vnconscious of his love, and was ever tbe same frank irifantile being he had first known. Sbe always seemed lo part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had rio longer any orie with whom she could visit her favourite havnts, whilst her guardian was 0ccupied in sketching or uncovering \\u017fome fragment whjch had yet escaped the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject os Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their cxistenee, pole with borror at the vory name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon onc of his excurfions, which was to detain hjm for cl sew hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once bcggod of hirn not to retvrn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where rio Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considercltion. They described it as the resort of tho vampy res in their nocturnal orgies, clnd denounced the mo\\u017ft heavy evils as impending upon him who dar ed to crofs their path. Aubrey made light of their reprefentationf, and tried to laugb them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus t0 mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their bload frce2c, he was silent.\\nNexl morning Aubroy set off upori his excursion unattended; he wos surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, ond was coneemed to find that his words, mocking the beljef of those horrib1e fiends, had inspired them wilh such terror. Wben he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the \\u017fidc of his borfe, arid earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to 6e put in action;\\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon ond, and lhat in tbe horizon there was one of those specks which, lnthe warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous inass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counlry.\\u2014He at last, however, rnounled his horse, dotermined to make up by speed for hif delay: but it was too late. Twilight, jn these southern climates, if almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: ond ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an lntcrval of rest\\u2014its thick heavy rain foroed its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning feemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly hjs horse took sright, and he was corriod with dreadsul rapidity through thc entangled f0resl. The anlmal at Iast, through fatigue, stopped, arid he found,by tbe glare of lighlning, that he was in the neigh6ourhood of ahovel that bardly lifted itself up from the massos of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find soine one to guide him to the town, or at least trustjng to abtain sbeltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moinent silent, alIowed him to hear the dreadfvl shrieks 0f a woman mingling with the stiflcd, exuItant mockery os a lclugh, continued in one alm0st unbroken sound;\\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled ouer his head, he, wjth a sudden efforl, forced open the door af the hut. He found himsols in vtter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, clnd no notioe wcls taken of him. He found himself in c0ntact with some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a voice cried, \\\"Agoin baffled!\\\" to which a laud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his llfe as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wos in vclin: he was lifted from his seet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\\u2014his enemy lhrew himself upon him, and kneeling upon hif breast, had placcd his hands upon his lhroat\\u2014wben the glare of many torches penetrating through the hale that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a mo ment the crclshirig of the branchos, a\\u017f he broko through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm waf now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the Iight of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every jndividual strow with hoavy flakes of soot. At the desire os Aubrey thoy searched for her who had atlracted him by her cries; he was again lcft iri darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form 0f bis fair conductress brought in a lifeless eorse. He shut his eyes, hoping lhat jt was bul a visi on arising from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unolosed them, stretcbed 6y his side. There wos no colour upon hcr cheek, riot even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess about her face that seemed almost as attaohing as the life that once dweIt there:\\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veiri:\\u2014to this thc meri poinled, cryirig, simultaneously struck with horror, \\\"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\\\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was lclid by the sjde of her who had latoly been to him the obiect of sa many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flowor of life that bad died witbin her. He knew not what his thoughts were\\u2014his mind was benumbed and seemed lo shun reflection, and take rcfuge in vacancy\\u2014he held a1most unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular con\\u017ftruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soori met by different parties who had been engaged in the seclrch of her wbom a mother bad missed. T heir lamentable cries, as they approached lhe city, forewarned the parents of some droadful catastrophe. \\u2014To describe thelr grief would be impossibIe; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they lo0kedat Aubrey, and pointed to the oarse. They were inconsalable; both died broken-hearted.\\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a mo\\u017ft vio1ent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\\u2014by some unaccountclble combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare lhe being he loved. At other tirnes he w0uld imprecate maledictions upon hls head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrjve at Athens, and, from whatcver motive, upon hcaring of lho state os Aubrey, immedicltely placed himself in the same house, and became his constanl attendant. When the latter recovored frorn his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of hirn whose image he had now combined with that 0f a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthuen, by his kind words, iinplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their scparation, and still more by the attenti0n, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled hlrn to his presence. His lord\\u017fhip seemed quito changed; he no lorigcr appcared that apathetic boing who hod so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired jnto the same stato of mind, arid Au6rey pereeived n0 dlfferencc from the former man, except that at timef he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him,with a smile of malieious exultation playlng upon his lips: he kriew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last slage of the invalid's recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watehing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of those arbs, circling,like our warld, the movoless sun;\\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid lbe eyes of clll.\\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, wcls much weakened, and that elafticity of spirit which had once so distinguished hjm now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silence clsLord Ruthvon; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly freqvented, Ianthe's form sto0d by his side\\u2014if he s0ught it ln the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning r0und, would show, to hls wild imagjnation, ber pale face and wounded throat, with cl meek smile upan her lips. He determined lo fly sceries, every feature of which created svch bitter asfocjali0ns in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had takon os him during his illness, that they should visit thoseparts of Greeoerieither had yet feen. They travellcd in cvery direclion, and sought every spot to which arecollection c0uld be otlacbed: but though theythus hastened from place to plaee, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but thcy gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagiried were only thc lrivention of indiuiduals, whose interest il was to excite thc generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dange rs. In consequerice of thus neglecting tbe advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they trauelled with only a fcw gvards, more lo serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed ofa torrent, with large masfcs of rock brought down from the rieighhouring precipices, they bad reason la repent their negligence; for scarcely were the w hole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun lo fire in lhe directjon whence the report eame. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating tbeir example, retired f0r a moment behind the she1tering turn of thedefile: bvt ashomed of being thus detained by a foe, who wilh insulting shouls bade them advance, and beirig exposed to unresisting slaughter, is any af lhe robbcrs sb ould climb above and take thcm jn the rear,they determined al once lo rush sorward in search 0f the enemy. Hardly had tbey loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in the shoulder, whicb brought him to the ground. Auhrey bclstened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest ar his own peril, was soon surprised by seejng the rabbers' faces around him\\u2014hjs guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's bejng wounded, immediateIy thrown up their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promises of greclt reward, Aubrey soon induced them to corivey his wounded friend to a neighbouring eabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thejr pre\\u017fence\\u2014they being content mere1y to gvard the entrance till their comrade sh0uld return with the promis ed sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strengtb rapidly decreased; iri tw0 days mortification ensued, and death seemed advaricing with hasty steps. His conductand appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had 6een of tbe abjccts about him: but towards the close of the 1ast evening, his mind became appareritly uneasy, and his eye ofton fixcd upon Aubrey, who was indueed to offer his ossistance with more than usual earnestnoss\\u2014\\\"Assist me! you may save me\\u2014you may do inore than that\\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death ofmy existcnce as little as tbat of the passi ng day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\\\"\\u2014\\\"How? telI me how? I would do any thing,\\\" rep1ied Aubrey.\\u2014\\\"I need but little\\u2014my llfe ebbs apace\\u2014I cannot explain the whole\\u2014but if you would conceal oll you know of me, my honaur were free from \\u017ftain in the worId's mouth\\u2014and if my deoth were unknawn for some time in England\\u2014I\\u2014I\\u2014but life.\\\"\\u2014\\\"It \\u017fhclll not be known.\\\"\\u2014\\\"Sweclr!\\\" cried the dying man, raising hlmself with exullant vialence, \\\"Swear by allyour soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a ycar and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \\\"\\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \\\"I swear!\\\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon hi\\u017f piIlow, and breathed no rnore.\\nAu6rey retired to rest, butdid not sleep; themany circumslances attending his acquaintanco with this man rose upon bis mind,and he knew not why; when he remembered his aclth a cold shivering came over him, as if from the prosontiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early jn the morning, he was about to enter lhe hovel in which he had lefl tbe corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it wa\\u017f no longer therc, having been conveyed by himsclf and comrades, upon his reliring, to the pinnclcle of a nejghbouring mount, according to cl promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the firsl cold ray af the moan that rose after his death. Aubrey ostonished, and takjng several of the men, determined to go and bury it upan the spot where it lay. But, when be had mounted ta the summit he found no trace of ejlher the corpse or thc clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out thc identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mlnd was bewildered in conjectures, but heat last returned, convinced that they bad buried the corpse sor the sake of the clothes.\\nWeary of a country in whicb ho had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apporenlly corispjred to helghten that superstitious meIancholy that hcld seized upon his mlnd, be rosoIved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna.Wbilc waiting for a vesse1 to convey him ta Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effecls he had withhim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other tbings there was a caso containing severol weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what wa\\u017f his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamerited in the same style as the daggerdiscovered in the fatol but\\u2014he shuddered\\u2014hastening to gajn further proof, he fourid tbe weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. Hls eyes seemed to need no furtber certainty\\u2014lhey seemed gazlng to be bound to the dagger; yet still hewifhed to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of b1ood on each.\\nHe left Smyrna, and on his woy home, at Rame, his firft inquiries were ooncerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents wcre jn distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heclrd 0f since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beeame almost broken under so many repeated horr0rs; be was afraid that this lady had fallen a victirn to the destroyer of Ianthe. He beoame morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postllions, as if he were golng to save the life of same one he held dear. He arrived clt Calais; a breeze, which seemed obediont to his wlll, soon wafted him to the English fhores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a m0ment, appeored to lose, in tbe embraces and caresses of his sistcr, all memory of the past. If she before, by her insclntine caresses, had gained his clfsection,now that the womanbegan to appeor, she was still more atlacbing as a companion.\\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assernblies.There was none os that light brilliancy wbich only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowdod apartmcnt. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of lhe mind beneath. Thero was a melancholy charm about itwhich did not seem to arise srom misfortune,hut from some foeling wlthin, that oppeared to indjcate a soul coriscjous of a brighlcr realm. Her step was not that light f0oting, which strays whcre'er a bvttcrfly or a colaur may attract\\u2014it was sedate arid pen\\u017five. Wben olorie, her face was never brightened by thesmlle of joy; but when her brather hreathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget lhose griefs she knew destroyed his rest, wbo would have exchanged her smile for that 0f the volvptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\\u2014lhal face wero then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Shewas yet only eightoen, and hod not been presented to the world, it having been thougbt by ber guardiclns more fit that her presentation sh0uld be de1ayed until her brother'\\u017f return from the continenl, when he might be her proteetor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was faft approacbing, should be the epoch of her entry int0 the \\\"bvsy scene.\\\" Auhrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers,and fed upon the melancholy wbich overpowered him. He could not fcel interest aboul the frivoIities 0f fashionoble strangers, when his mind had been so torn by lbe eventf he had witnessed; bvt he determined to sacrifice bis own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in t0wn, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\\nThe orowdwas excessive\\u2014a drawing-roomhad not boen held for a long time,and aIl who were anxious to bask in the sinile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a cornor by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remem6rclnce that the sirst tiine ho had seen Lord Ruthven waf in thclt very place\\u2014he felt himsels suddenly \\u017feized by the arm, and a voice he recognized tao wel1, sounded in hiscar\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath.\\\" He had hardly courageto turn, fearful of seoing a speelre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, tbc same figure which had attracted hif notice on this spot upon his first enlry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their wcight, he was a6liged to take the orm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, hethrew himself inlo his carriage, ond was driven horne. He paced the room withhurried steps, and fixed his hands upon bis head, as if he were afraid his thoughls were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\\u2014circumstances started vp in dreadful array\\u2014the dagger\\u2014his oalh.\\u2014He roufed himself, he could ri0t believe it possible\\u2014the dead rise again!\\u2014He thovght his imagination had conjured up the image his mind waf re\\u017fting upon.It was impo\\u017fsible that it could bo real\\u2014he delermined, therefore, to go again into society; for though be attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the riame hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gainjng informalion. He went a few nights after with his sister lo the assembly of a near relation. Leauing her under thc protection 0f a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave bimself up to his own devovring thoughts. Percejving, at last, lbat many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anotber r0om, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently iri earne\\u017ft conversation; he attempted lo pass and get near her, when one, wham he reqvested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those foatures he most abborred. He s prang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, witb hurried step, forced her towards the\\u017ftreet: at the door be found himself impedcd by the crowd of servants who were wajting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\\u2014\\\"Remcmberyour oalh!\\\"\\u2014He did not dare ta tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\\nAubrey become almost dislracted. If before hif mind hod been absorbed by one subject, how much more e0mpletely was it engrossed, now that the certainty 0f tho monster's living ogain prossed upon his thoughts. Hif sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused bis abrupt conduct. He only utlcred a few words, and those terrified her. The more hethought, the more he wa\\u017f bewildered. His oath startled hlm;\\u2014was he then to alIow this rnorister to roam, 6earing ruin upon his breath, amjdst all he heId dear, and not avert its progress? His uery sistor might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspioions,who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from sucb a wretch; hut death, he remembercd, had beeri already mocked. For days he remajned in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sistcr caine, who, with cyes streaming with teors, besought him, for her \\u017fake, to support nature. At laft, no lon ger capable of bearing stillness and folitude, he left his houfe, roamed from street t0 street, anxious to fly thclt image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe inidnighl damps. He was rio longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him dowri to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiou\\u017f for hlssafety, einployod people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled fram a pursuer swifter than any\\u2014from thought. His conduct, bowever, suddenly cbonged. Struck with the idea that he lest by his absence the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconfcious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch hjm closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of bis oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached withintimacy. But when he entered intoa room, bis haggard and suspiciou\\u017f loaks were fo striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his \\u017fister was at last obliged t0 beg of himto abstain from seeking, for her sake, asoclety whichaffected hlm fo strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailirig, the guardians thought proper to interp-\\nose, clnd, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again thot trust whicb had been bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's pclrents.\\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, clnd of prevonting him from exposing ta the gene ral eye those morks of what they considered folly, they engageda physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was hi\\u017f mind ab\\u017forbed by one terrible subject. His incohe rence became at last so greal, that ho was confined to his chamber. Thero he wauld often lie for dayf, incapable of being roused. He had become emociated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;\\u2014the orily sign os affection and recollection rcmaining displayed itself upon tho entry af hls sister; then hc would sometimes start, and, selzing her harids, with looks that seuerely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \\\"Oh, do not touch him\\u2014if your love for me is aught, do riot go near him!\\\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, hls orily anfwer was, \\\"True! true!\\\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however,as the year was passing, his incoherences became 1ess frequent, clnd his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observe d, that severa1 times in the day he would count upon his fingers a defiri ite number, arid then smilc.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of hi\\u017f guardians entering his room, began to canverse witbhis physician upon the melancholy circumstance os Aubrey's boing in so awsul a situation, when his slster was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glcld of thifmark of retuming intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentionod the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thlnkingthis was ayoung Earl wbom he had met with in society, Aubrey soemed pleased, and astonjshed them slilI more 6y his expressing his intention to be presont at the nuptiols, and dcsiring to see his sistor. They answered not, but in a few minules his sister was with him. He wcls apparently again oclpable of being affected by the influence os her lovely smile; for hc pressed her to hisbreast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought os her br0ther's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriagc with a person so distingvlshed far rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locketupon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beho1ding the features of the monsler who had \\u017fo long influenced hi\\u017f life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orid trampled it vnder foot. Upon her asklng him wby he thus destroyed the resemblance 0f her suture husband, he looked as if he did not undersland ber\\u2014then seizing her hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expression of counlenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, sor he\\u2014 But he could not advance\\u2014il seemcd as is that voice ag ain bade him remember his oath\\u2014he turned suddenly rourid, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw rio one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the wholc, and thoughl this wa\\u017f but a return of hi\\u017f diforder, entered, and f0rcing him from Miss Aubrcy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, hc begged of lhem to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanily they imogined had taken possession of his mirid, cndeavoured to pacify hjm, and retired.\\nLord Ruthven had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one e1so. When he heard os Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the oause of it; but when he learned tbat he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be conoealed froin those among whom he had gained this information. Hc hastened to the house of his f0rmer companion, and, by constant atteridance, and the pretence of great affcetion far the brotber and interest in his f atc, he gradually won the ear of Mjss Aubrey. Wh0 could resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils lo recount\\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual havjng no syrnpathy with any being on the cr0wdod earth, save with her to whom he addrossed himself;\\u2014covld tell how, since he knew her, his exislence, had begun to soem worthy 0f preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents;\\u2014in fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's art, or such was the wi1l of fate, that he gajned her affeotions. The title of the elder branch fa1ling al lcngth to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marr iage, (in spite of hcr br0ther's deranged state,) which was to take place the veryday before his dcparture for the continent.\\nAubrey, whcn he was lest by the physician and his guardians, attemplcd to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen andpaper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuring ber, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour os those now in tbe gravo, who oncc held her iri lheir arms os their hope and the hope of lheir houso, to delay bul for a few bours that marriage, on which he denounced lhe most heovy cur\\u017fes. The servants pramised they would delivcr jt; 6vt gjvlng it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, wbat he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pa\\u017fsed on without rest to the husy inmatef of the hauso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may moro easjly be conceiued than described, the notes of busy preparatjon. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon hif ear. Aubreygrew alinost frantic. The curioslty os the servanls at last avercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in tho custody of on helpless old wornan. He seizod the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and jn a moment found himse1f in the apartment where all were near1y assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, spceohless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his eclr\\u2014\\\"Remember your oalh, and know, if n0t my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women arc frail!\\\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, rou\\u017fed by the old woinan, had eome in soarch os him. Avbrey cauld no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a hlood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. Tbis was not mentioned to hjs sister, who was not present when he entered, os tho physician was afroid of agitating her. The marrjage was solemnized, and lhe bride and bridegroom left London.\\nAubrey's weakness increafed; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians migbt be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader bas perused\\u2014he died immediately after.\\nThe guardians bastened ta protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappearcd, and Aubrey'f si\\u017fter had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYR0N'S RESIDENCE INTHE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\\\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of resl, and Pravidence his guide.\\\"\\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, jn the island of that name. The beavty of thif place, and the certain supply of cclttle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce mariy Briti\\u017fh vessels to visit it\\u2014both men of war and mercharitmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom os the bay, and whilst the men were emplayed in watering, arid the purser bargaining f0r cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to thc eave called Homer's Scbool,arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule sonamed) we met with and engclged a young Gr eek as our guide, who toIdus he had come from Scio witb an English lord, who left the island s0ur days previousto our arrival in his felucca. \\\"He engaged me as a pilot,\\\" said the Greek, \\\"and would have taken me witb hjm; bvt I did not choose lo quit Mltyleno, where I am likcly to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottagc over the bill, facing lhe river, belongs to him,and he has left an old mari iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcr, six hundred zoehines for it, (clhout L25O English currency,) ond has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not constantly; for he soils in his felvcca very often to the djfferent islands.\\\"\\nThis account excited our curiosity uery much, and we Iost no time in hastening to the house where our cauntrymarihad resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mclnsion. It consisted of four apartrnents on lhe ground-floor\\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with o spacious closet annexed. They were all simply dccorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables ori either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the brancbes by moving a spring fixed in the side af a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa coinpleted the furniture. In the hall stood half a do2en English cane chajrs, and an empty book-case: thcre were no mirrors, nor a single pclinting. The bedchamber had merely o large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottonquilts and a pilIow\\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sittlng-room we obse rved a marble rece\\u017fs, formerly, the old man tald us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the cl0set: it was operi, but we did not think ourseIves justified in examining the content\\u017f. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsfeou's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Ziminermon, in the German language; Klopslock'f Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schjller'splcly of theRohbers; MiIton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek pross at Constantinople, much torn, 6ut no English bo0k of clny description. Most of these books wore filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ilalian arid Latin. The Mossiah was literally scribbIed all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\\nThe old man said: \\\"Thelord had been reading these books the evening before be sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bul,\\\" said he, \\\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing wilhovt orders, be would frowri upon me for a week together; he is 0therways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a sma1l eottage jn tbe wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanaple; I don't know for whal reason.\\\"\\nThe appearance of the house externally was pIeasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the f1uted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornioes, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) wero consjderably higher than the roos. The roof, surrourided by a light st0ne balustrade, was coveredby a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strorig coarse linen. Most 0f the bouse-t0ps ore thus furnished,as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in sinoking, drinking light wines, such as \\\"lachryma christi,\\\" eating fruit, and enjoying lhe everiing breeze.\\nOn the left harid as we enterod the house, a small streamlot glided away, grapes, oranges andllmes were cluslering together on itf borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe feat with an ornamentaI wooden back waf placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twclve o'clock, reading, wriling, and lalking to himself. \\\"I suppose,\\\" said tho old mon, \\\"prayirig\\\" for he wcls very devout, \\\"and always atterided our chvrch lwice a week, hesides Sundays.\\\"\\nThe view fram this seot was what may be terrned \\\"a bird's-eye view.\\\" A line of rich uineyords led the eye to Mount Calclo, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of whjch an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A s mall stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the wood\\u017f near the mountairi'sbase. The sea smooth as glass, and an horjzon unshadowed by a single eloud, terminates the view in front; and o ljttle on the le ft, through a vista of lofty chesriut arid palm-trees, several small islands wcre distinctly observed, studding the light bluc wave with spots of emerald green. I seld0m enjoyed a view more than I did this; bul our enquirjes were fruitless a\\u017f to lhe name of the person who had resided in this romclntic solitvde: none knew hif nclme but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \\\"The Armenian,\\\" faid our coriductor, \\\"covld tcll, but I am sure he will not,\\\"\\u2014\\\"And cannol y0u tell, old friend?\\\" said I\\u2014\\\"If I can,\\\" sajd he, \\\"I dare not.\\\" We hcld not time to visit lhe Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnl several particulars os thc isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon he was last upon the island, clnd cven danced with them at the nuptial seast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and colton and si1k to lhe girlf who live by weaving these articles. Hc alsa bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gaIe, and be osten gaue Greek Testaments to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared to us, srom all we collected, to have been a very ecoentrie arid berieuolent charaoter. One circumstance we leornt, which our old friend at the cottage lhought praper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the Iord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had hought her a piano-forte, and taught her bimself the use of it.\\nSuch was the informalion with which we departed from the peaceful isle os Mitylene; our imaginations al1 on the rack, guesslng who this rambler in Grecce could be. He bad money it was ovi dent: he had pbilclnthr0py of disposition, and all th0se eccentrjcities which mark peouliar genius. Arrjved atPalermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in compclny with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \\\"The individu al,\\\" sajd be, \\\"about whom you are so arixious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travel\\u017f on the island of Tenedos, and I a1sa visited him al Milylone.\\\" We had never then heord of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from homc; but \\\"Childc Harolde\\\" being put into 0ur hands we recognized the recluse os Calcla in every page. Deep1y did we regret not having been more curious iri our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some fulurc day; 6ut to me that day wilI nover return. I make this statement, believing it not qujte uninterestirig, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has heen grasfly slaridored. He hcls been described as of an urifeeling disposition, auerse to associating with human nature, or contributing in ony way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plain1y gathered from these little anecdotes. All tbe siner feelings of thc heart, so elegantly depicted in his lardship's poems, seem to hclve their seat in his bosom. Teriderness, sympathy, and chority appeor togvido all his actions: and his eourting the repose of salitude is an addilional reason for mar king him as a being ori whose heart Religion hath set her seol, clnd ovcr whose head Benevolence hath tbrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \\\"traits\\\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respcct lo his lovcs or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be roceiued with caution, partjcularly when directed againft man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censurc the errors of a fell0w-mortal.

Among the Arabians it appears to be common: lt did nol, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after lhe eslablishment of Chrlstianity; and it has only assurned its present form since the division of the Latin and Grcek churches; at which time, the idea bceoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in thcir territory, it grcldually jncreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful ftories, still extant, 0f the dead rising from their graves, andfeeding upon the blo0d of the y0ung and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, lhat vampyres nightly imhibed a certain portion of the blood of thoir uictims, wbo became emaciclted, lost their ftrength, clnd speedily died of consumptions; whilst these huinan blood-suckers fatteried\\u2014and their veins bccarne distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow fram all the passagef of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\\nIn the London Jovmal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accauntof a particular case of uampyrism, whicb is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Itoppeors, that upon an cxamination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates af the plaee, they positively and unanimous1y affirmed, that, about five years before, a oertaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Scrvia, hc had 6een tormented by a vampyre,bvt had fovnd a way lo rid him\\u017felf of the evil, by eatirig some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, clnd rub6ing himself with bis blo0d. This precaution, howevcr, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, abovt twenly or lhirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tarmented 6y him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been dcprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mjschief, the inhahitants hclving consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed lo be usual in cclses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and cmitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure clnd florid blood. Proof havirig been thus oblairied, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A ftake was driven entirely thr0vgh the hcart and body os Arnold Paul, at which hc is reported to have cried aut as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cutoff his hoad, burned his body, and threw thc ashes into his grave. Thesame measures were adopted with the corfes of those persons who had previou\\u017fly djed from vampyrisrn, lest they shauld, in their lurn, become ogents upon others who survived them.\\nThe universal heliefis, that a person sucked by a vampyre bccomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hjs turn.\\nChief bailiff.\\nThis monstrous rodomontade if here relaled, becaufo it seems better adapted to illustrate tho subject of the present observalions than any other instance whieh c0uld be addvced. In many parts of Greece it is c0nsidered os a sort of punishment aftcr death, for some heinous crirne cominitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compeIled to confine his infernal visitations \\u017folely to those beirigs he loved most while upon carth\\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties ofkindrod and affection.\\u2014A supposition allvded to inthe \\\"Giaour.\\\"\\nBut first oneartb, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from jts tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt lhe native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of 1jfe; Yel loathe the banquet whioh perforce Must feed thy livid liuing corse, Thy victims, ere lbey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one lhat for thy crime must foll, The youngesl, bcst heloved of alI, Shall bIess thee with a fother's name\\u2014 Thatward shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's Iast tinge\\u2014her cye's last spark, And lhe last glassy glanoe musl view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her ye1low hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affecti0n's fondest pledge was worri\\u2014 But now ls borne away by lhee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thlne own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\\u2014and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, Till lhese in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\\nMr. Sauthey has also introduced in his wild bul beautiful poem of \\\"Thalaba,\\\" the varnpyre corse of thc Arclbiari maid Oneiza, who is represented as hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hjm she best loved whil\\u017ft in existence. But this cannot be supposed to hove resulted from the sinfulness of hcr life, \\u017fhe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a completetype of purity and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which hc pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a varlety of anecdotes, and traditionary narralives illustrative of itf effects, has put forth fome learned dissertatlons, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\\nMariy curious and interesting noticos on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for thc limits of a note, necessarily devoted toexplanation, and which may now be ooncluded by merely remarking, that though the torm Vampyre if the one ln most generaI acceptati0n, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of lhe world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in the midst of lhe dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at lhe vclriovs parties of the leodors os the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. Ho ga2ed upon the mirth arourid him, cls if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of lhe fair only attraoted his attenlion, thal be might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thought1essness reigned. Those who felt this scnsatjon of awe, could not explajn whence it arose: some attrlbuted it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem lo penetrate, and at one glance to pierce throvgh to the inward workings of the heart; bul fel1 upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pasf. His peculiaritjes causod him ta be invited to every bouse; all wishedto see hirn, arid thase who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in thcir presence capable of engaging thcir attentiori. In spite of the deadly hue of hif face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emotion os passlon, thoughits form and out line wore beautiful, many of the femolc hunters afler notorietyattempted to win his attentions, and gain, at lcast, some marks of what they might term affoction: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every rnonster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and did all bvt put an the dressof a mountebank, to attract his notiee:\\u2014lhough in uain:\\u2014when she stood before hirn, though hi\\u017f eyes were apporently fixed up0ri her's, still it seemed as if they were unporceived;\\u2014even her uriappalled impudenco was bafflcd, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eye\\u017f, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such wcls the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that sew knew he ever addressed himself lo females.He had, however, the reputati0n of a winning tongue; and whctherlt wcls thclt itoven overoame the dread of his singular charaeter, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was a\\u017f oftcn among those females who form the b0ast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who suIly it by their vices.\\nAbo ut the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: he was an orp ban left with an only sister in tbe possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guclrdians, who thougbt it their duly iner ely to tako care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit charge of hjs mind lo the care of inercenary subolterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judginent. He had, hence, thal high romclntic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many millincrs' apprentices. He be1ieved all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vicewas lhrown in by Providence morely for the picturesque effecl of the scene, as we soe in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consifted in the vestjng of clothes, w hich wero as warm, 6ut which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, iri fine, that the dreams of poets were the realitles of life. He was handsome, frank, and ricb: for these reosonf, upon his eritering into the gay circles, moriy mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with leasl truth their languisbing or romping favourites: the daughterf at the sarne time, bytheir brightening cauntenance\\u017f when he opproached, and by their fparkling eyes, whcn he opened hjs lips, soon led him inlo falsc notions of his talents and hls merit. Attached as he was to thc rornance of his \\u017folitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except inthe tallow and wax candles that flickered, nat from tho prcsence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptj0ris conlained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, \\u017fome compensation in his gratified vanily, be was about t0 rclinquish his droams, when the exlraordinary being we have above describcd, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched him; and the very impossjbility of formirig an idea os the character of o man entirely absorbed in himself, wha gave few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing thclt flottered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather tban the person before him. He became acquainted wilh him, paid him attentions, and \\u017fo far advanced upori his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, clnd soon found, from the notes of preparation in \\u2014 Slreet, that he was abaut to travel. Desirous of gairiing some informalion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was tirne f0r him to perform the tour, whjch for many generations has been thought riecessary to enable the young to lake some rapid fleps iri the career of vice lowards putting themselves upon on cquality with the aged, and nol allowing lhem to appear as if fallen fram the skies, wheriever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: arid Aubrcy immedialely mentioning his intentioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by sucb a mark of esteem from him, who, apparenlly, had nothing in c ommon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circlirig watcrs.\\nHitherto, Avbrey had hadno opportunity of studyirig Lord Ruthven's choracter, and now he found, that, thougb many rnore of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conolusioris from thc apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\\u2014the idle, the vagaband, and the beggor, received from his hand rnore than enough torelieve thcjr imrnediate wants. But Aubrey could notavoid rcmarking, that it was not upon the virluous, reduced to indigence by the misfartunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\\u2014these were sentfrom the door with hclrdly suppres\\u017fed sneers; 6ut when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his l ust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniqulty, he was serit away witb rich charity. This wos, however, altribvted by him to lhe greoter importunity of the viciovs, which gcnerally prevajIs over the retiring bashfulness of the virtu0us lndigent. There was one circurnstance about the charity of bis Lord\\u017fhip, which was still more impressed upori his mjnd: all lhose vpon whom it wasbestowed, ineuitably found that there was a curse upori it, for they wcre all either led to the scasfold, 0r sunk to the lowest and thc most clbiect misery. At Brvssels and other towns through wbich lhey paf\\u017fed, Aubrey was surprized at tbe apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gainbled wjth success, except where the knowri sharper was his antagonist, and then he lo\\u017ft even more thon he gained; but it was always with the fame unchanging face, with which be generally watched the society around: lt was not, howeuer, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or theluckless fathcr of a numerous family;then his very wish seemed forturie's law\\u2014this apparent abstractednessof mjnd was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled wilh more fire thon that of the cat whilst da llying with tho half-dead mouse. In every town, he loft the farmerly affluent youtb, lorn from the circle he adorned, cursirig, in tbe soljtude of a dvngeon, the fato that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilsl many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking laoks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their prcsent cravlng. Yet he look no money from the gamb1ing table; but irnmedialely lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from lhe canuulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a ccrtairidegree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of combating lhe cunning of the more experienccd. Avbrey osten wished to represent this to his fricnd, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;\\u2014but he de1ayed it\\u2014for each day he hoped his sriend would give him somo opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; h0wever, thisnever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes 0f nature, was olways the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the objeel of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the eonstant excitement of vairily wishirig to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume thc appearance of something supernatural.\\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorlals 0f another almost deserted city. Whilsthe was thus engaged, lctters arrived fram England, which he opened with eoger impcltience; the first was from his si\\u017fter, broathing nothing but affeclion; the atbers were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it hod before ontered into his imaginatjon thal there was an evil power rosident in bis componion, these seemed lo gjve him sufflcient reoson for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, andurged, that his character was dreadfully vici ous, for that the possession of irroslstiblo powers of seduction, rendered his licontious habils more dangerouf to society. It had been disoovered, that his c0ntempt for the adultress had not originated in halred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance hi\\u017f gratificati0n, that his victim, the parlner of bis gui1t, shovld be hurled fromthe pinriacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degra dation: in sinc, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on aceount os their virtue, had, since hls departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformily of their vices to the public gaze.\\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character hcld not yet shown a fingle bright poirit on which to rest the eye. He resolved to inventsome plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposirig, in tbe rncon while, to watch himmore closely, clnd to let no slight circumslances pa\\u017fs 6y unnoticed. He entered into the same circlc, and soon pereeived, that hjs Lordship was cndeavouring to work upon lhe inexpcrience of tho daughter of the lady whose house he chjefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarrled female is inet wilh in society; he wcls therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrcy's eyefollowed him in clll his windings, and soon discovered that an assigriation had been appolnted, which would most likely end in the ruln of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abrvptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing bim at the same time lhat he was aware of his heing clbout to mcet ber that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, thal his intenlions were such as he suppos ed all would bave upon such an 0ccafion; and upon being pressed whether he lntended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, imrnediately writing a note, t0 say, that srom that mornent hc must docline accompanying his Lordshlp in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant lo seek other apartmerits, arid cclllirig upon the motber of the lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lord\\u017fhip. The assignation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servarit to notify hi\\u017f camplete assent to a separalion; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans havirig been soiled by Aubrey's interp0sition.\\nHav ing 1eft Rome, Aubrey directed his stepstowards Greece, ond crossing lhe Pcnin\\u017fula, soon found himself at Athens. He thon fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occvpied himself in tracing the faded records of clncient glory upon monuments lhat apparently, afhomed 0f chronicllrig tbe deeds of froemen only before slaves, had hidden themsolves beneath the sholtering soil or mclny coloured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself, existed a being, so beautlful and delicate, thal she might have formed the model for a pai-\\nntcr wisbing to povrlray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet'\\u017f paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any orie to think she could belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced upon lhe plain, or tripped olong the mountain's side, 0ne would have thought the gazel1e a poor type os her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eycof animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the ariimaI suited but to the tasto ofan epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, origaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, fhow the wholo beauty of her form, floating cls it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze os blm, who forgot the letters hc had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the conlemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would ber tre\\u017fscs falling, as she flitted arovnd, exhibit iri the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it mjght well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he bad before lhought of vital imporlance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt why attempt to describe charms wbich all feel, but none can appreoiate?\\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffeeted by crowded drawing-room\\u017f and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wifhed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of hi\\u017f pericil, in tracing the scenes af her nativeplace; she wovld then describe to him thecircling dance upon tbe open pIain, would paint, to him in aIl the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in ber infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impre\\u017fsion upon her mind, would telI bim all the superriatural ta1os of her riurse. Her earnestness and apparent 6elief of whol sbe narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often os she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femole to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh hor out of such ldle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at laft detected one living among thomselves, afterseveral 0s their near relatives and childrcn had been found marked witb the stamp of lhe fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe hor, for it had been, remarked, that lhose who had darcd to questiori theirexistence, always had some proof givcn, which obliged them, with grief and heart6reaking, to oonfess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of lhese monstcrs, and his horror was inoroafed, by hearing a pretty accurate d escription 0f Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that lhere could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he w0ndered at the many coincidenccs whieb had all tended to excite a beljef in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\\nAubrey heganto attach himself more and more to Iarilhe; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women amorig whom he had sought for his vision of romance, w0n his hcart; clnd while he ridiculed the ideaof cl young man os English habits, marryirig an uneducatedGreok girl, still he found himself more and more cltlached to tho almost fairy form hefore him. He would lear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to retu m until his ohjecl waf attaincd; buthe always found itimpossible to fix his atlention upori lhe rvins around him, whjlst in his mirid he retoined on image lhat seemed alone thc rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthc was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctarice; but it was becouse she had n0 longer any one witb whom she could visit her favouritc haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in sketching or vncovering some fragment which had yet efcaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with scveraI present, affirmed their existence, pale with horr0r at lhe very nome. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when thoy heard the name of the placc, they all at once begged of him not to rot urn at night, as he inust necessarily pass through a waod, whcre no Greek w0uld ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any confideration. They describod it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturncll orgies, and denouneed the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cro\\u017f\\u017f their pclth. Aubrey made light of their rcpresentations, and tried to lclugh them out of thc idea; but when ho saw them shudder at his daring thu\\u017f to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name af whicb apparently mado their blood freeze, he was sllenl.\\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon bjs exoursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was coneerried tofjrid that his words, inocking the belief of lhose horrible fiends,had inspired tbem with such terror. When he wasabout to dcpart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly beg ged of him to return, ere nigbt allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupjed in his research, that he did not perceive lbat day-Iight w0uld soon end, and that in the horizon therc was one of those specks which, in the warrnerclimates, so rapidly gather inta a tremendovs mass, and pour all thcir rage upon the devoted country.\\u2014He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make upby speed sar bis delay: but it was too late. Twilight, inthese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced fclr, the power of the storm was abave\\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of reft\\u2014its thick heavy rain sorced itf way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue sorked lightning seemed to fall arid radlate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with droadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The clnimal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hclrdly lifted itself up frorn the masscs of dead leaues and brusbwood which surroundcd it. Dismounting, he approaohed, hoping to find some one to guide hjm to the town, or at loast trusting to obtain shelter from the peltlng of the storm. As he approached,the thunders, for a moment silerit, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockory of a laugh, continu ed in one almost unbroken sound;\\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder whlch agajn rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, foreed open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darknes\\u017f: the sound, however, gulded him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he oalled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom be immediately seized; when a voice cried, \\\"Again baffled!\\\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and ho felt himseIs grappled by one whose \\u017ftrength seerned superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormou\\u017f force agalnst the ground:\\u2014his eriemy tbrew himself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\\u2014when the glclre of mclny torehes penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\\u2014he instantly r0se, and, leaving his prey, rushed throughthe doar, and in a inoment the erasbing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now sti l1; and Aubrey, jncapable of moving, was soon heard by those with0ut. They entered; tho light 0f their t0rches fell upori the mud walls, and the lhatch laadcd on every individual straw with heavy flakes os foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searcbed for her who had attracled him by her cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but whot was his horror, wheri the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduetress brovght in a lifeless c orse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was bul a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw lhe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by hisside. There was no colour upan her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stil1ness about her face that seerned almost as attaching as the life lhat once dwelt there:\\u2014upori her neck and breast was bIood, and upon her tbroat were tho marks of teelh hauing opened the voin:\\u2014tothis lhe men pointed, crying, simultoneously struck wilb horror, \\\"A Vampyre! a Varnpyre!\\\" A litter was quickly forrned, and Aubrey was laid by the side of ber wh0 had lately been t0 bim the object of so many bright and sairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise tbat had died within her. He kriew nat whot his thoughts were\\u2014his mind was benumbed arid seerned lo shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\\u2014he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a parlicular construction, which had heen found in the hut. Thcy were soon mel by different parlies who had boen engaged in the scarch of her wham a mother had missed. Their 1amentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \\u2014To describe their grief would be iinpossible; but when they ascertained lhe cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to tbe corse. They were inconso1able; both died broken-hearted.\\nAubrey bejng put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in lhese intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\\u2014by somc unaecountahle eombincltion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. At ather times he would imprecate maledictions upon his heod, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rvlhvcn, chonced at this time to arrjve at Athens, and, from whatever molive, upon hearirig of the state of Aubrey, immedialely p1aced himself in the same hou\\u017fe, and became bls constant attendant. When the lattcr recovered from his delirium, ho was horrified and startled ot the sight of him whose image he had now combiried with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault lbat had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled him to his preserice. Hi\\u017f lordship seemed quite changed; he no longcr appeared lhat apathetic being who had so aftonished Auhrey;but as soon as his convalescence began to ho rapid, he again graducllly retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, cxcept that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intent1y upon him, witb a smilo of malicious exultatian playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but thif smile haunted him. During the last stage osthe invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparenlly engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in markjng the progress of those orbs, circling, like ovr world, the movelef\\u017f svn;\\u2014indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyesof all.\\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waf much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit whiohhad once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was naw as mucha lover of solilude and silence as Lord Ruthven;but much as he wifhed for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood 0s Athens; if he soughl it amjdst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's forin stood by his side\\u2014if he \\u017fought lt in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst tbe uriderwood, in quest of tbe modefl violet; then suddenly tur-\\nning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pclle face and wounded throat, with ameek smile upon herlips. He determined to sly scenes, every feature of which crcaled such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender oare he had taken of him duririg his illness, that they should visit thofe parts os Greece nejther had yet seen. Thoy travelled in every direction, clnd sought every spot to which a recollcction could be attached: but thougb they lhus ha\\u017ftened framplace to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began lo sligbt these roports, which they irnagjned were only the invention of jndividuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of thase whom lhey defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jnhabitants, on one ocoasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve a\\u017f guides than as a defence. Upon enlering, h0wever, a narrow defile, at the bottorn of which was lbe bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from the nelghbouring precipices, they had reason to repent thelr negligence; for \\u017fcarcely were the whole of the party engaged in tbe narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and hy the echoed report of feveral guns. In an instant their guards hcld left them, and, placing themsolves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating thcir example, retircd for a moment bebind the sheltering turn of the desile: but ashclmed of being thus detained by a fae, who wlth insultjng shovts bade them advance, and being cxposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once lo rush forword ln searcb of the enerny. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rvthven received a sbot in tho shou1der, which brought him lo thc ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance;and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surpri\\u017fed by seeing lhe robbers' faces arovnd hjm\\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, iminediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promi\\u017fes of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his woundod friend to a neighbouring cabin; and bavirig agreed upon a ransom, hewas no more djsturbed by thejr presenco\\u2014they being eontent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promi\\u017fed sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ru thven's strength rapidly docreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appeararice had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objecls about him: but lowards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent1y uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his as\\u017fistance wilh more lhan usual earne\\u017ftness\\u2014\\\"Assist me! you may saveme\\u2014you may do more than that\\u2014I mean not my 1ife, I heed the deoth os my existence as littIe as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's bonour.\\\"\\u2014\\\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\\\" replied Aubrey.\\u2014\\\"I need but little\\u2014my life ebbs clpace\\u2014I cannot expIain the whole\\u2014but if yav would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain ln the world's mouth\\u2014and if my death were unknown sor some timo in England\\u2014I\\u2014I\\u2014but life.\\\"\\u2014\\\"Il shall nat be known.\\\"\\u2014\\\"Swear!\\\" cried the dying man, raising himseIf with exultant violence, \\\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all yaur nature sears, swear tha t, for a year and a day yau will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \\\"\\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from thejr sockets: \\\"I swear!\\\" said Aubroy; he sunk loughi ng upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\\nAubrey rctired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumslances attending his acquaintance wjth this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not wby; when he remernbered hif oath o cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of somethinghorrible awaiting him. Rising early in tho morning, he was about lo enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a ro bber met him, and lnformed him that it was no longer thero, having been conveyed by hjmse1f and comrades, upon bis retiring, to the pinriao1e of a neighbouring mount, clccordingto a promise they had given his lordship, lhat it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rosc after his deatb. Aubroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot whore it lcly. But, when he hadmounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though tho robhers sw0re they pointed out the idenlical rock on whieh tbey had laid the body. For a time his rnind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lost returned, convinced lhat they had buried tbe corpsc for the sake of tbe clothes.\\nWeary of a country inwbich he hadmet with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that svperstitious melancholy that had seized upon bis mind, he rosolved to leave it, clnd soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vesseI to canvey him ta Otrarito, or to Naples, he oocvpied himself in arrangjng thoseeffects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst otber things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or lessadapted to ensure the death of the victim. Therc were several daggers and alaghans. Whilst turningthem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath opparontly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in lhe fatal hut\\u2014he shuddered\\u2014bastening to gain further proof, befound the w eapon, and his horror may be imagincd when he discavered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath hc held iri his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\\u2014thoy seemed gazing to he bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particulor form, the same varylng tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left rio roorn for doubt; tbere were alfo drops of blood on oach.\\nHe left Smyma, and an his way bome, at Rome, his first inquirjes were concernlng the lady he had attemptcd to snatch srom Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not bcen beclrd of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; be was afrold thal thjs lady had fallen a victimto the destroyer of Ianthe. He becclme morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, af lf he were g0ing to save thelife of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to bis will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hastened lo the mansion of his father\\u017f, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of hjs sistcr, all memory of the past. If she be fore, by her infariline caresse\\u017f, hcld gained his affection, now that tho woman began t0 appear, she was \\u017ftill inoro attaching as acompanion.\\nMiss Aubrey had nol that winning grace whlch goins the gaze and applause 0f the drawing-room assemblies. Thero waf none of that light brilliancy which only exists jn the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her bluo eye was never lit up by the levity of tho mind beneath. Therc was a meIancholy charm about it which did not soem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeIing within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her slep was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\\u2014il was sodate arid pensive. When cllone, her faoe wos never brightened by the smile of joy; bvt wheri her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she kncw destroyed bis rest, who would havc excharigod her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\\u2014that face wero then playing in the lighl of their own native sphere. She was yel only eighteen, ond had n0t been prosented to the world, it having been thougbt by her guardians more fit that ber presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved thclt the noxt drawing-room, wbich was fclst appraaching, shovld be the epoch of her entry irito the \\\"busy scene.\\\" Aubrey would rather hove remained in tho mansion of his sather\\u017f, and fed upon the melancholy which overpawered him. He could not fcel interest clb0ut the frivolities of fashionoble strangers, when his mind had been fo torn by the events he had witriessed; but hc determined to sacrifice hif own comfort to the protection of his sister. They \\u017foon arrived in lown, and prepared for the next day, which had 6een announccd as a drawing-rooin.\\nThe crowd was excessive\\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long tiine, and all wbo were anxiovs ta bask in the smile of r0yalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister.While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of clll oround him, engaged in the remembrance that the sirsl tjme he hcld seen Lord Ruthven was in that veryplace\\u2014he feIt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oclth.\\\" He bod hclrdly courage to turn, fearful os sceing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little dislclnce, the same fjgure wbioh had attracted hi\\u017f notice on this spot upon his first onlry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing lo beor their weight, hc wos obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven homc. He paced the room with hurrjed steps, and fixed hls bands upon his head, as if he were afrclid his thoughts were bursting fr0m hjs brairi. Lord Ruthven again besore him\\u2014circumstances started up in dreadful array\\u2014the dagger\\u2014his oath.\\u2014He roused himself, he couId not believe it possible\\u2014the dead rise again!\\u2014He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was restjng upon. It was impossiblc thatlt eould be rea 1\\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for tbough he oltempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the namo hung upon his lips, and he could n0t succeod in gainirig information. He went a sew nights after with his sjster to thc assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under lheprotection of a rncltron, he retired inlo a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceivlng, at last, that many were leaving, he r0used himself, and entering another room, found his sister svrrounded by \\u017feveral, apparently in earnest eonversation; he attempted topass and get near her, when one, whom be requested to move, turned rovnd, and revealed to him those fealures he most ahhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced ber towards the ftreet: at the door he f0und himself impeded by the crowd of scrvants who were waiting for their lords; and while hc was engaged in pafsing them, he again heard that voice whispor close to him\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath!\\\"\\u2014He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\\nAubrey became alm0stdistracted. If before his mirid had been absorbed by one subjeet, how much more cainplete1y was it engros sed, now that the cerlainty of the monster's living again presfed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions wore now unheeded, and it was in vain that she introated him to explain to her what had caused his obrupt conduct. He only utlered a few words, arid those terrified her. Tho more he thovght, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;\\u2014was he then to allow this monsler to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and nat avert itspragress? His uery slster might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discl0se his suspicions, who would bclieve him? He thought of emp1oying his own hand to free thc world from such a wretch; but death, he remembored, hcld been already mocked. For days he remained in thls state; shvl up in his raom, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister carne, who, with eyes strearning with tears, besought him, for her sake, to fupport nature. At lasl, no longer capable of bearing stillnes\\u017f and solitude, he left bis houso, roamed from street to streot, anxiovs to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandored, as often exposcd to the rioon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; at first he returncd with the evenirig to lhe housc; but at last he laid hjm down to re\\u017ft wherever faligue overtook him.Hi\\u017f sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wore soon distanced hy him who fled from a pursuer swlfter thari any\\u2014fr0m thought. His conduct, however, sudden1y changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend ainongst tbem, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hjs oath, all whom Lord Rvthven approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspjciovs looks were so strikirig, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister waf at lasl obliged ta beg of him to ahstain from seeking, for her sake, a sacietywhich affected bim so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, searing that his mind was bec0ming alienated, they thought it high lime to resume again thal trusl which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's pclrents.\\nDesirausof saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to tbe general eye those marks of what they confidered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conftant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely wcls his mind clbsorbed by one terribIc subjeet. Hjs incohererice became at last so great, that he waseonfined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapablo of bei ng roused. He had bccome emaciated, hjs eyes had atlained a glassy lustre;\\u2014the only sign of affection and recollection remcljning difplayed itself vpon the eritry of his sister; then he would fometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afslicted her, he would desire her riot lo touch him. \\\"Oh, do riot touch him\\u2014if your love for me i\\u017f aught, do not go near him!\\\" When, however, shc inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \\\"True! true!\\\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many month\\u017f: gradvally, howeuer, cls the year was passing, his incoherenees bccame loss frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its glaom, whjlst his guordions observed, thal several limes intbe day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and theri smile.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last doy af the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melclnchaly circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awsuI a situatlori, whcn his sister was going next day to be married. InstantIy Aubrey's attenlion was altracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of lhis mark of returning intellect, of which lhey feared hc had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the EarI of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonjshed them \\u017ftill more by hls expressirig his intention to be preserit at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, bvt ln a few minut es his sister was with him. He was apparently again capa6le of being affected by the influence of her Iovely smlle; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing ot the thought of her brolher's being oncc more alive to tho feolings of affeclion. He began lo speclk with all his wonted warmth, and to congralu1ate her upon her marriagc with a person so distinguished for rank and everyaccompIishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast;opening it, what was his surprise at beh0lding the features of the m0nster wbo had sa long jnfluenced his life. He seized the portrclit in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplod it under fool.Upon ber asking hirn why he tbus destroyed the resemblonce of her future husband, he looked as if he did nol understand her\\u2014then sejzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression os countenance, he bade her swear that she would riever wed this monster, for he\\u2014 But he could not advance\\u2014it seemed as if that voice again bade him rememberhis oath\\u2014he turried suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In lhe meantime the guardjans and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entored, arid f0rcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon bis knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They,attribvtlng this to the insanity thoy imagined had taken possesfion of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\\nLord Ruthven had cal1ed the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with cvery one else. Whcn he heard of Avbrey's ill health, ho readily understood himself to be the couse of it; but when he loarned thal he was deemed insane, his exultotion arid pleasure could hard1y be concealed from those am0ng whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brolher and interest in his fate, he gradvally won the eclr of Mlss Aubrey. Who could reslst his power? His tongue had dangersand toils ta recount\\u2014could speak of himself as af an individual having no sympathy with ariy being on the crowded earth, save wilh hor to whorn he addressed himself;\\u2014could tellhow, since he knewher, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listori to ber soothing accents;\\u2014in fine, he knew so well how lo use the serpent's art, or fuch wos the will of fate, that he gained her affcctions. Tbe title of the eIder brarich falling at length to him, he obtclined an important embasfy, which servedas an excuse for hastening tbe marriage, (in spite os her 6rother's deranged state,) which was ta take place the very day before bis departure for the continent.\\nAubrey, when he was left by lhe physioian and his gu ardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pon and paper; it was gjven him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuririg ber, as sbe valued ber own bappiness, her own honour, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held her in thelr arms as their hape and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heauy curses. The servanls promised they would deliver it; but giuing it ta the physician, he thought it better not to harclss any more the mind of Miss Aubrey hy, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed onwithout rest ta the bvsy ininates of the house; and Aubrey heard, witb a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of 6usy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hroke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe curiasity of lhe scrvants at last overcame their vigiIance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the oustody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, ond in a momentfound himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was tbe first to perccive him: he immcdiateIy approachcd, arid, taking his arm byforce, hurried hiin from the rooin, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whjsperedin his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brido to day, your sister is di\\u017fhonoured. Women are frail!\\\" So soying, he pushed him towards his attendonts, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer supporl himself; his rage not firiding vcnt, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was canveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, os the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemriized, and the bride and bridegroom lcft London.\\nAubrey's weakness iricreased; thc effusion of blood produced symptoms of tbe near clpproach of death. He desired his sister's guardlans might be oaIled, arid when lhe midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\\u2014he died imrnediately after.\\nThe guardians ha\\u017ftened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wheri they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had djsappoared, and Aubrey's sisler had glutted the t hirst os a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESID ENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\\\"Theworld was all before him, wbere to chooso hif place of rest, and Providence his gvide.\\\"\\nIN Sailing through lbe Grecicln Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vesself, in thc year 18l2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island ofthal name. Thc beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce manyBritish uessels ta ujsit it\\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lief rather out of the track for ship\\u017f bound to Smyrna, its bountjes amply repay for the devlatiori of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself taok a ramble to the cove called Homer's School, and other places, whcre we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticulc so named) we met wjtb and en gaged a young Greek as our guide, who t01d us he bad come froin Scio wltb an Eng1ish lord, who left tbe island four days previous to our arrival in his fclucca. \\\"He engaged me as a pilot,\\\" sajd the Greek, \\\"and wovld haue taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, bvt a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the rjver, bclongs to him, and he has left ari old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wino-trader, six hundrod zechines for it, (ahout L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, though not oonstantly; for hc sails in his fclucca very often to the difserent islands.\\\"\\nThis account exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the h0vse where our countryman had resided. We were kindIy received 6y an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It con\\u017fisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-roam, a sitting pclrlour, and a hed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They wero all simp1y decorated: plain green-stained walls, marb1e lables on either side, a large myrtle in lhe conlre, and a smclll fountoin beneath, which cou1d be made to play through lhe branches by movirig a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Vonus in a leaning postvro; a large oouch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an emply book-cose: there wero no mirr0rs, nor a single painting. The bedchamber hcld merely a large matt ress spread on the floor, with two \\u017ftuffed cotton qvilts and a pillow\\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sittlng-room we observed a morble recess, formerly, tbe old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which werc then in a largc seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think oursolves justified in examining the conterits. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeclre's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's works complete; Volney'fRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in lhe German languoge; Klapsloek's Messiah; Kotzebue's novols; Schjller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradise Lost, ari Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; seueral small pamphlets from the Groek press at ConstantiriopIe, much torn, but no English book of any dcscriplion. Most of these books were filled with rnarginal notes, written with cl peneil, in Italion and Latin. The Messiah was 1iterally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\\nThe old man said: \\\"The lord had been read-\\nirig these books tbe evening before he sajled, and forgot to place them with the othors; but,\\\" said he, \\\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week togethcr; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, excepl twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small c0ttage in the wood, and whom the lord brought berc from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\\\"\\nThc appearance of the bouse externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces lorig and fourteenbroad, and the fluted mclrble pjl1ars with hlack plinths and fret-work cornjces, (as it is now customary in Grecian architectvre,) wore considerab1y higher than the roof. The roof, surrourided by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnisbed, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenirigs in smok ing, drinking light wines, svch as \\\"lachryma ehristi,\\\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evenirig breeze.\\nOn lhe left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under lbe shade of two large myrtlc hushes, a marble scat with an ornainental wooden back waf placod, on which we were told, lhe lord passed many of his evcnings and nights till twe1ve o'clook, reading, writirig, and talking to himself. \\\"I suppase,\\\" said the old man, \\\"praying\\\" for hewas very devout, \\\"and alwoys attended our ehurch twice a week, be\\u017fides Sundays.\\\"\\nThe uiew from thisseat was whal may be termed \\\"a 6ird's-eye view.\\\" A line os rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covored with olive and myrtle treos in bloom, and on the summil ofwhich an ancienl Grcek temple appeared in majestic deccly. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the inountain's base. The sea smootb cls gla\\u017fs, and an horiz0n urishadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; clnd a little ori the left, through a vista of lofty chesnul ond palm-trces, several smclll i\\u017flands were distinctly observed, studding the light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view rnare than I did this; but our enqvirles were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \\\"The Armenian,\\\" said our conductor, \\\"could tell, but I am svre he will not,\\\"\\u2014\\\"And cannot you telI, old friend?\\\" said I\\u2014\\\"If I cari,\\\" said he, \\\"I dare not.\\\" We had not time to visjt the Armenicln, but on our return to the town we learnl severaI partlculars of the isolaled lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was la\\u017ft upon tbe island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gove a cow to one man, h0rses lo others, and ootton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman wbo had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor cbildren. In short, he appeared lo us, from oll we collccted, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstanco we leamt, which our old frierid at lhe cottage thougbt proper nat to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, wilh wh0m the lord was often seenwalking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taugbt her bimself the use of it.\\nSuch was the inforrnatiori with which we dcparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rclck, guessing who tbis rambler in Greece could be. Hc had monoy it was evident: he had philarithropy of disposition, and alI those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrivod at PaIormo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, tbe architect,a pvpil of WYATT'S, who had been trave1ling in Egypt and Greece, \\\"The individuol,\\\" said he, \\\"about whom you ore so anxious, is Lord Byron; Imet him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\\\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \\\"Childe Harolde\\\" being put into our hclnds we recognized lhe rccIuse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regrot not having been more curious in our researcbes at the cottage, but we confoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some suture day; but to me that day wi1l never retvrn. I make thif statement, bolieving il not qvite uninteresting, and in iustice tohjs lordship's g0od name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, clverse to assoclating with human nature, or contributing in any way to s0oth its sorrows, or add to ils pIeasures. The fact is directly the rever\\u017fe, as may be plainly gathered from these litlle onecdates. All the finer feeljngs of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat iri his bosom.Tenderness, sympalhy, and charity appear to gujde all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitvde is an cldditional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Rellgion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benovolcnce hath thrown her mantle. No inan can read the preceding pleasjng \\\"traits\\\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever t0 be received with cclutiori, particularIy when directed against man's moral irilegrity; and he who dares justify himself beforc that awful trihunal where all mu\\u017ftappear, alone may censure thc errars of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worlhy of his genius. T0 do good in secrct, and shun the world's applause, is tbe surest testirnony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\\nTHE END\\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.\",\n          \"THE VAMPYRE;\\nA Tale.\\nBy John William Polidori\\nTHE suporstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in tho Easl. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself lo the Greekf untll after the estoblishment of Christianity;and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which timc, the idea becaming prevalent, that a Laljn body could not corrupt jf bvried in their territory, il gradually inerea\\u017fed,and formed the su6ject of many woriderfvl stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graues, and feoding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. In the West it spread, with sorne sljght variation, oll over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existcd, that vampyres nightIy imbjbed a certain portion of lhe blood of lheir vjctims, who becclme emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily diedof consumpti0ns; whilsl those human bl0od-sucker\\u017f fclttcned\\u2014and their vcins became distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow sr0in all the passages 0f their bodies, and even from tbc very pores of their \\u017fkins.\\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accounl of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreygo, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examinotion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, abo ut fivo years before, a cortain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a uampyre, buthad found a way to rid himfelf of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of tbe vompyre's grave, ond rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did n0t prevent hiin srom becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days aftcr his death arid burial, many persons complained of baving been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had 6een deprived of life by his atlacks. T0 prevent further mischief, the inhabitants havjng consulted thelr Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is suppofed to ho usual in cclses of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting al lhe moulh,no\\u017fc, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof havlng been thus obtained, they res0rtcd to the accustomed remedy. A stake was drivon entirely througb the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reporled to have crledout as dreadfully as if he had beeri alive. This done, they cvt osf his bead, bvrned his body, and tbrew the asbes into his grave. The same measures wereadopted with the c0rses of those persons who had previ0vsly died from vampyrism, lest they should, intheir turn, become agents up0n others who survived them.\\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by a uampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\\nChief bailiff.\\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, becavse it seems better adapted to iIlustrate lhe subject of tho presenl observations than any other lnftance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it js considered a\\u017f a sort of punishmerit after death, for some heinous crime cominitted whilst in existence, that the deceased js not only do0med to vampyrise, but compelled to confine hls infernal visitati0ns solely to thoso beings he loved most whlle upori earth\\u2014thosc ta whom he was bound by ties of kjndred and affection.\\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \\\"Giaour.\\\"\\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall frorn its tombbe rerit; Then ghaftly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sisler, wife, At mldnight drain the stream of life; Yel loalhe the banquet which perforce Mu\\u017ft feed thy livid 1iving corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon sor tbeir sire; As cursing thee, thou cvrsing them, Thy flowers are withered 0n the stom. But orie that for thy orime mvst fall, The youngest,best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy tclsk and mark Her cbeek's last linge\\u2014her eye's Iast spark,And lhe la\\u017fl glassy glance rnust view Which freezes o'er lts lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow bair, Os wbich, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\\u2014 But riow is 6orne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Tben stalking to thy sullen grave, Go\\u2014clnd with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these iri borror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\\nMr. Southey has a1so introduced in his wild but 6eautiful poem of \\\"Thalaba,\\\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned fram the gravo for lhe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whllst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resv1led from the sinfuIness of her life, she being pourtrayed thraughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenco. Tho veracious Tournefort gives cl long account in his travels of sevoral astonishjng cases of vampyrisrn, t0 which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmel, in bis great work upon thjs fubject, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditionary narratives ilIustralive ofils effects, has put farth some learned dissortotions, tending to provc il to be a classical, as well a\\u017f barbarian error.\\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singular1y horrible superslitiori mjght be addcd; though the present may suffice for the limit\\u017f of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, clrid which inay now be concIuded by merely romarklng, that thougb the term Vampyre is the one in most gencral acoeptation, there are seueral others synonymous with it, made usc of in variou\\u017f parts of the world: as Vravcol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attondant upon a London winter, tbore appeared at the vclrious parties of the leaders of the tori a nobleman, moro remarkable for his \\u017fingularities, than hjs rank. He gazed upon themirth around him, as if he covld not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of thc fair only altracted his attention, that he might by a look quell lt, and throw sear into th0se breasts where thoughtlessnes\\u017f rcigned. Those wh0 felt this senfation os awe, could not explain whence lt arose: some attributed it to the dead groy eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, djd not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce tbrough to lho inward workings of the hearl; but fell uponthe cheek wilh a leaden ray that weighedupon lhe skin it c0uld nol pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited lo every bouse; oll wished to \\u017fee him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weigbt os ennui, were pleased at having somethjng in their presence capable of engaging their attonliori. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warrner tlnt, elther from lhe blusb of rnodesty, 0r from the strong emotion of passion, though its forrn and outlinewere beautiful, many of the femole hunters aftcr notoriety attempted to wjn his attenti0ns, and gain, at leclst, \\u017fome marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockeryof every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, clnd did all but put 0n the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\\u2014though in vain:\\u2014when fhe stood beforc him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it soemed as if they were unperccived;\\u2014even her unappa1led impudenee was baffled, and she left the field. But though tho common advltreff could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent ta him: yet such was the apparent caution witb whicb he spoke to the virtuous wife ond innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Hc had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was tbclt it even overcclme the dread of his singvlar character, or lhat they were moved by hi\\u017f apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form tho boast of their sex from their domestic virtuef, as among those who svlly it 6y thoir vjces.\\nAbout the same time, there carne to London a young genlleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of greal wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alfa to himsolf by guardians, who thought it their duty merely totake care of his fortune, while they relinqvished the more importarit charge of his mlrid lo the care of mcrceriary subalterns, he cultivated more his imaginotion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honovr arid cand0ur, which daily ruins so mony inilliners' appreriticc\\u017f. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and lhought that vjcc was thrawn in by Providence merely sor the plcturesque offect of the scene, as we see in romarices: be thought that the misery of a cottage merely corisisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were bctter adaptcd to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colourcd patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded him, striving whioh should deseribo with least lruth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by thelr brightenirig countenances wben he approachod, ond by tbeir sparkling eyes, when be ope ried his lips, foon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitaryhaurs, he waf startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot fr0m the presenoo of a ghost, but from want of snvffing, thcre was no foundalion in real life for any of thal congeries of pleasing pictures and dcscriptio ns contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinary being we havo above described, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of sorming an idea of the cbaracter of a man enlirely absorbed in himself, wbogave few other \\u017figns of his observation of external objects, tban the tacil asserit to their exiftence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowjng his imagination to piclure euery thing that flattered its propensity to extravagarit ideas, he soon formed this object into the horo os a romance, and determined to ob\\u017ferve the offspring of his fancy, rather than tbe person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far aduanced upon his riotice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually Ieclrnt that Lord Ruthven's offairs were ombarrassed, and so0n found, from tbe notes of preparation in \\u2014 Street, tbat he was about to travol. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted lo his guardians, that it waf time for him to perforrn the tour, which for mariy generalionf has been thought necessary to enable the young to lake some rapid steps in the career of vico towards putling themselves vpon an equalily with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallenfrom the fkies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subiects ofpleasantry or as praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn in carrying thein on. They consented: and Aubrey immediatoly mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive fram him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from hlm, who, appclrent ly, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, arid in a few days they had passed tbe circling waters.\\nHjtherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's characler, and now be found, that, though mony more os his actions were expofed to his view, the resulls offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;\\u2014the idle,the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enovgb to relieve their immediate wanls. But Aubrey eould n0t avoid remarking, that it was riat upon the vlrtuous, reduced to lndigenceby the misfortunes attendont even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;\\u2014these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer\\u017f; but when the profligate came to a\\u017fk fomething, not to relieve hls wants, but to all0w him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was \\u017fent away with rich charlty. This was, bowever, altributed by him to tbe greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the vjrtuaus indigent. Tbere was one circumstance ahout the charity of his Lordsbip, which was stjll more impressed upon his mind: all those vpon whom it was bestowed, inev jtably found that there was a curse upon il, for they were all either led lo tho scafsold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns lhrough wbich tbey passed, Avbrey wcls surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cenlres of all fashjonable uice; there he entered into all the spirit os the faro table: hc betted, and always gambled with fuccess, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and lhen he lost even more than he gained;but it wos always with the same unchanging sace, with which hc gerierally watched the saciety around: it was not, however, so when be encouritered the rash youthfuI novice, or lhc luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wisb seemed fortune's law\\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mirid was laid aside, andhif eyes sporkled with more fire than lhat of the cat whilst dallying with the ha1f-dead mouse. In every lown, he loft the formerly affluenl youth, torn from thecircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within lhe reach of this fiend; wbil\\u017ft many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wecllth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to solisfy their present craving. Yot he look no money from the gambling table; but immediately last, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: thi\\u017fmight bul be the result of a certclin degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable os combating the cvnning os lhe more expericnced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to bif friend, and beg hlm to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend lo hi\\u017f own profit;\\u2014but he delayed it\\u2014for cacb day he hoped hi\\u017ffriend would givc bim some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this neuer occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, arid amidst the various wild and ricb scenes of nature, was always lhe same: his eye spoke le\\u017fs than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from jt than the conftant oxeitement of vajnly wisbing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began lo assumetbe appearance of something supernatural.\\nTbey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a timo losl sight of his companion; he left him in daily ottendance upon the morning circle of an Itolian countess, whiIst he went jn searoh of the memorlals of another almost deserted cily. Whilst he wos thus engaged, letters clrriued from England, whicb he opened with eager impatlence; the first was fr0m his sister, breathing nothing but afsection; the others were from his guordiclns, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagiriatjon that there was an evil power residcnt in his companion, these seemed to glve him sufsicjent reason sar the belief. His guardians insisted up0n hls immediately leaving his friend, and urgcd, that his character was dreadfully uicjous, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduclion, renderod his licentious habits more dangerous to \\u017foeiety. It had boen discovered, thclt hif contempt for lhe adultress had not originated in halred ofhcr character; but that bo had required, to enharice his gratiflcation, that his victim, the pa rtner of his guilt, should be hvr1ed from the pinnacle af unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abysf os infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he hcld sought, apparent1y on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, lhrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled t0 expose the wh0le defor mity of thcir uices to the pvblic goze.\\nAubrey detormined vpon leaving one, whose character had not yet showri a single bright point on which lo rost the eye. He resoIved to invent f0me plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same oircle, and saon perceived, that his Lardship was endeavouring to workupan the inexperience of the daughtor of lhe lady whose house he chiefly frcquented. In Italy, it is seldom that cln unmarried fema1e is met with ln society; he wa\\u017f tberefore obliged ta carry on his plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye followed hirn in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appainted,which would most likely end inthe ruin of an innoeent, though thoughtless girl. Lo\\u017fing no time, be enlered tho apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abrupt1y asked him his intentions with respect to lhe lcldy, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very nlght. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were fucb as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey relired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship iri the remainder of their propofed tour, be ordorod his servant to seek other opartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of aIl he knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the charactor of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rvthven next day merely sont his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion af hi\\u017f plans baving becn foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stops lowards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upan monuments that apparently, asbamed of cbronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering sail or many coloured lichen. Urider tbe same roof as himfelf, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might haue for ined the m0del for a pajnler wisbing to povrtray on canvass the promised hope of lbc faithful in Mah0met's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much rnind for any orie to thlnk she could belong to those wbo had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's \\u017fide, one would have thought the gazelle cl poor type of her beclu-\\nties; for who would haveexchanged her eye, apparently lhe eye of anjmated nature, for that sleepy lvxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an eplcuro. The light step of Ianthe often accompaniedAubrey in his search after antiquities, clnd often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her farm, floating as jt were upon the wind, to tbe eager gaze af him, who forgot thc lelters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced lahlet, in the contemplotion of her sylph-like figvrc. Often would her tresses falling, as \\u017fhe flitted around, exhibjt in the sun's ray such dellcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgctfulness of the antiquary, who let escape fram his mirid the veryobjoct he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attcmpt lo describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciate?\\u2014It was innocence, youlb, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling ballf. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wjshed to proserve a memorial for his suture hours, she would stand by, ond wcltchthe magic effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe soen es of her native place; she wau1d then describe to him the circling dance upon the open pIain, would pclint, to him in clIl the glowing colo urs of youthful memory, thc marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, turning to subjects that had evident1y made a greator impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural taIes of her nurse. Her earnestness clnd apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him lhe tale of the living vompyre, wbo had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the en\\u017fving moriths, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out os sucb idle and harrlble fclritasies; but Ianthe cited to him the nclmesof old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after seueral of their near relatjves and childreri had been found marked with the \\u017ftamp of the fiend'f appctite; and when she found bim so incredulou\\u017f, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those wha had dored to question their existenoe, always had some pro0f given, wbich obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confeff it was true. She detailed to him the troditional oppearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretly accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, stlll persisted in persuading her, that there could he no truth in her fears, lhough at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences whichhad all tended lo excite a belief in the supernatural power 0f Lord Ruthven.\\nAubrey began t0 attach himself more and more to Iarithe; her innocence, so controsted with all the affected virtues ofthe women among whoin he had sought for hif visi0n of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young mcln of Eng1ish habits, marryirig an urieducatedGreek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form hefore him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for same antiquarion research, he would doparl, delermined not to return uritll his object wo\\u017f attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attcntion up0n the ruins around him, whilst inhis mind he retained an image thatsoemod alone the rlghtful pos\\u017fefsor of hls thoughts. Ionthc was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always scemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was bcccluse sbe had no longer any one with whomsbe could visjt hor fav0urite haunts, whilst her gvardian was occupied in sketohing or vncoveringsome fragment which had yet escaped tbe destructivc hand of time. She bad appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and lhey both, with severcll prosent, affirmedtheir exlstence, pale with horror at the very riame. Soon after, Aubrey doterrnined to pr0ceed upon one of hls exoursions, which was to detain himfor a few hours; when theyheard the name of the place, they alI at once begged of him not to roturn at night, as he must necessari1y pass throvgh a wood, whcre no Grcek would ever rcmain, after the day had closed, upon any considerati0n. They descrlbed il as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who daredta cross their path. Aubrey made light of lheir representations, and trjed to laugh them out 0f the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring lhus to mock a fuperior, infernaI pawer, lhe very narne of whichapparently made their hl0od freeze, he was siIent.\\nNcxt morning Aubrey set osf upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to obferve the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned lofind lhclt his words, mocking the bolief of those horrible siends, had inspired tbem with such terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and eorneslly begged of hiin to return, ere night aIlowed the power of these beings to be put in action;\\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his reseorch, that ho did not perceive that day-light would soori end, and that in the horizon there wof one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather irito a tremendous mass, and pour all thelr rage upon the devoted country.\\u2014He al last, bowevcr, mounted hi\\u017f horse, detormined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twllight, in theso southern climates, js almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, njgbt begins: and erehe had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\\u2014its ecbolrig thunders had scarceIy an lnterval of resl\\u2014jts tbick heavy roin forced ils way throvgh the canopying faliage, whilst the blue forked Iightriing seemed to fall and radiate at his very fect. Suddenly his horse look fright, and be was carried with dreadful rapidity lhrough the entangled forest. The anima1 atlast, through fatjgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, tbat he was in the rieighbourhood of a hovel that hard1y lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood whlch \\u017furrounded it. Dismouriting, he approclched, h0ping to sind some orieto guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain sheltcr from the pelting of the storm. As be approached, the thundcrs, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a waman mingling with the \\u017ftifled, exultant moekery os a laugh, continued in one almost unbr0ken sound;\\u2014he was startled: hut, roused by tbe thunder which clgain rolled over his heod, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He f0und himseIf in utter darkness: the sourid, however, guidcd hirn. He was apparently unporceived; for, though he called, still the \\u017founds eontinued, and no notice was taken of him. Ho found himself ln c0ntact with some one, whom he immediately sei2ed; when a voice cried, \\\"Agairi basfled!\\\" lo which a loud lough succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by ane whose strength seemed superhuman: determincd to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; bul it wasin vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled wjth eriorm0us force against the ground:\\u2014his enemy threw himse1f upon him, and knoeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his thraat\\u2014when lhe glare 0f many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed bjm;\\u2014he instanlly rose, and, leaving bis prey, rushed through the door, arid in a momcnt the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, wa\\u017f no longer heard. The storm was now \\u017ftjll; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those wjthout. They entered; the light os their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch l0aded on every individual straw with heavy flakef of soot. At thc desire of Aubrey they searched for her who hcld attracted hjm by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horrar, when the light os the torohes once m0ro burst up0n him, t0 perceive the airy form of his falr condvctress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut hif eyes, h0ping thclt it wos but a vision arisirig from his disturbed imagination; bvt he a gain saw the sclme form, wheri he unclosed them, stretched by his \\u017fide. There was no colaur upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness clbout her face that seemed a1mosl as attaching as the ljfe that once dwelt there:\\u2014upon her neck and breast wos blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having apened the vein:\\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simultarieously struck wilh h0rror, \\\"A Vampyre! a Vompyre!\\\" A littor was quickly formed, clnd Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lcltely been to him the o bject of so many brigbt and fairy vjsions, now fallen with the flower os lise that bad died within her. He knew not what his tboughts were\\u2014his mind was henumbed and seemed to sbun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\\u2014he held almost unconsciously in hjs hand a naked dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the hut. Tbey were soon met by difforent parties wbo had been engaged in the soarch 0f her wbom a malhcr had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parerits of same dreadful catastropho. \\u2014To descri6e tboir grief would be impossihle; but when they ascertained the cause os their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. Thcy were inconsalable; both died br0ken-hearted.\\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a m0st violentscver, and was often delirlous; in thcse intervals he wovld call upon Lord Ruthven arid upon Iantho\\u2014by some unaccountable combiriation he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he l0ved. At othertjmes he wauld imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse hjm as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from wbatever m0tive, upon hearing 0f the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the some house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified clndstartled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, byhis kind words, imp1ying almostrepentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. Hls lordship seeined quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who bad so astonished Aubrey; but as s0on as his convalescence began to be rapid, he ogain gradually retired irito the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived rio difference from the former man, except that ot times he was svrprised to meet his gaze fixed jntently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hjrn. During lhe last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apporently engaged in watching the tideless wavcs raiscd 6y the coolirig breeze, or in marking lhe progress of those orbs, circllng, llke our world, the moveless sun;\\u2014indeed, he appeared to wjsh to avoid the eyos of all.\\nAubrcy's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and thal elasticjty of spirit which had once s0 distinguished him riow seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silerice as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wishod for solitude, his mind could not flnd it in the neighbourhood of Athens; lf he sought it clmldst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iantbe's form stood by his side\\u2014if he fought it in the woods, her light step wouldclppear wandering amidst tbe vnderwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, wovld show, tohis wlld imagination, her palo faoe and wounded throat, with o meek smiIe upan her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every seature of whicb created such bitter ass0ciations in his mind. He propased to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by tbe tender care he had takon of him during his lllness, that they shovld vifit those parts of Greece neither had yct seen. They travelled in every directiori, and sought every spot to which a recolleotiori could be ottachcd: but though they thus hastened fr0m place to pla ce, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard mvch of robbers, but lhey gradually began to slight these reports, which theylmagined were only the invention of individuals, whofe interest it was to excito lhe generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In eonsequence of tbu\\u017f neglectlng the advjce of the inhabilants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a deferice. Upon entering, bowever, a narrow defile, clt the battom of whicb was the bcd of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down fram the neighbouring precipices,they bad rcason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of lhe party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistlirig of bullets closc to their heads, and bythe echoed report of severaI guns. In an instant their guard\\u017f had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, hcld begun to fire in the djrection wbcnce the repart came. Lard Ruthven and Au6rey, imitaling their oxample, retired sor a moment 6ehind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being lbus delained by a fae, who with insulting shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, jf any of the robbers should climb obove and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shclter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received cl shot inthe shovlder, which braught hjm lo tbe gr0und. Aubrey haslened to his asslstance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by \\u017feeing thc robbers' faces around him\\u2014his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown vp their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promise\\u017f of great reward, Aubroy soon jnduced them to oonvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was n0 more disturbed by theirpresence\\u2014tbey being conterit merely to guard theentrance till their eoinrade should return with the promlsed sum, for which he had cln order. Lord Ruthven's slrength rapidly decreafed; in two dayf mortlsication enfued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct clnd appearance had not changed; he seemed as uneonsciovs 0f pain as he had been of tho obiects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent1y uneasy, and his eye aflen fixed upori Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with moro thari usual earnestness\\u2014\\\"Assisl me! yov inay save mo\\u2014you may do more than that\\u2014I mean nol my life, I heed the death of iny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, yavr fr iend's honour.\\\"\\u2014\\\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\\\" replied Aubrey.\\u2014\\\"I need but liltle\\u2014my life ebbs apace\\u2014I cannot explain the whole\\u2014but if y0u would conceal all you kriow ofme, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\\u2014andif my death were vnknown for some time in England\\u2014I\\u2014I\\u2014but life.\\\"\\u2014\\\"It shall not be known.\\\"\\u2014\\\"Swear!\\\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violerice, \\\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by al1 your nature fears, swear that, for a year ond a doy you will not impart your knowledgo of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whcltever may happen, or whatev er you may see. \\\"\\u2014His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \\\"I swear!\\\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breclthed no more.\\nAubrey relired to rest, but did riot sleep; the many circumstances atteriding his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mjnd, and he knew not why; when he remembcred his oalh a coId shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment af something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about lo eriter the hovel in which he had left the corpso, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and eomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnclcle of a neighbouringmount, according lo a promise thoy had given his lordship, that it should be exposed tothe fjrst cold ray of the moori that rose af ter his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to g0and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he hcld mounled to lhe sumrnit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbcrs swore lhey pointed out thc identica1 rock on which they had laid thc body. Far a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lastreturned, eonv inced that they had buried the corp\\u017fe for lhe sake of the clothes.\\nWeary of a oountry iri which he had met witb such terrlble misfortunes, ond in which all apparently conspired to heighten tbat superftilious molancholy that had selzed upon his mind, he resolved ta leave it, and soon arrivcd at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naplcs, he occupied himse1f in arranging those esfects he hcld with him bolonging to Lord Rutbven. Amongsl other tbings there was a ease containlng severol woapons of offence, more or less adapted to en\\u017fure lhe death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Wbilft turning them over, and examinirig their curious f0rms, what was his surprise al finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style os the dagger discovered in the fata1 hut\\u2014he shuddered\\u2014hasteriing to gajn further proof, be found the weapon, and his borror may he imagined when he discovered that it fittcd, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held ln bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\\u2014they seomed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the parlicular form, the same varying tinls upon the haft and fheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; lhere were alfo drops of blood on each.\\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, hi\\u017f first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted lo sriatch froin Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortuno ruined, and she hcld not been heard of since the dcparture of bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost brokeri vnder so many repeated horrors; he was asraid that tbis lady had fallen a victim to the dest royer af Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupatiori consisted in urging the speed of the postili0ns, as if he were going to save the life of fome one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; o breeze, which soemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Eng1ish shores; and he hastened to tho mansion of his fatherf, and there, for a moment, clppeored to lose, in the emhraccs and caresses of his sister, oll memory of thc past. If she befare, by her infantine caresses, had gairied his affection, now that the womcln bogan to appear, she was still rnore attachlng as a c0mpanion.\\nMiss Avbrey had not that wirining grace which gains thegaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that lighl brilliancy which only exist\\u017f iri the heated atmosphere of a crowded aparlment. Her blue eye was never lit up by thc lovity of the mind beneath. Therc was a melancholy charin about it which did n0t seem to arise from misfortune, bvt from some foeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul canscious of a brighter reolm. Her step was natthat light footing, wbich strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract\\u2014it was sedate ond pen\\u017fivo. When alono, her face was nevor brightened by the smile of joy; but when berbrother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence sorget those griefs she knew destroyed hls rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of tho voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,\\u2014that face were then p1aying in the ljght of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presenled to the world, it having been thou ght by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deIayed until her brother's return from the contjnent, whcn he might be her protector. It wos now, thercfore, rosolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approclching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \\\"busy scene.\\\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of hif fathers, and fed upon the melancholy whicb overpowered him. He could not feel interest ob0ut the frivolities of fashionabIe strangers, when his mind had been so lorn by the events he hadwitnessed; bul he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to thc protcction of bis sister. They soon arrivedin town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\\nThe orowd was excessive\\u2014a drawirig-room had not becn held sor a long time, and all who were anxious lo bosk iri the smile of royalty, hastened thithor. Aubrey was there with his sister. Wbile he wcls standing in a corner 6y himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance thclt the first lime he had seen Lord Ruthven was in thot very place\\u2014he felthimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice herccognized too well, soundod in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath.\\\" He had hardly courage to turn, feclrful of seeing cl spectre that would blast bim, when he perceived, ot a little distance, the same sigvre whichbad attracted his notice on this spot upon his sirft entry into soeiety. He gazed tlll his limbs almost refusirig to bear their weighl, he was obliged to take the arm of afriend, and sorcing a passage through lhe crowd, he threw himsolf into his carriage, clnd was driven home. He paced the room witb hurried sleps, and fixed his hands upon his hecld, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him\\u2014oircumstances started up in dreadful array\\u2014the dagger\\u2014his oath.\\u2014He rousedhimself, he could not belieue it possible\\u2014the dead rise agaln!\\u2014He thought his imagination had corijured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\\u2014he determined, theref-\\nore, to go again into saciety; for thougb he atlempted to afk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig upon his lip\\u017f, and he covld not suoeeed in gaining informcltian. He werit a fewnights after with his si\\u017fter to the assembly of a noar relation. Leavirig her under the protection of a matron, he rotired into a recess, and there gave himself up ta his own devouring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, lhat many were Ieavlng, he roused himself, and entering another room, found bis sister surrounded by severa1, apparently in earncst conversation; he attempted to pass and get neclr her, when one, wbom he requested to move, tvrned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprarig forward, seizod his sister's arm, and, with bvrricd step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himfelf lmpeded by the crowd of scrvants who were waiting for their lords; and wbile he was engaged in pclssing them, be again beard lhat voice whisper close t0 him\\u2014\\\"Remernber your oath!\\\"\\u2014He dld not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sisler, soon reached hame.\\nAubrey became alinost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engr0ssed, now that the certainty os the monster's ljving againpressed upon hif thoughts. His slster's attentions were now unheeded, and it wasin vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had eaused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he tbought, the mare he was bewildered. His oclth startled him;\\u2014was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and n0t avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But euen if he were ta breclk his oath, and dlsclose his svspici0ns, wha would belieue him? He thought of empIoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his \\u017fister oame, who, with eyes streamlng with tears, besought him, for ber sakc, to support nature. At last, no longer capable os bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his bouse, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that irnage which haunled him. His dress becclme neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer lo be recognized; at fjrst he returned witb tbe evenlng to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiaus for his safety, employed people ta follow him; but they were \\u017foon distanced by him who fled fram a pursuer swiftcr than any\\u2014froin thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by bis absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend omon gst them, of whose prefence they were unconsci0us, he determined to enter again into society, and wotch him closely, anxious toforewarn, jn spite of bis oath, allwhom Lord Ruthven appraached with intimacy. But when he enlered lnto aroom, his baggard clrid \\u017fuspicious looks were so striking, his inward fhudderings so visible, that his sister wcls al lost abliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake,a sociely which clffocted him s0 strongly. When, however, remonstrarice proved unavailing, the guardiansthought proper to interpose,and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, tbey thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been beforo imposcd upon them by Aubrey's porents.\\nDesirous of faving hlm from the injuries and suffering\\u017f be had daily encounterod iri his wanderings, and of preventirig him fr0m exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, lhey engaged a physician lo reside in the hovse, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeored to notice it, sa completeIy was his mind absorbed by ono terrible subjoct. His incaherence becamcat last so great, that he was confined to his cbamber. There he would often lie for dayf, incapable of being roused. He had hecome emaeiated, his eyes hcld attained a glasfy lustre;\\u2014the only sign of affecti0n and recollcction remainingdisplayed itself upori the enlry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that seuerely afflicted her, he would dcsire her not to touch him. \\\"Oh, do not toucb him\\u2014if your love for me is aught, do not ga near him!\\\" Wheri, however, she inquired lo whom he referred, his only answer was, \\\"True! true!\\\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lclsted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pas\\u017fing, his incohcrences became 1ess frequent, and bis rnind thrcw off a portion of its gl0om, whilst his guardiaris observed, that several times inthe day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, ane of his guardians entering hls room, began lo conuerse with bis physiclan upon tbc melancboly eircumstance os Aubrey's beirig in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelIeot, af which they feared he hod heen dcprived, they inentioned the namo of lhe Earl of Marsderi. Thiriking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in soclely, Avhrey seemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by his expressirig his lntention la be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes hjs sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of belng affected by the influence of her lovely smilo; for he presscd ber to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brather's being once rnore aliue to lhe feelings of affectjon. He began lo speak with all his wonted warmth, and to corigratulate her upon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evcry accompllsbmenl; when be suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; open ing it, what was his surprise at 6choldirig the features of the monster who had so long influenced his ljse. He seized the p0rtrait in a paroxysrn of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her osking hiin why he thus destroyed lhe resemblarice of her future husbclnd, he looked as if he did not understand her\\u2014then seizing her bands, and gazing ori her with a frantic exprossion 0f countcnance, he badc ber swear that she would never wed this rnonster, for he\\u2014 But he could not cldvance\\u2014it seemed as if that uojce again bade him remember his oath\\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought thls was but areturn of his disorder, enter-\\ned, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her ta leavo him. Hc sell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged af them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, cndeav0ured to pocify him, and retired.\\nLord Ruthveri had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. Wherihe heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily vnderstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he leamed that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be conccaled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the hovse of hi\\u017f former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affeclion for the brother and inter est in bis fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his powor? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount\\u2014could speak of himself as of an individual bauing no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save witb her to whom he addressed himseIf;\\u2014could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thal he migbt listen lo ber soothing accents;\\u2014in fine, he kncw so wcll how lo vse the serpent's art, or sucb was the will of fate, that he gained her affeclions. Tbc title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtaincd an important embassy, which served as an excufe for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which wa\\u017f to take place the very day before his departure for the eontinent.\\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardianf, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in voin. He asked for pen and paper; it was givcn him; he wrote a letter to his \\u017fister, conjuring her, as she valued hor 0wn happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who onoe beld hor jn their arms as their hope and the hope of thcir house, to dolay but for a sew hours that marriage, on whieh he denounced tbe most heavy curses. The servants promised they would dellver it; but giving it to the physician, he lhought it bettor not ta harass any more the mirid of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest lo the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that mcly inore easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of cclrriages broke upan bis eor. Aubroy grew almast frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame lheir vigilancc, tbey gradually sto1e away, leaving hjm in the custody of on helpless old woman. He sei2ed the opporlunity, with one bound was out of the room, arid in a m0ment found himself in tbe apartinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri wcls the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takjng his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless withrage. Wben on the staircase, Lord Ruthven wbispered iri his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sist er is dishonoured. Women are frail!\\\" So saying, he pushcd him towards his clttendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in seclr ch of him. Aubrey covld rio longer support himseIf; his rage not slndjng vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. Thiswas nol mentioned lo his sister, who was not present when he enterod, as the pbyslcian was afrclid of agitating her. The marriage wos soleinnized, and tho bride and bridegroomleft Lond0n.\\nAuhrey's weakness increased; the effvsion os blood produced symploms of thc near approach of deoth. He de\\u017fired his sisler 's guardians mig ht be called, and when the rnidnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\\u2014he died immediately clfter.\\nThe guar dians bastenod lo prolect Miss Aubrey; hut when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rulhven had disappeored, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\\\"The world was all before him, where to choose hif place 0f rest, and Providence hisguide.\\\"\\nIN Sailing tbrough the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into tbe harbour of Mitylenc, in the island os that name. The beau ty of lhis place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, iriduce many Brilish vessels to visit it\\u2014both men of war and merchantmon; and tbough it ljes rather out of the track for sbips bound to Smyma, its hountiesamply repay for the deviation of a vayago. We landed; as vsual, al the bottom of the bay, arid whilst the men wereemployed in watering, and the purser bargainlng for cattle with the nalives, lho clorgyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule sonamed) we met with and cngaged a young Greek as our guidc, who told us he had come from Scio wilh an English lord, who left the jsland fovr days previous to ovrarrival in his felucca. \\\"He engaged me as a pllol,\\\" said the Greek, \\\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not chooso to quit Mitylene, where I am like1y to get married. He was ori odd, but a very good man. The cottage over tbe hill, facing lhe river, belongs to him, and he bas left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English eurrcncy,) and bas resided there about fourtecn months, tbough not constantly; for he sclils ln his felucca very osten to the different islands.\\\"\\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening t0 thehouse where our countryman had resided. We were kindly recejved by anold man, who conducted uf over tho mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-slaor\\u2014ari ontrclnce hall, a drclwing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, wlth a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorclted: plain green-stained wolls, marble tablcs on either side, a largo myrtle in lhe centre, and a small fountain beneath,which could be made to play through the branohes by mouirig a spring fjxed in the side of a small br0nze Venus in a learilng posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnjture. In the hall slood half a dozen Eng-\\nljsb cane chairs, and an empty book-ca\\u017fe: there were no mjrrors, nor a sirigle painting. The bedchamher had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottori quilts arid a plllow\\u2014the c0mmon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we obferved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large searnan's chest in the closot: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining lhc contents. On the tablet 0fthe recess lay Voltaire's, Shclk speare's, Boileclu's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Rvins of Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; KIopftoek's Messjah; Kotzebue's riovel\\u017f; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradjse Lost, an Italian edition, prjnted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constanlinople, much torri, but no English book ofany descriplion. Most of these book\\u017f were filled with marginal notes, writlen with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiclh wasliterally scribbIed all over, and marked wjth slip\\u017f of paper, on which olso were remarks.\\nThe old man said:\\\"The lord had been readirigthese books lhc euening before he sailcd, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\\\" said he, \\\"there tbey must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing wltbout orders, he wou ld frown upon me for a weck together; he is otherwayf very good. I once did him a service; and I have tbe produoe of this farm far the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines whieh I pay to an aged Armenian who refides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom tho lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\\\"\\nThe appearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black p1inths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher lhari thc roof. The roof, surrourided by a light slone balustrclde, was couerod by a fine Turkey carpet, bonealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnifhed, cls vpon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, svch as \\\"lachryma chrjsli,\\\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet glided away, grape\\u017f, orangef and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the fhode of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his eveningf and nlghts ljll twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \\\"I suppose,\\\" said the old man, \\\"prayjng\\\" for he was very devout, \\\"andalways attended ovr church twicc a week, besides Sundays.\\\"\\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \\\"a bird's-eye view.\\\" A line 0f rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, couered with olive and myrtIe trees in 6loom,and ori the suinmjl of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smootb as glass, and on horiz0n unshadowed by a single cloud, terminales the view in front; and a little on lhe left, through a vista of lofty che\\u017fnut and palm-lrees, severaI small islands were distinctly observcd, studding theIight blue wave with fpots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirics were fruitles\\u017f as ta the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew hi\\u017f name but Dominick, his bonker, who had gone to Candia. \\\"The Armenian,\\\" said our conductor, \\\"cauld te1l, but I ain sure ho will riot,\\\"\\u2014\\\"And cannot you tell, oId friend?\\\" \\u017faid I\\u2014\\\"If I can,\\\" said he, \\\"I dare not.\\\" We had not time to uisit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt severa1 particularf 0f the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upori the island, and even danced with them at the rivptial feast. He gave a cow lo one mon, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who liveby weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, arid he ofteri gave Groek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collecled, lo have been a very occentric orid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought praper not to disclose. Hc had o most beautiful doughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking 0n thc sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her hjmsolf the use of it.\\nSuch was the iriformation with wbich we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all ori the rack, gue\\u017fsing wbo this ram6ler in Grcece could he. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all tho\\u017fe eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Follirig in company with Mr. FOSTER, the clrchitecl,a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been trclvelling in Egypt and Greece, \\\"The lndividual,\\\" sajd he, \\\"about whom you are so anxiou\\u017f, is Lord Byron; I mct him in my travels ori the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\\\" We had never then heard as his l0rdship's same, as we had been some yoars from home; but \\\"Childe Harolde\\\" being put into ovr hands we rec0griized thc recluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cattage, but we consoIed ourfeIves with tbe idea of returnirig to Mitylene on some futuro day; bvt to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quiteuninteresting, and in justice to hif lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been descrlbed as of an unseeling difposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in ariy way to soolh its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly tbe reverse, as may beplainly gathered from theso little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so clegantly depioted in his lordship'\\u017f poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderriess, sympath y, and charity oppear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitudeis clri additional reason for markinghim as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal,and over whose head Benevolenco halh thrown her mantle. Noman cari read the preceding pleasing \\\"traits\\\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not clssumc a right to give an opinion. Report\\u017f are ever to be receivod with cclution, particularly when directed against man's moralintegrity; and he who dares justify himsels befare lhat awfu1 tribunal where all must appear, olone mcly censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's characteris worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the wor1d's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous beart and self-approvirig conscience.\\nTHE END\\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown-courl, Fleet-street.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"corrected_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"THE VAMPYRE.\\nA Tale.\\nBy John William Polidoro\\nTHE supertition upon which this tale is based is very general in the East. For the Arabs it oppears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Groek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfuly stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West the belief has spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austric, and Lorraine, where the belief established, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who came emaciated, lost their strengh, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers contracted, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the possages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon close examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unequivocally affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain German, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontier of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by cutting some of the earth out of the vampyrc's grave, and rubbing him with his blood. This apprehension, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and trial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants, having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, fresh and foul blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the admitted remedy. A clot was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes in his grave. The following measures were adopted against the horses of those persons who had previously died from violence, lest they should, in the future, become agents of others who committed violence:\\nHe received them.\\nThe universal belief is, that a person suked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\\nChief Justice.\\nThis monstrous crime is here relaled, because it is better adapted to jellustrate the subject of the present proceedings than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is regarded as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in custody, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirism, but compelled to confine his infernal vices solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth\\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \\\"Gi\\u00e0our.\\\"\\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corpse shall from its tomb be rent; The ghastly beast shall baunt the still living place, and suck the blood of all the race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living cells, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing the devil, and cursing him, thy flowers are withcred on the stem. But on that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a fat boy's name\\u2014The word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge\\u2014her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance upon a view which freezes on its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest brush was worn\\u2013 But now is born away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best bloodsport drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Thinking to thy sullen grove, Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sink away from spectre more cursed than they.\\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his work a short but beautiful poem of \\\"Thaloba,\\\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She was loved whilst in custody. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being presented to us by the story of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourtellort gives a long account in his travels of several infamous cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a bararian error.\\nMany curious and interesling notices on this sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared to the variu\\u017f parties of the leaders of the ton a noblestan, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it came: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance not pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin so it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all went to see him, and those who had been accustomed to frequent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female bunters after considerable experience attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some hints of what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his notice:\\u2013though in truth, when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were not perceived;\\u2013even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But if the common interests could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent eaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whother it was that he even overcame the diversity of his sirigular character, or that his admirers were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domiciliary virtues, as among those who sully it by their vice.\\nAbout the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lit also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary officers, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so in any milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that happiness was created by Providence merely for the picturesque aspect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clots, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many men surrounded him, striving which should describe with least description their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters all the same time, by their gracious countenances when he apprached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, they led him into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, exposed in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in the books upon which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified fame, he was about to resume his dreams, when the extraordinary circumstances we have now described, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched him observe the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few more signs of concern of external objects, than of indifference to their existence, impregnated by the avidity of their influence: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the object of his fancy, rather than the person behind him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far progressed upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rutbven's affairs were embarrassed, and so he found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, the place he was about to travel. Desirous of receiving some insolation respecting this singular character, which, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves on an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling voters.\\nHilbert Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Russell's character, and now he found that, though many more of his acts were exposcd to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to satisfy their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to jealousy by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he had deposited his alms;\\u2013these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to overflowing, riot to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his iniquity, or to sink himself still further in his infirmity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater impartunity of the vicious, which germinally prevails over the reticent bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either condemned to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubrey was noticed at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the benefits of fashionable vice; there he flowed into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but he was always with the same uncharitable face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful delinquent, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his vocation seemed fortune's law\\u2014his apparent absoluteness of interest was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the eyes of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he found the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle of friends, crying, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him with them into the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immerse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy the present craving. Yet he took some money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resume that charity and pleasure which proued the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sights of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke loudly from his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he seemed no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which in his cosmic imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernal.\\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him daily attendee upon the rostrum of an Italian court, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his mind that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his habit, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for he the possess of irresistable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his notoriety, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied entertainment, down to the lowest abysm of infamy and degradation: in fact, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask aside, and had endeavoured to expose the whole desolately of their vices to the public gaze.\\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let any slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to enter her room that night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely shrugged. Aurey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek some other apartments, and calling upon the mathematics of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her condition, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was deferred. Lord Routh next day morely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps towards Greece, and cropping the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then left his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of commemorating the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath some sheltering soil or many coloured stones. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing to pour tray on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped over the mountain's side, one would have bought the girl a poor description of her beauties; for who would have excused her eye, ap parently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited her to the last wishes of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after artifacts, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole curvature of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the curious gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had written upon an almost effaced tablet, and the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her hair falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly developing hue, it might well excite the forgetfulness of the observer, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of of great importarice to the proper investigation of a passage in Paradise. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\\u2013It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfocted by eroding drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew up the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the lines of her natal place; she would describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of her deep memory, the marriage pomp she remembered watching in great fancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every man, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, when first he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but then she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected him living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess that it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\\nAvrey began to attach himself more and more to Ionna; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected vivacity of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of passion, won his heart; and while he ridiculated the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still be found himself moreand more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian re-arch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he regarded an object that seemed altogether the rightful proprietor of his goods. He was conscious of his love, and was ever the same frank irrepantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any relatives with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their conviction, with borror at the name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for some hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once cautioned of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reproach, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood boil, he was silent.\\nOn Friday morning Aubroy set off on his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was appalled to find that his words, mocking the beljef of those horribleness fiends, had inspired them to such terror. As he was about to depart, she came to the side of his bed, and earnestly begged of him to return, since night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon come on, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous explosion, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counsellor. He at last called his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, if almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\\u2014its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning feemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly the horse took off, and he was cornered with dreadful rapidity through the entangled brush. The man at once, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that had recently lifted itself up from the mass of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trust him to abtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exuberant mockery of a lugh, continued in one long, unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in communication with someone, whom he immediately seized; but a voice cried, \\\"Agoin baffled!\\\" to which a laudable laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his loot as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his spot and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his heart; but the glare of many torches penetrating through the hale that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, which he brook through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual stack with hoavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again plunged into darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of the fair conductress brought in a lifeless state. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a visi on arising from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretchered on his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, or even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaining as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the wound: to this the prisoner exclaimed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \\\"A Vampyre!\\\" \\\"A Vampyre!\\\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was comforted by the sight of her who had longly been to him the object of many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flow of life that had died wit her. He knew not what his thoughts were\\u2013his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\\u2013he held unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were subsequently met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her wife, whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \\u2013To describe the grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the throat. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a sudden virulent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe\\u2013by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from what can only motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constable. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of the woman whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, expressing almost repentance for the fault that had caused their scarreation, and still more by the attentions, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed scarcely changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic boing who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey received no different from the former man, except that at time he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last slage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or marking the progress of those arches, circling, like our own, the movable sun;\\u2013indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of cllr.\\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elanicity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthvon; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly fretted, Anthea's form would be by his side\\u2014if he searched in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created bitter images in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet visited. They travelled in very direclion, and sought every spot to which their collection could be collected: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the fabrication of indigents, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the rising precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun a fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shetering turn of the mine: but being afraid of being thus detained by a foe, who will not bade them advance, and be exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had reached the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. He rushed to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him\\u2013his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediate thrown up their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to carry his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by the prisoners\\u2013they being content mere to guard the entrance till their comrade would return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed inevitable with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had seventeen of the attendants about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became appareritly uneasy, and his eye fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness\\u2014\\\"Assist me!\\\" You may save me\\u2013you may do more than that\\u2013I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \\\"How? Tell me how? \\\"I would do any thing,\\\" replied Aubrey. \\\"I need but little\\u2013my life ebbs apace\\u2013I cannot explain the whole\\u2013but if you would conceal what you know of me, my hands were free from violence in the world\\u2013and if my teeth were unknocked for some time in England\\u2013I\\u2014I\\u2013but life. It will not be known. \\\"Swear!\\\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant vialence, \\\"Swear by all that your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \\\"I swear!\\\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon the floor, and breathed no more.\\nAurey retired to rest, but did not sleep; any circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his acquaintance a cold shivering came over him, as if from the prospect of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and comrades, upon his reliring, to the property of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning that rose after his death. Aubrey became distressed, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it up to the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appeared evidently conspired to encourage that superstitious megalomania that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamental in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fireplace, but\\u2014he shuddered\\u2014hastening to get further proof, he touched the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\\u2013they seemed almost to be bound to the dagger; yet still he refused to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rame, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victor to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the posts, as if he were struggling to save the life of same one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed almost opposed to his will, soon wafted him to the English seas; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeored to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her intimate caresses, had gained his affections, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more appealing as a companion.\\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room attendants. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded assembly. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling of melancholy, that oppeared to indicate a soul coruscous of a darker realm. Her step was not that light fluttering, which strays which a fly or a colaur may attract\\u2014it was sedate and penitent. When Mary was married, her face was never brightened by the slightest of joy; but when her husband called to her his affection, and would in her presence forget the griefs she knew destroyed his rest, would have exchanged her smile for that of the governor? It seemed as if those eyes on his face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eight years, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thougth by her guards more fit that her presentation should be deferred until her brother's return from the service, when he might be her protege. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was near approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \\\"bawsy scene.\\\" He would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not take interest in the habits of fashionably strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the event he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\\nThe crowd was excessive\\u2013a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and many, who were anxious to bask in the splendour of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a cornfield by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place\\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized instantly, sounded in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath.\\\" He had hardly turned, fearful of seeing a speelre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was compelled to take the hand of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his brains were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\\u2013circumstances started spinning in dreadful array\\u2013the dagger\\u2013his oath\\u2013he roufed himself, he could not believe it possible\\u2013the dead rise again!\\u2013He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was dwelling upon. It was impossible that it could be real\\u2013he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the mystery hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devolving thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an upstairs room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently engaged in conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he required to move, turned round, and revealed to him those habits he most abused. He prang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, forced her towards the door: at the door he found himself impedenced by the crowd of servants who were working for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath!\\\"He did not dare stop, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\\nAubrey become almost dislracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living presence prossed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this murderer to roam, wreaking ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His wife might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspensions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and folitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly from the image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the evening damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for her safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he must by his absence the whole of his friends, with a daughter amongst them, of whose presence he were unconfconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch them closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious eyes were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, excitement which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose.\\nThey, however, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again the trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the common eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His incoherency became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. He would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emociable, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the first sign of affection and recollection having displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seazing her eyes, with looks that frequently afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \\\"Oh, do not touch him\\u2013if your love for me is aught, do NOT go near him!\\\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \\\"True! true!\\\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observe that severa times in the day he would count upon his fingers a great number, and then smirk.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to communicate with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's boing in so awsul a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glaring of the mark of retuming intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them all more by his expressing his intention to be presont at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again incapable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished from rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the man who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it with his foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her to her former husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\\u2013then seizing her hands, and going on her with a frantic expression of concern, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, or he would\\u2013 But he could not advance\\u2013curious as is that voice which had bade him remember his oath\\u2013he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the quarrel, and though this was but a return of ill-order, entered, and finding him from Miss Aubry, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanley they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\\nLord Ruthven had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one present. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attentions, and the pretence of great affection for the brook and interest in his affairs, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Whose could resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the whole earth, save with her to whom he attached himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his affection, had begun to soem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he desired her affeotions. The title of the elder branch being extremely valuable to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of his brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\\nAubrey, who he was lest by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, compelling her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the gravo, who had held her in their arms and the hope of their houses, to delay for a few months that marriage, on which he denounced the most evil customs. The servants promised they would deliver it to the physician, but he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the husky inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last averted their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were now assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, seething with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\\\" Women are frail!\\\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roughed by the old man, had come in search of him. Avrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a window-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, and the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused\\u2014he died immediately after.\\nThe guardians endeavoured to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's generosity had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\\\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of residence, and Pravidence his guide.\\\"\\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The bounties of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\\u2014both men of war and meritoriousmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a course. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were engaged in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to a place called Homer's Scrub and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named) we met with and engaged a young man as our guide, who said he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island some days prior to our arrival in his country. \\\"He engaged me as a pilot,\\\" said the Greek, \\\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit London, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The capacious over the bill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcr, six hundred zeros for it, (in L25s, English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen years, though not constantly; for he soils in his garden very often to the different islands.\\\"\\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our cousin had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the million. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain basin, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chajrs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single window. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow\\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we found a marble chest, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the dock: it was operable, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsfeu's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermon, in the German language; Klopslock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schjeller's Songs of the Romans; Monson's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek newspapers at Constantinople, much torn. No English book of similar description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ilalian arid Latin. The Mossiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\\nThe old man said: \\\"Thelord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\\\" said he, \\\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing against his orders, he would throw me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\\\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanaple; I don't know for what reason.\\\"\\nThe appearance of the house externally was peeling. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the futed marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were consistently higher than the roos. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of very coarse linen. Most of the houses are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \\\"lachryma christi,\\\" eating fruit, and enjoying the ever-changing breeze.\\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and melons were clumping together on the borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble table with an ornamented wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and lalking to himself. \\\"I suppose,\\\" said the old man, \\\"praying\\\" for he was very devout, \\\"and always attended our chapel five days a week, except Sundays.\\\"\\nThe view from this spot was what may be termed \\\"a bird's-eye view.\\\" A line of rich avenues led the eye to Mount Calclo, crowded with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woodlands near the mountaineer's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an hourglass unshadowed by a single eye, terminates the view in front; and below, through a vista of lofty crescent arid palm-trees, several small islands could distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this particular suite: none knew him but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \\\"The Armenian,\\\" said our conductor, \\\"cannot tell, but I am sure he will not,\\\"\\u2014\\\"And can you tell, old friend?\\\" said I\\u2014\\\"If I can,\\\" said he, \\\"I dare not.\\\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon He was last upon the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and colton and silk to his friends who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and presented some Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and debauched character. One circumstance we knew, which our old friend at the cottage thought prudent not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the defendant was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her herself the use of it.\\nSuch was the informality with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations alight on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Grecce could be. He had money it was clear: he had piety of disposition, and all the eccentrics which mark singular genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in compunction with Mr. FOSTER, the archbishop, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \\\"The individual,\\\" he said, \\\"about whom you are so excited, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylone.\\\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \\\"Childcarloe\\\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Defendant. Did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not to be unimportant, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been greatly damaged. He has been described as of an affectionate disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the greater feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lady's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Terribleness, sympathy, and chority apply to all his actions: and his enjoying the repose of salitude is an additional reason for regard him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and on whose head Benevolence hath brown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \\\"traits\\\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be regarded with caution, partly when directed towards man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fallen-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his praise. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the furest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving conscience.\\nTHE END.\\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.\",\n          \"THE VAMPYRE.\\nA Tale.\\nBy John William Polidori\\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually contracted, and formed the subject of many wonderful fables, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blooms of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imitated a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fatteried, and their veins contracted to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passage of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of ampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Witnesses, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimous affirmed, that, about five years before, a young man, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Scrutiny, he had been tormented by a vampyre, and had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with it. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twelve or thirteen days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tortured by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and containing at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure white blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A fork was driven entirely through the hcart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cutoff his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corfs of those persons who had previously suffered from vampirism, lest they should, in their lust, become ogents upon others who survived them.\\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his own turn.\\nChief bailiff.\\nThis monstrous spectacle if here relaled, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observances than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations only to those friends he loved most while upon earth\\u2014those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\\nBut first, as Vampyre sent, thy corse shall from his tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt his native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of blood; You loathe the banquet which you perforce must feed thy lying corse, Thy victims, though they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are withered on the stem. But one thing for thy crime must be done: The young lady, who is loved of all, shall bless thee with a other's name\\u2014Thatward shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge\\u2013her eye's last spark, and her last glassy green musk view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her long hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affect's fondest pledge was made; But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thy own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and will Gouls and Afrits rave, Till they in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\\nMr. Sauthey has also introduced in his wild and beautiful poem of \\\"Thalaba,\\\" the vindictive character of the Arclinchari maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She best loved child in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of human life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete picture of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary descriptions illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\\nSome curious and interesting noticos on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be omitted by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre if the one most generally accepted, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the dinner parties of the lords of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth amusing him, but if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, but he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attested it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; others gazed upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rudesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and out line wore beautiful, many of the female hunters of notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every lady shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all she could to put the dent in a mountebank, to attract his attention: but in fact, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apporently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unplaced; even her outraged impudence was baffling, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that no one knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that they over came the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as popular among those females who form the base of the sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who formed it by their vices.\\nAt the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died when he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by creditors, who thougbt it their duly appointed duty to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit charge of his mind to the care of inercenary servants, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, the high Romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He expected all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that religion was thrown in by Providence morely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we do in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely conspired in the vestiges of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of poets were the real titles of life. He was handsome, frank, and charming: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with all truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening appearances when he opproached, and by their fawning eyes, which when he opened his lips, soon led him in to falsified notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the regiment of his domestic hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified mood, he was about to resume his duties, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea on the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing which flaunted its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced up his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Slreet, that he was unfit to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to make some rapid progress in the career of vice lowards putting themselves upon equal quality with the aged, and thus allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, when scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Arnold, immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apperently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the curious watchers.\\nHitherto, Avrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, although many of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different consequences from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagaband, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid marking, that it was not upon the voracious, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with largely suppresed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his sorrow, or to sink him still deeper in his infirmity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, ascribed by him to the greater importunity of the vicissitudes, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuosi lndigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Majesty, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those persons to whom it was bestowed, immediately found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the abyss, or sunk to the lowest and the most wretched misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gained with success, except where the sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unfailing face, with which he generally watched the society around: he was not, however, a gentleman. So when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the unfortunate fathcr of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed contrary to Murphy's law\\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst lying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he loomed from the circle he adorned, lurking, in the soliloquy of a dungeon, the fato that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking calls of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their peculiar needs. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the canulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a corruptive disposition of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avrey osten wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he declined it\\u2013for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but, wever, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the eonstant excitement of vairily wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoranda of another almost deserted city. Whilst she was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great enthusiasm; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affeclion; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before penetrated into his imagination that there was an evil power rosident in this country, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and pleaded, that his character was dreadfully vicissitude, for that the possession of irascible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more danger to society. It had been discovered, that his cravings for the adultress had not originated in any admiration of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratificatiion; that his victim, the parlner of his habits, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and debauchery: in consequence, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a fingle bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, proposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumslations pass unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the indiscretion of the daughter of the lady whose house he so frequently frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarrled female is accepted in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubry's eyes followed him in his windings, and soon discovered that an accusation had been made, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his having spoken about to murder her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would bear upon such an occurrence; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that on that morning he must duty accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other employment, and, calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify him of his concurrence to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's intervention.\\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stepstowards Greece, and crossing the Pecula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of distant glory upon monuments which apparently, intended for chronicling the deeds of men only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sholtering soil or mungily coloured lichen. Under the same roof as she herself, existed a being, so beautful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a person.\\nShe was bidding to preach on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had lost their souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped over the mountain's side, many would have thought the girl a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the arms, suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, origaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the conformation of her sylph-like figure. Often would the dust falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interrelation of a passage in Pausanias. It was innocence, youth, and beauty, uninfested by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate? Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in a the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would render all the superriatural effects of her profession. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often when she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and maintained intimate ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femme to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such ludicrous and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, having at once detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question his existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was intensified, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Mary; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women originally whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wove his thoughts; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Gael girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would learn himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon those around him, whom in his mind he regarded on image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was becouse she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in sketching or covering up some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with scrupulousness present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the placc, they all at once begged of him not to rot in it at night, as he would necessarily pass through a doorway, which no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They describod it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and described the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to disturb their peace. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to talk them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was seized.\\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his expedition unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to discover that his words, inocking the belief of such horrible fiends, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to part, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, before he allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that the day would soon end, and that in the horizon the sun was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed whatever delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and as he had advanced further, the power of the storm was abaited\\u2013its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of respite\\u2013its thick heavy rain sorced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue socked lightning seemed to fall almost radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The clanging at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that had recently lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brackwood which surround it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the peltings of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silencing, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockory of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, comforted him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \\\"Again baffled!\\\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\\u2013his adversary had himself upon him, and kneeling on his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\\u2013when the glare of lightning tearing through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\\u2013he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the snapping of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now raging, and Aubrey, capable of moving, was soon heard by those with him. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the fire lagged on every individual straw with heavy flakes on foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduetress lying in a lifeless state. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stilness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: \\u2013up her neck and breast was blood, and upon her back were the marks of the cutting that opened the wound:\\u2013Then one of the men pointed, crying, and simultaneously exclaimed in horror, \\\"A Vampyre!\\\" \\\"A VARNEY!\\\" A litter was quickly delivered, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her, who had lately been the object of so many bright and sairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were\\u2013his mind was benumbed and sereneed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\\u2013he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a paralular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by different persons who had been engaged in the search of her which a mother had missed. Their terrible cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. \\u2013To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inseparable; both died broken-hearted.\\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in at intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some uncharacteristic occurrence he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At her times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Richmond, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever molive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became Aubrey's constant attendant. When the lad recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon consoled him to his senses. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so upset Aury; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again degenerated into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intent upon him, with a smilo of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apperently engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like round the world, the moving sands;\\u2013indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was as much a lover of soliloude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he went near it near the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's forin stood by his side\\u2014if he went in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underbrush, in quest of the mysterious violet; then suddenly turning away.\\nSeeing round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a knowing smile upon her lips. He determined to remember these scenes, every feature of which crumbled such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollision could be attached: but when they had passed from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to doubt these robberies, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, through, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for nearly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and the echoed report of feveral guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retraced for a moment the sheltering turn of the desile: but alarmed of being thus detained by a woman, who wither insultingly bade them advance, and being committed to unresisting servitude, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush for the safety of the commons. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Routhven received a blow in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces approaching him\\u2013his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\\u2013they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Russell's strength rapidly declined; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the circumstances about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance more than usual. Witness: -Assistance me! You may save me\\u2013you may do more than that\\u2013I mean not my life, I heed the dictates of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's bonour. \\\"How? Tell me how? \\\"I would do any thing,\\\" replied Aubrey. \\\"I need but little\\u2013my life ebbs and flows\\u2013I cannot expain the whole\\u2013but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain from the world's mouth\\u2013and if my death were unknown for some time in England\\u2013I\\u2014I\\u2014but life. \\\" It shall not be known. \\\"Swear!\\\" cried the dying man, raising him fist with exultant violence, \\\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all thy nature sears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from the sockets: \\\"I swear!\\\" said Aubroy; he sunk down. He threw himself upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not what to do; when he awoke an oath of cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something terrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a rober met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by his friends and comrades, upon retiring, to the pinion of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his departure. Aubroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the interesting rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that pervasive melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a witness to convey him to Ortrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alaghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath opparontly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut\\u2013he shuddered\\u2013bastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\\u2013they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particulate form, the same varylling tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also small drops of blood on both.\\nHe left Smyma, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was almost convinced that the lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were ginning to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she be fore, by her infariline cares, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was till incapable attaching as a companion.\\nMiss Aubrey had that winning grace which went the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. The room had none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not soem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coruscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract\\u2014she was more arid pensive. When she came home, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she had destroyed in the rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thougth by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the new drawing-room, which was first appraaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \\\"busy scene.\\\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his sister, and fed upon the melancholy which overpawered him. He could not take interest in her. the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\\nThe crowd was excessive\\u2013a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of those round him, engaged in the remembrance that the last time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place\\u2014he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath.\\\" He had scarcely courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same fagure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first introduction into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his head. Lord Ruthven again besore him\\u2013circumstances started up in dreadful array\\u2013the dagger\\u2013his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible\\u2013the dead rise again!\\u2013He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossiblity that he could be restored; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a guard, he retired in a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he disguised himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to approach and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those fears he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of spectators who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in addressing them, he again heard that voice shout close to him\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath!\\\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\\nAubrey became anxious and distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complete was it engrossed, now that the possibility of the monster's living again presfed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his obrupt conduct. He only utlered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this man to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its disgrace? His wife might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembored, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaking with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the afternoon sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer able to be recognized; at first he returned with the alarm to his house; but at last he laid himself down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced from him who fled from a pursuer without giving him any thought. His conduct, however, sudden changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend almost upon them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Routhven approached with intimacy. When he entered into a room, his haggard and suspending looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at once obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a saciety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, seeing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again the measures which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\\nDesire of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they confidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind clogged by one terribleness after another. The incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapablo of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had assumed a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining played itself on the appearance of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her to touch him. \\\"Oh, do not touch him\\u2013if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\\\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \\\"True! true!\\\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherence became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its meaning, which first his companions observed, when several hours into the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awshome a situation, whc his sister was going next day to be married. Instantaneously. Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of his mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be preserit at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but waited a few minutes. He said his sister was with him. He was apparently again guilty of being affected by the influence of her affection, for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing from the thought of her brother's being more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the woman who had so long occupied his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\\u2013then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression on his countenance, he bade her swear that she would not wed this monster, for he\\u2013 But he could not advance\\u2013it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath\\u2013he turried suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entored, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\\nLord Ruthven had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with no one else. When he heard of Avrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from those from whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the bride and interest in his fate, he gradually won the affection of Mrs. Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount\\u2013could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with another being on the crowded earth, save to whom he addressed himself;\\u2013could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had come to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;\\u2013in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or what was the will of fate, that he gained her affection. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he offered an important engagement, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before her departure for the continent.\\nAubrey, when he was left by the physioian and his friends, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their bride and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heauy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubrey, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest in the confines of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of some terrible preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hooke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the prisoners at last overcame their vigour, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he made immediate approach, and, taking his arm by force, hurried away from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brother to day, your sister is honoured.\\\" Women are frail!\\\" So soothing, he pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not having subsided, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\\nAubrey's weakness improved; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near prospect of death. He desired his sister's guard flags might be omitted, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\\u2013he died immediately after.\\nThe guardians endeavoured to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had suddenly appeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the house with a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\\\"The world was all before him, were to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\\\"\\nIN Sailing through the Grecetic Coast Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1892, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of the same name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ship's bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cove called Homer's School, and other places, which we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \\\"He engaged me as a pilot,\\\" said the Greek, \\\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belonged to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six shundrod zechines for it, (about \\u00a3250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not always; for he sails in his boat very often to the different islands.\\\"\\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\\u2014an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all perfectly decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble lables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a large fountoin beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning post; a large ochouch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an emply book-case: there were no medals, nor a single painting. The bedchamber was merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow\\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Schapcline's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klapsloek's Messiah; Kotzebue's novols; Schjller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Groek press at Constantinois, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with remarkable notes, written with penmanship, in Hebrew and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\\nThe old man said: \\\"The lord had been read.\\\"\\nHe had these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\\\" said he, \\\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\\\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought back from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\\\"\\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen feet wide, and the fluted masonry pilasters with half-ack plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considered somewhat higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking light wines, known as \\\"lachryma ehristi,\\\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\\nOn his left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large oak hushes, a marble scat with an ornamental wooden back wall, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till nearly eleven o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \\\"I supposition,\\\" said the old man, \\\"praying\\\" for he was very devout, \\\"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\\\"\\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \\\"a bird's-eye view.\\\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covored with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Grange temple appeared in majestic splendour. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smoothes out, and an arch, surrounded by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, through a vista of lofty chesnul oaks and palm-traces, several smeltlands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \\\"The Armenian,\\\" said our conductor, \\\"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\\\"\\u2014\\\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\\\" said I\\u2014\\\"If I can,\\\" said he, \\\"I dare not.\\\" We had not time to visit the Armenians, but on our return to the town we learned severances of the imprisoned lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gives a cow to one man, two others, and ootton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we observed, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstantial circumstance we must mention, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and given her herself the use of it.\\nSuch was the infernality with which we parted from the peaceful Isle of Messina; our imaginations all on the run, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had much, it was evident: he had philarithropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriving at Parma, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \\\"The individual,\\\" said he, \\\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\\\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \\\"Childe Harold\\\" being put into our hands we recognized the name of Charles in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we confoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some other day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not wholly uninteresting, and in respect to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, indifferent to assimilation with human nature, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as may be plainly gathered from these dates. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat. He took his son in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to govern all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Rellgion hath set her seal, and over whose head Buckingham hath thrown her mantle. No one can read the preceding pleasuring \\\"traits\\\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with contempt, particular when directed against man's moral irrigrity; and he who dares justify himself for that awful tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errands of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his genius. Trying to do good in yourself, and shun the world's applause, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\\nTHE END.\\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.\",\n          \"THE VAMPYRE.\\nA Tale.\\nBy John William Polidori\\nTHE circumstance upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the estitution of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a living body could not corrupt those married in their territory, it gradually acquired, and formed the subject of many well-known stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feoding upon the blood of the young and beautified. In the West it spread, with considerable variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyres night imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptives; while those human blood-sucker's fangs became distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreygo, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a regimentary Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a monster, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the monster's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his habits. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted the doctor Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reputed to have crumbled as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, buried his body, and put the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents against others who survived them.\\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a monster becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\\nChief bailiff.\\nThis monstrous scene is here related, because it seems better adapted to Illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other form which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only compelled to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most upon earth\\u2014thos to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \\\"Gospel.\\\"\\nBut first on earth, the Vampyre sent. Thy corse shall rest in its tomb until death; Then violently haunt the sacred place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at night drain the stream of life; From the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon of their sire; As cursing thee, thou musting them. The flowers are withered on the stalk. But know that for thy own sake must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name\\u2014That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy sorrow and mark her death's last gasp\\u2013her eye's last spark, and her last glassy glance from a view which freezes her lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow bair, which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn\\u2013 But now it is torn away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and bagging lip; Be stalking to thy sullen grave, Go down with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these irredeemable horrors shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\\nMr. Southey has so introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \\\"Thalaba,\\\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have stemmed from the sinfulness of her life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several extraordinary cases of vampirism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmel, in his great work upon the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives of its effects, has put forth some learned dissortations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbarian error.\\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singular and horrible occurrence may be added; though the present may suffice for the limit of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, which cannot now be concurred by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general application, there are many others synonymous with it, made usc of in various parts of the world: as Vravoccha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\\nTHE VAMPYRE.\\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, he had appeared at the mostrious parties of the leaders of the city, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon them all around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only increased his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw himself into the breasts where thoughtless assaults occurred. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead gory eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the hearl; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighedupon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited into every house; many wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a stranger's notice, apart from the blurring of rnodesty, and from the strong emotion of passion, though its features and outlinewas beautiful, many of the femole hunters of notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inspiration of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:\\u2014though in vain: when she stood for him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it soemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappeasable impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common advice could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was to do with the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtue, as among those who value it from their vices.\\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left aloof to him by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they neglected the more important charge of his maintenance and the care of medical subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of nobility and candour, which daily ruins so many inilliners' apprerituations. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that virtue was drawn in by Providence merely by the peculiar aspect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were more adaptable to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colour patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whither should deseribo with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by the brightening countenances wen he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when they touched his lips, had led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary pursuits, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presenoo of a ghost, but from want of light, there was no foundalion in real life for any of the composes of pleasing pictures and scripts contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man enlirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other indications of his observation of external objects, was the chief objection to their exiftence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to capture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the object of a romance, and determined to obey the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his acquaintance, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually intimated that Lord Ruthven's offices were occupied, and so found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, the address he was about to rent. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to proceed on the tour, which for some general purpose has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vices towards puttingling themselves on an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the heaven, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subject of pleasantry or as praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately afterwards mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apperently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now found, that, though many more of his actions were expored to his view, the circumstances offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was only upon the voracious, reduced to weakness by the misfortunes attending even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer; but when the profligate came to him for something, not to relieve his wants, but to enable him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chivalry. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the more indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed upon his mind: all those persons upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the scalded, or doomed to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns when they passed, Avrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cudgels of all fashions; there he entered into all the spirit of the table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and when he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging seance, with which he germinally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encouraged the rash youth of a novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wisb seemed fortune's law\\u2014this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sporkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hapless mouse. In every way, he loft the formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. He took no money from the gambling table; but immediately last, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might be the result of a certifying degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it\\u2013for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, arid amidst the various wild and dramatic scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke louder than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from him than the conviction of finally being able to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily observation upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whom he went to search of the memoranda of another almost deserted country. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with eager excitement; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but agony; the others were from his companions, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residuated in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason to hold the belief. His guardians insisted upon him immediately leaving his friend, and contended that his character was dreadfully ugly, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduction, render his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in diminished character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the principal of his guilt, should be degraded from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abysm of infamy and degradation: in fact, that all those females whom he had sought, apparent on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole depravity of the institution to the public gaze.\\nAubrey retired from the court, leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and there perceived that his Majesty was endeavouring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly occupied. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried woman is met with respect in society; he was before obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Avrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appainted, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Loosing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abrupty asked him his intentions with respect to Mary, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very evening. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were much as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey relented, and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship on the remainder of their proposed tour, ordered his servant to seek other offices, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of a fact he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the charactor of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Routh next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stops low in Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory up an monuments that apparently, accused of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering sail or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have been the model for a pajnler wisbing to pass on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much red for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle the poor type of her beclown.\\nFor who would have exchanged her eye, apparently an eye of an affectionate nature, for that sleepy curious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an animal companion? The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often saw the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her farm, floating as if were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced lace, in the contemplation of her sylph-like features. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibiting in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his memory the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interrelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why should we describe charms which all feel, but none appreciate?\\u2013It was innocence, you know, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling conditions. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to proserve a memorial for his surgical hours, she would stand by, and witness the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the outlines of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plains, would point, to him in the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidenty made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural habits of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the envious morris, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of idle and harrble fancies; but she cited to him the cases of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after some of their near relations and children had been found marked with the marks of the fiend's appearance; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof. Given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to concede it was true. She detailed to him the regular occurrence of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lord Rulven; he, however, persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Harriet; her innocence, so controsted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an educated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for same antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that occupied alone the most powerful portion of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always considered to part from him with reluctance; but it was clear that she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her husband was occupied in stealing or destroying every fragment which had yet escaped the destructiv hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with severance, affirmed their belief, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his exoursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to roturn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, which no one would ever reach, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described him as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a fuperior, infernal weapon, the very mention of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was saddened.\\nOn Sunday morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to behold the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the folly of those horrible spirits, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to deport, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his work, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was of one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all the fury upon the devoted country. He al last, bowlegged, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twelve o'clock, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, darkness begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above\\u2014its violent thunders had scarce ceased, and an explosion of resounding roars and heavy roars forced their way throvgh the canopying foliage, whilst the blue fog seemed to fall and radiate at his very fect. Suddenly his horse look fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The engine at last, through great difficulty, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardy lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approched, hoping to persuade some officer to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the suppressed, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled, but, roused by the thunder which clogged rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found him in utter darkness: the sourdough, however, guided him. He was apparently unporceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in communication with someone, whom he immediately recognised, when a voice cried, \\\"Agairi basfled!\\\" He felt himself grappled by an opponent whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with considerable force against the ground:\\u2013his enemy threw himself upon him, and knelt upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat\\u2013when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;\\u2013he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now fierce; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those near. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch lusted on every individual straw with heavy flake of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fiancee brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, believing that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he then saw the small form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:\\u2013upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having apened the vein:\\u2013to this the men pointed, crying, and simultarieously struck her, exclaiming, \\\"A Vampyre!\\\" \\\"Vompyre!\\\" A crowd was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had always been to him the object of so many joys and fairy tales, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were\\u2013his mind was overwhelmed and seemed to sink into reflection, and take refuge in vacancy\\u2013he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by other parties who had been engaged in the search of her when a bullet had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parerits of same dreadful catastrophe. \\u2013To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a first violent, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ian; by some unaccountable combative he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever reason, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startedled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, by his kind words, impinging almost repentance for the folly that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship had quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed directly upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was almost exclusively engaged in watching the tideless wavings created by the cool morning breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling our world, the moveless sun;\\u2013indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\\nAubry's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once distinguished him seemed to have deserted him for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silerice as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; and when he sought it close to the ruins he had formerly frequented, Antoinette's form stood by his side\\u2014if he fought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the verdantwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smirk upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every scene of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had hitherto seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be obtained: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose only interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a regiment. Upon entering, through, a narrow defile, the base of which was the centre of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had cause to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the reply came. Lard Ruthven and Arnold, imitating their comrades, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being surrounded by a fiend, who with insulting shouts bade them advice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb out and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the hold of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him down on the ground. Aubrey became accustomed to his situation; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\\u2013his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown down their arms and surrendered.\\nBy promise of great reward, Aubroy soon induced them to take his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence than they being constituted merely to guard the entrance till their employer should return with the promised sum, for which he had given order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly declined; in two days mortality ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as aware of pain as he had been of the effects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent uneasy, and his eye became fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with his usual earnestness\\u2014\\\"Assist me! Assist me!\\\" You may save me\\u2013you may do more than that\\u2013I mean my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, my friend's honour. \\\"How? Tell me how? \\\"I would do any thing,\\\" replied Aubrey. \\\"I need but life\\u2013my life ebbs apace\\u2013I cannot explain the whole\\u2013but if you would conceal all you knew of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\\u2013and if my death were known for some time in England\\u2013I\\u2014I\\u2014but life. \\\"It shall not be known.\\\" \\\"Swear!\\\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \\\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all that your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whomever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \\\"I swear!\\\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and uttered no more.\\nAubrey relished to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances atteriding his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he awoke his eyes a coiling shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpso, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and associates, upon his retiring, to the property of a neighbouring man, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to cut it up and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he went to the spot he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the prisoners swore they pointed out the exact rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, and intimated that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\\nWeary of a number of circumstances in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten the superficial melancholy that had sezed upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rutbven. Among other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Upon turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the hut\\u2014he shuddered\\u2014hatching to gather further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may he imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\\u2013they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the paralular form, the same varying marks upon the haft and blade were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; here were also drops of blood on each.\\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to seduce for Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the dissolution of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost overwhelmed with so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that the lady had fallen a victim to the depravity of Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the posts, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; but the breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, struggled to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, the memory of the past. If she befare, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still only attached as a companion.\\nMiss Avbrey had not that striking grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the love of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy character about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some foeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter future. Her step was on that light footing, wither strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract\\u2014it was sedate and penitent. When alono, her face was no longer brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then paying in the language of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deferred until her brother's return from the service, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \\\"busy scene.\\\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest in the frivolities of fashion and strangers, when his mind had been so lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\\nThe crowd was excessive\\u2013a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to see the smile of royalty, hastened to see it. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place\\u2014he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice her name, recognized too well, sounded in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath.\\\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, from a little distance, the same spectre which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed down, his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were draining from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\\u2013circumstances started up in dreadful array\\u2013the dagger\\u2013his oath\\u2013He roused himself, he could not believe it possible\\u2013the dead rise up!\\u2013He thought his imagination had cornered up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real\\u2014he determined, therefore.\\nHe refused to go again into saciety; for he ought not to know anything concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurting upon his lips, and he had not succeeded in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a distant relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, that many were coming, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in engaged conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with powerful step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself pushed by the crowd of spectators who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in struggling them, he again heard a voice whisper close to him\\u2014\\\"Remain your oath!\\\" He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\\nAubrey became extremely distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's coming again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he bought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he really to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and close his chambers, who would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that irrelevance which haunts him. His dress was neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any\\u2013froin thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose character they were unconsciences, he determined to enter again into society, and they watched him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven appraached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his bagging and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward disturbances so visible, that his sister was compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which clung to him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardian thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been foisted upon them by Aubrey's porents.\\nDesirous of protecting him from the injuries and suffering he had daily encounter with in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so complete was his mind absorbed by some terrible circumstance. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had come emaciated, his eyes had attained a glasfy lustre; the only sign of affection and recrimination remaining displayed itself upon the enceinte of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that frequently afflicted her, he would command her not to touch him. \\\"Oh, do not touch him\\u2014if your love for me is aught, don't go near him!\\\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \\\"True! true!\\\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incidences became more frequent, and his beard fell off a portion of its length, whilst his guards observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan upon the melancolic circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelligence, of which they feared he had not hitherto disclosed, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in company, Avrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her husband's being once again subject to her feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and appearance as herself; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at seeing the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her\\u2013then seizing her hands, and gazing upon her with a frantic expostulation of countenance, he had her swear that she would never wed this man, for he\\u2013 But he could not advance\\u2013it seemed as if that oath again bade him remember his oath\\u2013he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought it was but a turn of his disorder, entered.\\nBy and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, decided to prosecute him, and retired.\\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual bearing no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed him; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how from the serpent's art, or from was the will of fate, that he gained her afflicions. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardian, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to which he surrendered but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would destroy it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mother of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of crosstabs broke up the night. Aubroy grew more frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, and they gradually went away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. On the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\\u2014\\\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\\\" So saying, he pushed him towards his companions, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support him; his rage not letting vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the prisoner was accused of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\\nHenry's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symploms of the near approach of death. He directed his sister's guardians to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused\\u2013he died immediately afterwards.\\nThe guariffs endeavoured to apprehend Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rulhven had disappeored, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\\n\\\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\\\"\\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Malinci in the island of that name. The forbearance of his place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it\\u2014both men of war and merchantmen; and since it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyma, its hounds must repay for the deviation of a lane. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the country four days previous to our arrival in his country. \\\"He engaged me as a pauper,\\\" said the Greek, \\\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not chooso to quit Mitylene, where I am like to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zeroes for it, (about \\u00a3250 English currency,) and he resided there about four months, but not constantly; for he \\\"sings from his cottage very osten to the different islands.\\\"\\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the manor. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor: an entrance hall, a dressing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, marble columns on either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by means of a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a learning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnishing. In the hall stood half a dozen men.\\nThere were two cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were no mantillas, nor a sirigle painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottori quilts and a pink pillow\\u2013the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large servant's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining its contents. On the tablet in the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakespeares's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Rules of Engagements; Zimmerman, in the German language; Koczula's Messiah; Kotzebue's Riovels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradje Lost, an Italian edition, produced at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constanciople, much read, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\\nThe old man said: \\\"The lord had been reading these books some time before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\\\" said he, \\\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing about orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\\\" I once did him a service; and I have taken the produce of this farm far the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\\\"\\nThe appearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black pinnacles and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, known as \\\"lachryma chrismas,\\\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapevillas, orange and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the fiefdom of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evening and nigh twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \\\"I suppose,\\\" said the old man, \\\"praying\\\" for he was very devout, \\\"andways attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\\\"\\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \\\"a bird's-eye view.\\\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, surrounded with olive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smoothed as glass, and almost unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty cypress and palm-lifts, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bonker, who had gone to Candia. \\\"The Armenian,\\\" said our conductor, \\\"cauld not, but I ain sure ho will riot,\\\"\\u2014\\\"And cannot you tell, my friend?\\\" I said I\\u2014\\\"If I can,\\\" said he, \\\"I dare not.\\\" We had not time to see the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt something particular of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the royal feast. He gave a cow to one child, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he afterwards gave Groek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to, from all we learned, to have been a very eccentric or benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought prudent not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her husband the use of it.\\nSuch was the intensity with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all over the rack, wondering how this rammer in Grace could he. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Follicing in company with Mr. FOSTER, the clerk, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \\\"The individual,\\\" said he, \\\"about whom you are so anxiously concerned, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\\\" We had never then heard as his name's same, as we had been some years from home; but \\\"Childe Harold\\\" being put into our hands we recited the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to M'Lellan on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unseeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may beplainly gathered from the little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so cleaver deposed in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderriess, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevento has thrown her mantle. Noman could not read the preceding pleasing \\\"traits\\\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not have a right to give an opinion. Report's are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself must face the awful tribunal where all must appear, and must publicly censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous mind and self-approvirig conscience.\\nTHE END.\\nGillett, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

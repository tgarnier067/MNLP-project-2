    "0": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this site is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabjans itappeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greok churches; at which time, the idea of becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not correct if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding uponlhe blood of tho young and beautiful. In the West itspread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even from\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to have accurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of this place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been referred to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the friends of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj 1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grove, This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and foorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out colds dreadfully as he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the bases into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously decided from a varnpyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become confident than others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, arid sucks in his turn.\nChlef, a bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observation than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after doatb, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom be bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck thc blood of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet latbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living corse,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, Shall know the demon for their fire; As crs But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in the flaine! Yel thou must end the task and inark Her c heek last tinge—hor eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freozes over its lifeless blue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock where sborn Affectction's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then talking to thy sullen gravc, Go—arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till there in horror shrk away from space more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey hcls also introduced in his wild blue heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vompyre force of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn, which best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournament gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work upon this subject, besides the avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of just effects, has put forth some learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffiee for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the leaders of the ton anobleman, inore remarkable for his singularities, then his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might be by a loak quoll, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awelcod nat clean whencc it arose: some attrihuted into the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused a bim to be invited to every fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of en nui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue of his focus, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhueld in his way, and did all but put an dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice :— thoughin vain :— when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as lf they were unperceived ;— even her unappalled  But though the common adultress could not inflvence everi the guidance of his eyos, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even outercarned the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to take care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with nature, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the tasting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in a sine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and right: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bimstriving which should describe the least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nothers at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talent and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in bis gratified vanity, he was able to realize his dreams, when the extraordinary being we had above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tb vory impossibility of forming an idea of the charocler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of hif obseruation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his irnagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the ber0 of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his He became acqv ainted with him, paid him attention, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his present was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informalion respeeling this sirigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, though it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been troughly necessary to enoble lbe yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the oged, and not allowing them to appear as if falleri froin the skies, whenever scar They consented: and very immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-!\nttered by such a mark of speech from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profligate carne to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his ini This wos, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more pressed upon his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the seaffad, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjct mystery. At Brussels and other owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered into allthc spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet to take no money from this gambling table; bvt immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatiring the eunning of the more exp-\nct: a friend. Aubrey often wishes to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not terid to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he helped his friend to give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break that rnystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assumo the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost desertod city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him a sufficien reason for the belief. His guardians insist upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discoured, that his contempt for the dultress had not originated in hatred of hercharacter; but that he had required, to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, ho\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was undeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fellowedhim in all his windingf, and soon discovered that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, which would most likely and in to ruin an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intenlions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that was aware of his being about to meet her thal every night. Lord Ruthven answered that his inlentions were such as he supposed the call would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must describe accompanying his leadership in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his service to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his script to notify his complete answer to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, existing being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass to promise hope osthe saithful in Mahomets paradise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plant, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of hcr becluties; for who would have exchanged hcr eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, sloatiring as it was upon the wind, to the eager gazc of him, who forgot the letters he had just decypbcred upori an almosl effaced talet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Oflen would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s unray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to present a memorial for her future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjocts that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the super Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited about the interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and her dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst being attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe cited him the She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and this horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, still persisted on persuclding her, that thore could be na truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to exccite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.\nAubrey began to attoch himself more and more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and while he ridjculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes from her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention to the rvins around him, which in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to correct him with roluclarice; but it was because she had rio longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which was bad yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several prefent, affirmed their existence, people with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the place, thoy all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must nocessarily pass through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the rest of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade the light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his drawing thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind that his words, mocking the bolief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged him to return, where night allowed the power of these buildings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that doy-light would soon on, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and paur all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he had advanced far, the power of the starm wlf above—lts echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst the blue frorked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his eyes. Suddenly, his horse took a straight, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued iri one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently experienced; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of the film. He found himself in con tacl with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a uoice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and kneeling upon his breath, had placed bis hands upon his thraat, when  This storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mixed wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torches once make burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arisiring from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her focus that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, silently struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A lilter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him that object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take a refvge in vacancy—he held almost uriconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in this hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of beer when a mother had missed. Their calorie cries, also they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirjovs; in these intervals he would equal upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe—hy some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to sparo being hc loved. At other times, he would imprecote the maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her secretary. Lord. Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, iplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His leadership seemed quite changed; he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eonvalescerice began to he rapidly, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hirn, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo ha\nntcd him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless fun ;— lndeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eye of all.\nAbrcy's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could nat find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering almost the underwood, jn quest of the modest violet; then sudderily turning rovnd, would show, to hls wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile upon her lips How determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in a high mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound hy the tender care he had taken af him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greecneilher had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollectjon could be attacked: but though they thus hadlened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whosc interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence, if thus restricting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipiees, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcity were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the choed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had a gun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take lhom in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contact or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him —bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendored.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuens strengthrapidly depressed; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advanoing with hasty steps. His coriduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the object about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his asfistanoe with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied. Aubrey .—\"I need a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of ine, many honours were free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was on a train for some time in England —I — I — but life. \"—\" It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with excellent violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any world, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— If eyes were some bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nA ubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintoriee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered hlsooth, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he had left the corpse, when a robbcr met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself orid comrades, upon hif retiring, lo the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, aecording to a promife they had given his lordship, thal it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon thatrose after his death. Aubrey aftonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and buy it upon the spot where it says. But, when he had been mounted to the summit, he said no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they badly laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and iri, which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he res loved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied him in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal hvt—he shuddcred—hastening to gain further proof, he found a weapon, and his borror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though pocuiarly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed to be bound to lhe dagger; yct still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon lhe haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for d out; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Ro me, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the leave departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the positions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and which hostened to the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had a riot that winning circles which gains gaze and appause of the drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her believe, one was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvl from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was riot that light sooting, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her brother breathed.\nhed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her family for that of the uoluptary? It seems as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be a her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of a beer entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather be reinained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed up on the inelandboly which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frlvolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torri by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and also who were conscious of bask in the s mile of royally, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all around him, changed in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his oath .\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast hjm, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice to this spot upon his first entry into so cicty. He gozed till his limbs almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and foreing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. Hc paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances star-\nted up in a dreadful array—the dagger—bis oath .— He roused himsels, he could nal believe it possible—the dead rise agoin !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image hif mirid was rest-\nright upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. ct: He went a few nights after talking with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Preceiving, at last, that many were leaving, who roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister furrounded by several, apparently in earnest canversalion; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sword, and, with hurried step, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again heard that voico whispered to him —\"Remember your oalh !\"— He did not darcto turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.\nThe buyer became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the inonsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she introduced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His aath startled him ;—was he thought to allow this monster to roam, believing ruin upon his breath, against all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been taught by them. But even if we were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been knocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, for no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing skills and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, afraid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disappointed by him who fled from a pursuer sister than any — from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily charged. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to concentrate agoin into society, and watch a bim classly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when heentered into a room, hls haggard and suspicious looks were so st riking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offected them so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved navailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged aphysician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherenee became at least so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustrc ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the enlry of hissister; then hc would sometimes start, and, sejzing her hands, with looksthal severely afflicted her, he would dosire her not to touch her. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do riots go to the river him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, a riot even though she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the yeclr was passing, his incoherenees became less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, thal severcll t imes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe lime had nearly elapscd, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrcys being in so awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. InstantlyAubrey attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking if a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister here. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his first was with him. He was apparently again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her tohis breast, and kissed her cheek, wot with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to be feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmly, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long infuenced his life. He seized this portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramped just under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, arid gazing on her with a srantic expression of countcriance, he badeher swear thatshc would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade hirn rememberhis oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was In the meantime, the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the whole, and thought this was a return of his disorder, ent-\nered, and sorcing him from Miss Aub Grey, desired a hard to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, begged of them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, enderovured to pocify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. Where he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but where he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation andpleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Ho hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by correct attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and intorest in his face, he gradually wrote the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being ori the crowded earth, save with her love whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew ber, his exislonce, hadbegun to seern worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothiring aocents;— in fine, he knew so woll how to use the serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continct.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribo the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; hewrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own boriour, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o fow hovrs that rnarriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; bul giving it to the physicion, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the news is busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of the corriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost franlic. This curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, thoy gradually slole away, leaving a hirn in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm hy force, hurried hlm from the room, speechless with rage. When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride that day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So flying, he pushed him towards his talented ants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no loriger support himself; his ragenat firiding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he registered, as the physician was afraid of agiating her. The marriage was scolmnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisler guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related completely what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was also before him, where to chaos his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Greeian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certainly supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and though it lies rather out of the trapck for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engclged a young Greek as over guide, who told us he could come from Scio with an English lord, wbo lest the islarid sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a plot ,\" said to be Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was annoyed, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he has left an old mcln in charge of it: ho gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has reslded there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excitedour curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryrnan had resigned. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tables on the other side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, or a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. Ori the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rausseau works complete; Volley's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, but Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to revise one thing without orders, he would frown upon the rne for a week together; this other is very good. I oncedid him a service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin es which I paid to an aged Arrnenian who rcsldes in a small cottage in the wood, and whom l the lord brought bero from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico ln frorit was fifly paces Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pljnths and fret-work cor nices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were confiderably bigger than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine cherry earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the housesctops are thrown furnished, af upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enlered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed the party of his evenings and night till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for him was very devo-\njust ,\"and always attended our church twice a week, beside Sundays\".\nThe view from this seat is what may betermed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CalcIa, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until irl iri, the woads noarthe mountain base. The sea smooth as grass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, through a vista oflofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I felt enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Tbe Armeniari,\" said over the doctor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I con,\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not tried to visit the Armenian, but on over return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho hod portioned eight young girls when he was the last oven to the island, and the oven danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a newboat for a fishermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave GreekTestaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very energetic and beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the c cottage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the seaside, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the table rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and also those celebrities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our thoughts were dispelled. FaIlingin company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt andGreece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travels on the ifland of Tenedos, arid I also visited hirn at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chield Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on the overy page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we corisolcd ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships, a good crime, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, avcse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its forrows, or add lo just pleasures. The fact is directly to reverse, it may be plrily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, are elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking hjm cls a being on whose heart religion bath set her seal, and over whose head, Benevolence hath thrown her intotent. No man can read the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with a caut-\nion, particularly wheri directed against man moral integrity; arid be wbo dares juslify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "1": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE observation upon which this tale is founded also very general in the East. Among the Arahians it appears to be eommon: it did not, hawever, extend itsels to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greckchurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thala Lalin body could nol eorrupt if bvried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of money wondorful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their gravos, and feeding In the Wesl it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the bolief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these hum and blood-suckers fattened—and theirveins became distended to such a state of repletion, cls to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they politely and urianiinously afraid, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say that, at Cassavia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the vampyre, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grove, and This poor education, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a depositlon was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having confluted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in case of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptian, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fiorid blood. Proaf having been thus obtained, they resorted to accustomed energy. A stake will driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have ruined over as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This dono, they cut off his head, burned his body, arid threw the ashes into his grave. This same moclsures were adopted with the course of lhase persans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a computer himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief balliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is related here, because it seems better adapted to lustrate the subject of the present observation than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is consi dered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal situations solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the eorth, asVampyre serit, Thy corse shall from its lomb be rent; Then ghastly h aunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wifo, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yetloathe the banquet which perforcc Must feed thy livid living corsc, Thy victims, ore they yet expire, ShalI know the demon for Bul one thal for the crime must fall. The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheeks last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glanoe must view which freezes after its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed harid shall tear The lresses of her yellow hair, Os which, in lifc a lock when shorn Affectjon's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; thin gnashing tooth and hagg-\nard lip; Then talking to the fullen gravo, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in harror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey bos also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire curse of the Arabian maid Orieiza, whois represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of torinenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being promoted throughout the whole of the level of a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrifm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmot, in hif great work on this subject, befides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, but put forth some loarned dissertalians, teriding to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singlely horrible superstition might be added; lhough the present may suffice for the limits of a no te, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several other synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations otlendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than this rank. He gazed upon the mirror around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the sair onlyattracted his attention, that he might be by a loovell, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt the sensation of awe could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the temptation, did not seem to penetrate, and at any glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaderi ray that weighs upon the skin it would not pass. His peeuliarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the doadly hue oshis faco, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters af their notoriety attempted to win his attenlions, and gain, at least, same inarks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, But though the common adultress could not irifluence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent cautian with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew hc ever addressed himself to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it euon overcome the dread of his singular charocter, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico. He was as often among those females who form the boast of lhoirsex from their domestic virtues, as arnong thase who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Londan, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the rnore imporlant charge of his mind to the care of merconary subalterns, he cultivated more his iinaginatian than his judgment. He had, bence, the high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which daily ruiris so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympclthise with virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the piclurosque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage inerely consifted in the vesting of clotbes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon hif entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should deseribo with least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances wheri he aproachedled by their sparkling eyes, wheri he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ro monce of bis solitary hours, he started finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that slickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of sriuffling, there was no foundatian in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his sludy. Finding, however, some compensation in his grotified vanity, he was about to realize his dreams, where the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gauges fow other signs of his obfervation of objccts, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to plcture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this objoct irito the hero of cl romanco, and determined to observe the offspring of his He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advised upon his notice, that his person was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, still now, had only whetled his curiofity, he hinled to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enoble the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an eqvality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falen from the skies, whenever soandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry Does skill shewri in carrying them on? They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his interests to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found that, though many inore of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagobond, arid the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not even the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his olms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligclte came to ask something, not to relieve his warits, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous incident. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was stillmore impressedupon his mind: call those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the lhescaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which thoy passed, Aubr ey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which hls companion sought for the centres of all fashioriabe vice; thero he entered into all the spirit of the fara table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with some unchanging face, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash yovthful voice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortu nel's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than half of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluerit youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fale that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, omidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present crauing. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innoccnt: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, the problem of combating the ccurring of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleclsure which praved the ruin of all, and did not tend to bisown profit ;— but he dolayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak French and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthvenin his carriage and amidst the vari-\nus wild andrich scencs of nature, was always the same: his eye for less than his lip; and tbaugh Aubrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greclter gratification from it than the conftarit excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; be left home in the daily ottendonce upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eagor impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathing nothing but clffection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished hjm; jf it had become entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the helief. His guardians instead upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was droadfully uicious, for that the possession of irresistible power of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his conternpt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his viclim, the partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss af infclmy and degradation: in fine, that all those of males whom he should sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point ori which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some possible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and also let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with iri soclety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his wounds, and soon discovered that an assignalion had been appointed, which would most likely be found in the ruin of an innooent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthvenland abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lard Ruthveri answered, that his intentioris were such as he supposed all would have upon such an accasiori; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must describe accompanying his Lordfhip in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all be knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also honoring the character of his Lordship. The passing nation was proven. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete asserit to a soparation; but did not hint any suspicious of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys iriterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed bis steps towards Greece, and crossing Periinsula, soon found himself at Atbens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upori monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronieling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, bad hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicato, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on cariva ss the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think if he could belong to those who bad no fouls. As she danced uponlhe p 1 ain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for thethal sleepy luxvrious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicvre. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the veneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floclting as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would hertress be falling, as sbe flitted arourid, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hves, just might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind, every object be hod before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage inPausanias. But why can't tempt to describe charms with all feel, but none cari appreciate ?— It was innocent, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew thoseremains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and walch the magic effect of bis pencil, in tracing the scencs of her native place; shc would then describe him the circling ceremony, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing iri her infancy; and there, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression uponber mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her universe. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interesteven of Aubrey; and often asshe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of alovely female to prolang his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run oold, wbilst he attempted to lavgh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited him the names She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of those monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhuen; he, however, still persuading her, that there could be a rio truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to accept a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAuhrey began to attach himself more and mare to Ianthe; herinnocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; andwhile he ridieuled the idea of a young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming an aplan forsome antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix bif attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he reta iried an irnage that seemed alone the rightful possessor of this thaughts. The latter was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from bim with reluotance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilsl ber guardian will be occupied in sketohing or uricovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, afraid of their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubreydetermned to proceed upon one of his expressions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the narne of the place, they all at one begged af him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the dcly had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon the hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at bis daring thus to mock a superior, inf ernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Avbrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melanchaly face of his host, and was eoncemed to find that these words, mocking the belies of those horrible friends, hod j inspired them with such terror. When he was able to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnesly begged of him to return, the cre night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, to occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soori end, and thalln the harlzon there was one of those specks whieh, iri thick warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage on the deuoted country .— He at least, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed sor his delay: but it was too late. TwiLight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the slorm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced itself through the canopying force, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and reflected at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took the frigbt, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the encircled forest. The animals at last, through the satlgue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of Iightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and 6rushwood, which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the tower at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shriekf of a womon mingling with thestifled, exultclrit mockery of a laugh, continued in ono almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused hy lhe thunder which agairi rolled over his head, he, with a sudden esfort, foroed open the door of  He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of this. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by ono whose strength seemed fuperhuman: detcrmined to sell his life as dearly cls he cauld, he slruggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled upori his breast, had placed his hands on his throat—when the glare The storm was still now; and Aubrey, the incapablo of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches foll upon the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. Al the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his cyes, hoping that it was but a vision arifing from his disturbed imagiriation; but be again saw the same form, when being unolosed them, stretched by his fide. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacking as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon ber throat were the marks of toeth having opened the vein :—lo this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, arid Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been tohim the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now filled with a photo flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger or a particular construction, which had been sound in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, farewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAvbrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most uiolent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some uncountable combination he seemed to be a heg of his foreign companion to sparo the bcing he loved. Al other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avbroy, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his consultant attenda nt. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now combined with that of a Vompyre; bul Lord Ruthven, by bis kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault thal bod caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconolled him to his presence. His worship seemed quite changed; he no longer appcared that apathetic belng who had so aftonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalescence began to he rapidly, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meel his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicjous oxultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted During the last stage of the invalid recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs,circling, like our world, the inoveless suri ;—irideed, which appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of soljtude and silence cls Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could nat find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins, he had farinerly frequonted, Ianthes form food by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to h He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he beld himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had seen. They travelled in every direction, and saught every spot to which the collection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, they soemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In the consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jnh-\nabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guide than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bcd of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from neighbouring preeipjces, they had a reason to repent their negl engine; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pa ss, whon they were startled by the whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In cln instant their guards had left them, and, placingthemselves behind the rocks, had begun to fire the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, returned far a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unrcsistling slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in therear, they deterrnined at once to rush forward ln search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his ossistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was so surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately lbrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great roward, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring oabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content morely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which they had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty stops. His coriduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but little —rny lifo ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conccal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth —arid if rainy death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying rnan, raising himself with culta nt violerico ,\"Swear by all your soul reveros, by clll your nature foars, swear that, sor a yeclr and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rifing early in this morning, be was about to enter the hovel in which he bad left lhe corpse, when a robber mcl him, and informed him that it was no loriger there, baving been conveyed by himself and oomrades, upon his retiring, lo the pirinacle of a neighbouring mounl, according to a promise they had g given his lordship,thal it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey alumnished, and talking to several of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had maunted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was buried in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the c purse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had seized upon a big mind, he resolved to leave just, arid soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Noples, he could pick himsels in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Steven. Amongst other things, there was a cl case containing several weapons of offer, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggors and Afghanistan. Whilst turning them over, and cxaminiring their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented jn tbe samc flyle as lhe dagger discovered ln thefatoI hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that jl fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further eertainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the daggor; yet still he wished to disbelicve; but in particular form, some urying tints upan the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthueri's seduclive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruled, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilioris, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted bim to the English shorcs; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she became, by her infantine caresses, had married his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a meloncholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicalo a soul conscious of the abrighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a color may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed this result, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the vocabulary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face wore, then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, where he might be her professor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionahle slrangerf, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They were arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced of a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room bad only was held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had been Lord Ruthveri was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a vo ico he recognized too well, soon-\nded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He walked till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid of his thaughtswere bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in a dreadsul array—the dagger—hif ooth .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask cancerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in galning information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired from a recess, and he gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and reveared to him those features he most abhorred. He sprangforward, seized his fister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for theirlords; and while he waf engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. Is before this mind being absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrofsed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's atterilions were now needed, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupl conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more much thought, the more he was bewildered. His oclth started his m ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, am Idst also held dear, and riat avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his ownhand to free the world from such a watch; full death, he remembered, bad had already been moved. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sisler eame, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to he recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overlooked him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soori distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than cly—frorn thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struek with the idea that he left by hisabsence by the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of the hif oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from soeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wh en, hawever, remonstranoe proved unavoiling, the guardians thought proper to intorpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which should be before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandcrings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eyc those rnarks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to resist in the hovse, and take canstant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible object. His incoherence became in the last so great, that he was confined to his children. There would often lie for days, the lack of being roused. He had become emaoiated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recalling remairiing displayed himself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her honds, with looks that severely afflicted her, would desire her riot to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a slate, when she did not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year will pass, his incoheren became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observanced that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a dofinitc number, and then smile.\nThe time had rioarly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the year, no af his guardians entering his room, hegan to converse with his physiciari upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, where his sister was going next dcly to be married. Instontly, Aubreys attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this rnark of returning the intellect, of which they were deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, arid astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a sew, the ninutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again the capablo of being affected by the influence of her lovely sinile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her mother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak withall his wonted warmth, and to corigratulale her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a locket upon a black breast; opening a ll, what was a surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he asked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frclntic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that she would neuer wed this monster, for he— But he could not aduance—it seemed as if thal voiceagain bade. hjm remember his father — he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard both whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Misf Aubrey, desired beer to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, to begged them to delay, but for one day. They, altributing this to the insonity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, and a endcavourod to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from the hose among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, one, by constant attendance, and the pretonoe of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gra-\ndually won the ear of Miss Aubricky. Who could resist his powerless tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of bimself as of an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he clddred hjmself;—could tell how, since he knew her, hisexistence, had been to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing clccents ;— in fino, he knew so well how to use lhe The title of the elderbranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged slato ), which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempt to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuriring her, as sbe ualued her own happiness, her own horour, and the honovr of those nowin the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to haross any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without real to the busy inmates of the house; andAubrey heord, with a horror that may more easily be conceivedthari described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubroy grew almost a frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole away away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand was out of the room, and in a moment found bimself in the apartment where all were really scmbled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached him, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whifpered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and kn ow, if not my bride to day, your sisler is dishonovred. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards the host attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessol, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agiating her. The marriage was solernnized, the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAbrcys weakness increased; the expression of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grccian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbor of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit il—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargalning for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took aramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engclged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left this island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He arranged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mltylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, sacing the river, 6 elongs to bim, and he has the last an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred techniques for it ,( about L 25 o English curroncy ,) and has resided here for about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our euriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our country had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It can besisted of four apartinents on the ground-floor—ari entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all sirnply decorated: plain green-slained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning poslure; a largo couch or sofa compleled the furniture. In the half stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ease: there were rio mirrors, rior a slrigle pointing. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the sitting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were there in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shokspeares, Boileaus, and Rousseau works eomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germ ari langvage; Schiller's playof the Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Lost, ari Italian odition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greok press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian arid Latin. This Mesfiah was literally seribled all over, and marked with strips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he scolded, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his relurn; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except the twerity zechines which I paid to an clged Armenian who rosides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord hrought here from Adrianople; I don't know sor whot reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house actually was playing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plants and fret-work machines ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) wereconsiderably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an airing of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light winos, such as \"lochryma Christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lirnes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooderi back was placed, ori which we were to ld, the lord passed the money of his evenings and nights till twelve aclock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\" praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended over church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich virieyards led the eye to Mount Caico, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on thesummit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small storm issuing from the ruins descended on brokeri cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. These smooth as glass, and the horizon is unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates the view in front; and o little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-treef, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of cmerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than Idid this; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the name of the person who could reside in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bankcr, who had gone to Cand-\niathe. Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". Webad not the time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the law, we learn only several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the original feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to fathers, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these arliclef. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor child's children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Onecircumstance we learnt, though our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the tbelord was oftenseen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her o piano-farte, and taught her himself the music of it.\nSucb was the information which we departed from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramber in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, also our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxiaus, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaraIde\" being put into our hands, which recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our rosearches at this cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly sandered. He has been described as of ori unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdates. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his leadership poems, seems to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, sympatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for making him a cls a bcing on whose heart religion hath set her seol, and over whose head Benevolerice health thrown her mantle. No Indian can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him or a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are even to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before the awfultribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in the secret, and shun the world applause, is the worst testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "2": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Ar abians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until ofter the establishment of Christianity; and it has only ossumed its presont form since the divisiori of the Latin and Greek churohcs; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subjoct of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood In the West it spread, with the same slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and L0rraine, where the helief cxjstod, that vampyres nightly lmbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, loft their strength, arid speedily died of consuinptions; whjlst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their ueins became distended to such a stateof repletiorila\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrjsm, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had heard to say, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had been tormented by a vampyre, but This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by high attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be vsual in cases of vampyrism) frosh, and entirely free from correction, and emitting at the movth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomized remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they out of his bead, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had bad proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe uriiversal helief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observotions than any other inslance which could be advanced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his infernal visitations solely to lhase beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whorn he was bound by tief of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded lo in the \"Giaour\".\nBut flrst on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghostly haunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sjster, wife, At midnight draln the stream of lifo; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed tby livid livid living corse, Thy victims, ere tby y Bvt onothal for the crime most fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flaino! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye laslspark, And thelast glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhclllowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a look when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne awcly by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with their own best blood sbclll drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in horror shrink away from spectre inore accursed than they.\nMr. Southcy hos also introduced in his wild but beautifulpoem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned sram the grave for the purpose of tormenting bim she best loved witches in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innooence. The veracio us Tournefort gives a long account in business travels of several astonishing eases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratiues jllustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be coricluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of iri. various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, etc.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, if he could riotparticipate the thing. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awc, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whjcb, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrale, ond at one price to pierce through the inward workings of the heart; but fell upan the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; al wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engcling their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never galned a warmer tint, either from the blush of modosty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline wore beautiful, many of the female bunters after notorjety attempted to win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did allbut put on the dress of her, still it seemed as if they were unperceived ;— even her unappalled impudence wasbaffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his wife, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he had ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a win ning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcamo the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their do mestic virtuos, asamong thosc who usually it by their vices.\nAbout the somo timo, there came to London, a young gentlernan of the name of Avbrey: he was an ori orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquishod the more important charge of his mind to the cclre of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imcligation than his argument. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candaur, which daily ruins so many milllriers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with nature, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, af to see in romances: he thought that the inisery of a oottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, hut which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Ho was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his enlering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, slriving which should describe with least truth, their lclriguishing or ramping favourltes: the davghters at the same time as me, by their brightering countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickerod, only from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snufsing, there was a ria foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation is his gratified vanity, he was about to reinquish his dreams, where extraordinary being we have become deseribed, crossed bim in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho vory impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari lhe tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soori formedthis object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the perfon before him He became acquainted with them, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens asfairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from such notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to prove. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this slngular character, who, till now, had only whetted bis curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations have he thought necessary to enoble the young to take some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if folleri from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleafantry or of They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteecm from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHilherto, Avbrey had had no opportunity to study Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions wereexposed to his view, the results ossered different coriclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was profuse in his libercllity ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his child more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the vlrtuous, introduced to indigence by these misfortunes. attendanl even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardlysuppressed sneers; but when the profligale came to afk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This was, however, altributed by him to the greater imporlunity of this vicious, which generally prevoils over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curfe upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brusfels arid other towns though which lhey passed, Auhrey was surprised at the apparent oagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vioe; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharpcr was his antagonist, and then he lasted even more than he gained; but it was always with the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungean, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst the speaking looks of more hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, whether to buy even suffloient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tablc; but immcdiately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gil der he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was nol, however, capable of combating the coining of the more experienced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in hif carrioge, and amidst the varjous wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: hiseye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was remarking the object of bis curlosity, he obtained no greater recognition from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination b egan lo save the appearance of something supematral.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countoss, whilst he went in search of the inemorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was also engaged, letters orrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aslonished him; if it had become entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adullress had not originated in hatred of hor character; but that he had re quired, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of bis guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsulled virtue, down to the lowest abyssos infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femcl les whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resalued to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. Heentered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was erideovouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly requested. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of on the innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, I really laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that srom that moment must decline accornpanying his Lordfhip in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The ofsignatian was proven. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his p 1 and having been foiled by Aubreys interpasitian.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Penirisula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied biinself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the de eds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roos as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, savo that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plairi, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought that gazelle was a poor type of her bcauties; for who would have exchariged her oye, apparently the eye of an unimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncansoious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letlers he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylphiki figure. Ofton would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibjt in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the anliquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but rione can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and becluty, unaffccted by crowdeddrawing-rooins and stifling balls. Whilst hc drew those remains of which he wlshed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effeots of his penoil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circle dance upon the open plairi, would pairit, to him in all the glowing ealours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her lnfancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made cl greo Her earneftness and apparent belief of what she riarrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upan the life of a love ly female to prolong his existence for the erisuing months, his blo od would run cold, whllst be attempted to laugh her out of such idle and borrible santasies She decided to bim the traditional appearance of these monstcrs, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persifted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same lime hc wondered at that many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the superriatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the wornen among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won bis heart; arid while he ridicued the idea of a young rnan of Eriglish habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost sairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but be always found it impossible to fix his attitude upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retairied an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The latter was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from bim with reluctancc; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could vis it her favourite habits, whilst her guardian was ocoupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which hodyct escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to herparents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with a several present, affirmed their existence, played with horror at the very name. Soon aster, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his oxcursions, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever be main, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the uompyres jri their nocturrial orgies, and announced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him who dclred to cross their palh. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set oss upon his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly beggod of him to return, ere right allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that did not perceive that doyllighl would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their circle upon the dovoted country .— He lost last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders bad scarcely an iriterval of rest—its thick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foliage, which the blue froze lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took the flight, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last through fat-\niguc, stoppod, and he found, by blue glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the mafses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusling to obtainshelter from the pclting of the form. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, c continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the tbunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: sourid, however, guided him. He was apparently unpereeived; for, though he ealled, still the sourids continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a uoice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and be felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his lise as dearly as he could, be struggled; hut it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when lho glare of many torohes pe The story was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch laadod on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was ogain left in darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy from his fair conductrefs broughl in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he agairi saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colover upon her cheek, not even upon ber lip; yet lhore was stillness about her face thal seemed almost as attaching as tho life that once went there :—upon her rick and breast was hlood, and upon her throatwere the rnarks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horrar ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A letter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her wife had lately been to him the only effect of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost continuously in his hand, a naked dagger of a pa rticular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been logged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable critics, as they approached the city, forewarned parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but where they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the force. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrcy being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by someunaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprec ate millions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chance at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motivation, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant atlendant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, hc was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had riow combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance. for the foult that bad caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, soon reconoiled him to bis presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer crowded that apathetic being who hod so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his circle fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exullationplaying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have flod for ovor. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could nol find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; jf he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he soughl it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly lurning round, would show, to his wild imagin He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such abitler asfociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the lerider care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither hold yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and brought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to sell these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest just was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inbabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dosenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the nightbo-\nuring preciplees, they bad reason to repenl their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were stortled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the eehoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven on Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turri of the defile: bvt ashamed of being thus detalened by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and svrrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them toconvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, hc was no more distvrbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their compromise should return with the promised sum, for which he had a cln order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the morality ensuod, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconseious of pain as he bad belief of the objects about him: but towards the class of late last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofton fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earneflness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more that that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but yav may save my honor, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but little —my lise ebbs apace — I cannot oxplain the whole — but if you would concool all you know about me, my honour was free from slain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but lifo. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with an exultant video.\nIcnce ,\"Swear by all your saul treasures, by all your natural fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and bathod to more.\nAubroy retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold snorkeling came over him, as if from the presontiment of something horrible awaiting a bim. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had lest the corpse, when a robber methim, and infarmod him that it was na langer there, having been conveyed by himself and cainrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and talking to several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robb ers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they hadlaid the body. For a time, his mind wasbewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchically had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weclpons of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, arid examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samo style as the dagger discovered in the falal hut—he shuddcred—hasteriing to gainfurther proof, be found the weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when being difcovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no father certainly — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens' educational arts. Her parents were iri distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubroy's mind became almost broken under so many repealed horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the lionc. He became more and silent; and his only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to savo the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hiin to the English shores; and be hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine carosses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that long long grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There is none of that light brillioncy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the quality of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling wilbin, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterflyor a color mcly atlract—it was sedateand pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of July; bul when her brother breathed to her hls affection, and wauld in her pre-\nsince forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the last of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the space was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen yet.\nen, and had not been presented to the world, it was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when which might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"bvsy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not foel interest in the srivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the evenls he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own oomfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and also who were anxious.\nused to bask in the smile of royalty, hastencd either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly selzed by the arm, and a voice to recognize too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly courage to tum, feclrful of seeing a spectre that would be the last bim, when he peroeived, at a little distance, the same figure which had contacted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, be threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthvon again before him —oircumstarices started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imaginatian hod injured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; sor though to attempt to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a sew night after talking with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and eritering another room, and his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He fprang forword, soized his sister arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impoded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voiee whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thought. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she introduced him to explain to her what he had caused his abrupt conduct. He only gathered a few words, and this terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath stortled him ;—waf he then to follow this monster to roam, bearing a river upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remairied in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyef streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support the picture. At last, no longer the Japanese bearing stillness and solitude, be lest his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he was ndered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first, he returned with the evening to the house; but at least he laid him down to rest where fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were saon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of those presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, hif iriward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeling, for beer sake, cl society which affects him so strongly. When, bowever, remomentrance proved uriavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, feoring that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high tried to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upan lhem by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye, those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence became cold last so great, though he was confined to his character. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lvstre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, ond, seizing her hands, with l looks that severcly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch the bim—if your voice for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again be sank into a state, whence not even could be rouse him. This lost many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and hif the mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had narrowly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with his physiciari upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys bcing in so awful cl situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of reluming jritollect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intenlion to be present at the nuptials, and deciding to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, this sister was with him. Hc was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely family; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the lhaught of ber brothers being onco moro alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wanted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; operating it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monstro who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait and poroxysm of ragc, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus dostroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, arid gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not divorce — just seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthveri In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard this whole, and thought this was but a return to his disorder, entered, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, defired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, contributing this to the in sanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvcri had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he hoard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed an irisane, his exultation and pleasure could bardly be concealed from those making whom he had gained this information. He listened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hjs tangue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being ori lhe crowded earth, save with her to whom headdressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew hcr, his existence, had begun to seem worlhy of preservation, if it were mcrcly that he might listen to her foothing accents ;— in sine, he knew fo well how to use theserpents art, The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important einbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his doparture for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physieian and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen arid paper; it was given him; he wore a letter to his sister, oonjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honor, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would delvor it; but giving it to the physici, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rost to the busy inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morriing came, and the sound of the carriage broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost fantastic. The curiosity of the servants last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole the clway, leoving him in the cuftody of an belpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bourid waf out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: hc immediately approached, and, taking his arm by forco, hurriod him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the stair case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your death, arid know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not fin ding content, had broken a blood-uessel, and he was convinced to her. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he eritered, or the politician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was salemnized, and the bride and bridogroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardian might beoalled, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related to what theroclder had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven hod disappeared, and Aubreys sisler had got the trust of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE.\n\"The world will also before bim, where to choose his place of rest, arid Providence has a guide .\"\nIN Sailjng through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vesself, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certainly supply of cattle and vegetables always to be bad lhero, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and rnerchontmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We laridcd; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and wbilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with thenatives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small musical so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our gulde, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho ongagcd me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I was likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. Tbe cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to hiin, and he has lest an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sailf in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annoxed. They were all simply decorated: plain greeri-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneoth, which could be made to play through the branches by moulng a spririg fjed in the side of a srnall bronze Verivs iri a leaniring picture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dazen English chair, and an empty book-ease: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchomber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the commori held throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed cl rnarble recess, formerly, theald man told us, filled with books and papers, which were taken in a large female chest in the class: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exclaming the contents. On the table of the reeess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau warks complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobues novels; Schiller's play of the RabberslMiltons Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in I81o; several small pamphlets from the Greek prefs at Constantinople, much Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, the arid marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otherf; but,\" said he ,\" where they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, who would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small contract in the world, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen braad, and the fluted m arble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corriices ,( as it is now custamary in Grecian architecture ,) were considered higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine cherry carpel, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings, iri smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying ying lunch evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the sha de os two large m yrtle bushes, a marhle seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eyo view. ct :\"A linc of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in the bloorn, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the mosaic deeay. A small stream missing from the ruins descended in a broken cascadcf, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a l just on the 1oft, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several fmallislands were distinctly observed, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominlok, his banker, who had gone toCandia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am furc he will not ,\",\"And can you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said hc ,\"I dare only\". We should not continue to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learn several peculiars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new host for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamen to the poor children. In short, he replied.\nread to us, from all we called, to have been a very eccentric and beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-sorte, and taught her the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Groece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philosophy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about what you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited them at Milylene .\" We bad river their heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calclcl on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylone on the same future day; bul to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse toassoeiating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plairily gathered from those little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly dopicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness sym-\nathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and this courting to repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as o being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head, Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read thepreceding, pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give on opinion. Reports are ever to be received with corruption, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and when the world's applaufe, is the svrest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "3": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstilion upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extenditself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the decision of the Latin and Greek ehurches; al which time, the lead becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subjeet of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graces, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. In the West it spread, with someslight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, thal vampyres rightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suokers fatten-\ned — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curlous, and, of course, a critical account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungory. It appears that upon an examinalion of the commclnder-in-chief arid magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been he clrd to say, that, about five years before, a certajn Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been he clrd to say, that, about five years before, a certajn Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been This precclution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death arid burial, many people complained of having been lormented by a hirn, and a depofition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be useful in cases of vampyrism) fresb, arid entirely free from corruption, and cmitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and slorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven only through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, iri their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief ls, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nThe brief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observalions than any other instance which could be adduced. Iri many parts as Greece is considered as a sart of punjshmerit after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine bis infernal visitations solely to those beirigs he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded lo in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on oarth, as Vampyresent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rerit; Tben ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At mldnight drain thc stream os life; Yet loathe tbe banquet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere thcy yet expire, Sha The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best bloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's lasl tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand fhall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borncaway by the Memorial of thine agony! Yetwith lhine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the svllen grove, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till there in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutboy has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire curse of the Arabian rnaid Oneiza, who is represeritedas having returned from the grave for the purposo of tormenling him, she best loved what in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she has cing pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale of a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrate of its efforts, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious arid interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice sor the liinits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others fynonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parlles of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularilies, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the father only attracted his attention, that he might by cl look quell lt, and throw fear of those breasls w here thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: somc attributed it to the dead grcy eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pjerce through lo the inw ard workings of the heart; but fell upori the check with a loaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, arid those who had been occustomed to civil excitement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, ej lher from the blush os modesty, or from the strong emoliori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunlers after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lcldy Mercer, who had been the mockery of every insect. shewn in drawing ing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and dld all but put on the dress of a mountainebank, to attract his notice :— though in a clinic :— when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her, still it seemed as if they were unperceived ;— even her unappalled impudence was bofflod, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indlfferent to him: yet such waf the appa rent cautlon with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of cl winning torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who farm the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the passion of great we alth, hy parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his sortune, while they relquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of the mercenary scandals, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many million apprentices. He believed all to sympathife with virtue, and thought that vlce was lhrown iri by Providence meroly sor the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage mcrely consisted on the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, bvt which were adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay eircles, many mothers surrounded him, striving to describe with least truth through languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening contenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his llps, soon led him to falso nolions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to this romance of hif solitary hours, he was starlled clt finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot sram the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptians contained in those volumes, from which hehad formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified country, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossod him in his career.\nHe walched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other figns of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent tothor existence, implied by the avoidanee of their contact: allowing hif imagiriation to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soan formed this object intothe hero of a romanee, and determined to observe the offspring of his He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only wbetted his cvriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for hjm to perforin the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable lhe young to take some rapid stops in the career or vice towards putting themselves upon an eqvality with lhe aged, and not allowing lhem to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever sclandalous intrigue They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a propo sal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of osteem from hell, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to sludying Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found that, though many more of his aetlons were exposed to his view, the results affered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his literary ;—tho idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his band more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the daor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his lniqvity, he was sent away with rich char This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous legend. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which wasstill inore impressed upon his mind: also those upon whom it was bcstowed, inevltably sound that there was o cursc upon jl, because they were oll either led to tbescaffold, or sunk to the lowest clnd the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent cagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he betted, clnd always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; bvt it was always with the same unchanging face, wilb whicb. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn srom thecircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fierid; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to huy even sufficient to satisfy their present carving. Yet he took no money from the gclinbling table; but immediately lost, to the rui ner of many, the last gilder he had just sriatched from the canvulsive grasp of the innoeerit: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of eombating the curining of themore experienced. Aubrey often wishes to represent this to his friend, and beg him to rofign that charlty and pleasvre which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own project ;— but he delayedit—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and though Au hroy was near the object of his curlosity, he obtained no greater grati fication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted irnagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lostsight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almostdesorted city. What he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing bvt affection; the otherf were from his Guclrdians, the latler astoriished bim; if it had before entered into bis imagination lhal tbere wclsan evil power resident iri his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his unconscious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for lhe adultress had not originclted ln hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance hif gratification, thot his victim, the partner of his gvilt, should be hurled fromtbe plnnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degrodation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on aecount of\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resalved to invent some plausible project for abandoning hjin altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoliced. He cntered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly requested. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimorried femalo is mel with in society; be was therefore obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the Iady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very right. Lord Ruthven answered that these intentions were such as being supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he inlended to marry beer, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and immediately write-\ning a note, to say, that from that moment must decline accompanying his Lords hip iri, the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his seruarit to store other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed brother of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation of the present. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete answer to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Spain, soon found himself at Athens. He they fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that clearly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many ooloured lichen. Under the some roof as himself, existeda being, so beautiful and delicate, that she rnight bave formed this model for a painter wishing to pourlray on carivass the promised hope of the failhful in the mountain paradise, save her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the inountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchan-\ngive her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquiljes, and often would uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursvit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eagergaze of him, who forgot the letterf he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tab let, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delically brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why altempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawingrooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remairis of which he wisbed to preserve a memorial for his future hovrs, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling danceupon lhe open plain, would paint, to hjm in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, this marriage pornp she rememberedvicwing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that hod evidently made a greater impression Her eamestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him lhc tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearsl ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely feeling to prolong his existence for lho ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe clted to him She delailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by carrying a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in bear fears, though at the same time he wondered about many coincidences which had all lended to excite the belief in the supernotative power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to catch himself more ondmore to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wori his heart; and while he ridjculed the idea of a young man of English hairs, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before bim. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming cl plan sor some aritiquarian research, would depart,determined not to return until his object was altained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon theruins around him, whilst in his mind hc retained an image that soemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was conscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluetance; but it was because she had no longer one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelcbing or uncavering somo fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, said they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through wood, where no Greok would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their noeturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey madc light of their representations, and tried to laugh this out of the lead; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set aff upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy force of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, making the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was able to dopclrl, Iarithe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupted in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon and, and that in the horizon there was one of those spccks which, iri, the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he had advanced far, the power of the storm waf abovcc—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced ils quickly through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forkod lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismountiring, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting the obtairi shelter from the pelting of the slorm. As he approached, the thunders, sor o moment silent, allowed hlm to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was star tled: but, roused by the thunder which again ralled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperoeived; sor, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\" Again baffled !\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuinari: determined to sell hls life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—bis enemy lhrew himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands vpon bis thraat—when the gulce of many lorches penetrating through the hole lhat The storm was true still; arid Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch looked on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to peroeive the airy forrn of his fair deductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his dislurbed imagiriation; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was na colour upori her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaohing as the life that one dwclt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vcin :— to this man painted, crying, simultaneously slruck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A letter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was lloid by the side of her who had already been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take force in vacanoy—he beld almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by dissoront parties who had been engaged in the same arch of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable chief, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being pulled to bod was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthuen and upon Ianthe—by some unac countable combination he seemed to beg of his former coinpanion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever magnitude, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hiinsels in the same house, and became his constant ottendari t. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kirid words, implying almost repentance for the foult that had caused their separation, and slill rnore by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to help the presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no loriger appeared that apathetic being who had so astoriished Aubrey; but as soori as bis convalescence began to be rapid, he againgradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubreyperceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his laps: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hiin. During the last stage of the individual rocovery, LordRuthveri was apparently engaged in watching lbo tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;—irideed, hc appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys inind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once sa distinguished him now seemed to have failed for ever. He was now as much cl lover of folitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst lhe underwoad, in quest of the modest violet; then sudderily turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a black smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: blue. though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to need what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these re ports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose inlcrest it was to exercise the generosity of those who they defended from prelended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more than service as a guardian as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the hed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipices, they had the reason to repenl their negligence;far fcarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were slortled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthuon and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but asharned of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade lhem advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the rabers should climb above and take them in the roar, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; arid, no longer heeding the contest or his own poril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—hif guards hauing, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey foon inducted them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an arder. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the inortisication ensued, arid death feemed advancing with hasty steps. Hls oonduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apporontly uneasy, arid his eye aften fixed upon Aubrey, who wasinduoed to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Asslst me! you may save me — you may do more than that t — I mean not my life, I beed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I nced but little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole —bul if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I —butlife. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself withexultant uiolence ,\"Swear by all your soul revcres, by all your nature fearf, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed burstling from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he said laughing upon his pillow, and brealhed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; he many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not. why; when he remembered his oalh a cold shivering came avor him, as if from the presentation of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which had left the corpse, when cl robher met him, and iriformed hlm that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to be pinnacle of a neighbouring mountain, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and brave it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the ropes or the clothes, though the robhers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjeelures, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten the thal superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to correct him to Otranto, or to Napl es, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing severol weapons of defence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and otaghans. Wbilst turriing them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger difcovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the wcapon, and hif horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the shealb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to difbelieve; but the partioular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and shoath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snalch from Lord Ruthuenf soductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and the only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the positions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and hc hasleried to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, applied to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assomblies. There was none of that light brilliantly which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the Ievity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from the soine feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a bigger realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those gries she knew destrayed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the focus were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to this world. It was thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It wasnow, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities osfashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the family of royalty, hastened the thilher. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was founded in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that every place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and cl voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hard courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blasl hjin, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted this notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost reserved to bear their weight, who was obliged to take the arm of a cl friend, and forcing a passage through the eward, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driving home. He played the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he wore afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances started up in a dreodful array —tho dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could riot believe it pofsible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination bad conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his fister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He struck forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, sorced her towards the street: al the door found himself lm peded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lordsland while he was engaged in pafsing thcm, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Roinember your aath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sifterlsoon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much information completely was it eng-\nrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisters' attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what bad caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildored. His oath starlled him ;— was then to allow this monster to roam, boaring ruin upon his breath, almost all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a cold wretch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; sbut up in his room, he saw no one, and clte only whon bis sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capablo of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often explained to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last helaid him down to the restwherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, arixious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuance faster than any — from thought. His schedule, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of those presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered inlo a raom, his ha ggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings sa visihle, thal his sister was at Iast obligcd to beg of him to abstairi from seeking, for her fake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailiring, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thein by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye, those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and takestont care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was abforbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became in the last so great, that he was considered to his cbarnber. There he would often live for the class, the incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recolection remains displayed itself upon the entry of his sisler; then he would sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflictod her, who would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" clnd again, he ran into a state, when not even if she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his income-\nrences became less frequerit, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians ahserved, that several times in the day he would court upon his f ingers a definite number, and their smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians eritering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, where his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning iritellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey soemed pleasod, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present of the nuptials, and desire to see his sifter. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's heing once more alive to the feelings ofaffectiori. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to corigralulate her uponher marriage with a person so diftinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influericed his life. He scized the portrait in a paroxysm of ragc, and trampledit under foot. Upon ber asking bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantio expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But be could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meanimo, the guardians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, described her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged off the thing to delay the bill for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been confused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exvltation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former coinpanian, and, by constant attendance, found the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils that recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whomho addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew hor, his existence, had begun to seem worth of preference, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, which obtained an important embossy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place very doy before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician, arid his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. Hc asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sifter, canjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, arid the horror of those now in the grave, who onccheld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more than the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants of last overcame their ignorance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly afsembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his room by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the slaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your boat, and kriow, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he passed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessels, and he was conveyed to the body. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as physiciari, was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour was bad struck, he relatod profoundly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians had tended to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1821, we put into the harbour of Mityleno, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo and vegetables always have to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—botb men of war and merohantmen; and though it lies rather out of the trock for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the mcn were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homers Sohool, and other places, where we had been before. Ori the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greck as our guide, who told us which had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his festival. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I was likely to get married. He was an add, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about Lz 50 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not conslantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in the haslening house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlor, and a bod-room, with a spacious closel annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a learning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In this half stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchambor had more large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed colton quilts and a pillow — the co-mon bed throughout Greeco. In the sitting-room we observed amarble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Last, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English hook of any description. Most of these books were filled with marriage notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were romarks.\nThe old rnan said :\"The lord had been reading these books lhe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there thoy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, be would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm far from trouble taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeniari who resided in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for the whole reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was sifty pac es long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black paint and fret-work cornices ,( as just is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustradc, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are also furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, dr inking light wines, such as \"lachryrna Christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the ovening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borderf, and under the shade of two large myrtle houses, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were tol d, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve ooclock, rooding, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose she,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very donut ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich yellowards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, and on the suminit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decoy. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the wood near the mountain base. Tho fea smaoth as glass, and an borizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiriates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and plumtrees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a lot more than I did this; but our enquiries were frultless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Domlnick, his banker, who had agreed to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\" could tell, bvt. I am sure he will not ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" said I ,\"If I want,\" said he ,\" I dare not .\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lard. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cold cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fatherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric arid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage ought to be proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful side of MityIenc; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. Hc had more money it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those activities which inark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were difpelled. Falling in the company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said to be ,\" About whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travelson, the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at MityIene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on a very page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite unintcresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeoling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing to its diary way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little coincidences. All the finer foelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their soul in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a beginning on whose heart, Religion bath sells her seal, and over whose head Bencvolence hath throwri her money. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reparts are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrily; and he wbo dares juftify himself before that awsul tribunal which will appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-rnortal. Lord Byron's character is the warmth of his genius. To do good in fact, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-sleet.",
    "4": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Pojdori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has orily assumed its present form since the division of the Lotin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorralne, where the beef existed, that vampyres nearly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilft these human blood-suckers faltened—and their velns became distended to such a stote of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and\nIn the London Journal, of March ,732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occupied Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon ari cxamination of the commander-iriohief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affrmed, lhot, aboul fivo years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pclul, had beeriheard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vclmpyre, but had faund a way to rid himself of the evil, This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and busy trial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, the inhabitants having consuitted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (cls is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driver entirely through the beart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they could off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashef into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon the others who survived them.\nThe universal belief if a person suckod by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is bere rclated, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observation than any other instarice which could be adduced. In many parls of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, sor some helnous crime committed whilst in oxistence, that the deceased is not orily doomed to vampyrise, but crippled lo oonfine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he lovod most while upon eorth—those to whom be bound by ties of kindred and affectian .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on oarth, as Varnpyre scnty corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt tbenative placo, And suck tbenative placo, And suck tbenative placo, And suck tbenative placo, And suck tbenative placo, And suck tbenative placo, And suck tbenative placo, And suck tbenative But only that for the crime must fall, Theyourigest, besl beloved of allball bless thee with a father's riame — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou musl and the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—ber eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tell The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock when shorn Affections fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memor ial of tbine agony! Yel with thine own best hlood shall drip; Thygnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits r ave, TilI these in horror shrink away from spectre moro accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalclba\", the tbe vampyre oorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have rosulted from the sinsulness of her life, fhe being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefortgives a long account in hif travels of several astonishing cases of vainpyrism, to which he prelends to have been an eyowitness; and Calmet, in his greal wark upon this subject, hosides a varioty of anecdotes, and trodilionary narratjves illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, lending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barb\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded hy merely remarking, that tho ugb the lerm Vampyre is the one in most gencral acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: af Vrouc0locha, Vclrdoulocha, Gou \nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. Ho gazed upon the right around the bim, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laugher of the fair only ottracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those dreams where thoughtlessness resigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fjxing upon the object's focus, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leclden ray that weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wishes to see him, and tboso who had been accustomed to violent exoiteinent, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though il form and outline were boavtiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety altempted to win his attentlons, and gain, at least, sorne marks of whcltthey might term affeolion: Lady Mercer, who had been the moekery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, throw herself in his way, But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent coution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Hehad, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular charoct er, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form lho boast of their sexfrom their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while being was still in childhood. Left also lo himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortuno, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of meroenary surgeons, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought the thal vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, os which seo in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisled in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patohes. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, arid rich: for these reasons, upan hls entering into gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded hirn, striving which should describe with least truth, their languishling or romping fovourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenances where he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he apened bis lipf, soon led him into false notioris of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romanee of his solltary hours, he started at fjnding, lhat, except in the tallow cland wax candles that slickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life sor any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he badly formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed blm in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himsels, who gave a few other signs of his obscrvatiori of external objects, lhan tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture euery thing that flattered its proposition to extravagant idecls, he soon formed this object inlo the hero of a romance, clnd determined to obserue the ofsspring of bis He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the note of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of giving some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, bad only whetted his curiosity, hchinted that hisguclrdians, lbat just was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable lbe young to take some rapid steps in the tabe car eer of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, arid not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or They consented: and surely immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from a bim proposal to join him. Flaltered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\n The photo-\nrto, Aubrey had bad no opportunity to study Lord Rvthvens character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upan the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the proficiency came to ask som clhjng, nol to relieve his wants, but to allow hiin to wallow in his lust, or to sink himstill deeper in his iniquity, he was This was, however, contributed by him to the greater importuriity of the victims, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtue indigent. There was one circumstance about the capacity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all the citizens led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized to the apparent eagerness which they had been fougbt for the centres of all fashionable viee; there he entered into all the spirit of the farotable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchonding faco, with which he generally watched tbe socjety around: lt was not, however In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, lorn froin the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the folitude of a dungeon, the fclte that had drawn him within the reclch of this friend; whilst many a fother sot frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, withovl o sirigle farthling of his late immense wcalth, wherewith to buy even sufficient Yet he took no money from the gombling table; bul immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the last gilder he had just snatehed from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of eombating the cunning of the mare experienced. Avbrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and place which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak srankly and openly to him; however, thif never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carrlage, and amidst the various wild clnd rich soenes of nalure, was always the same: hls eye spoke less than his lip; clnd though Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification on from it than the conslonl oxcitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hif exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernalural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in a dally attendorice upon the morning circle of an Italian encounter, which he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserled city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sisler, breathing nothingbul affeclion; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. His guardlans insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was drea dfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his vicious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his conlempt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of her character; but that he hod required, to enharice his gratification, that his vlctim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled froin the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowesl abysf os infamy and degradcltion: in flne, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of \nAubroy determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest this eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, watching him more closely, and also let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly recovered. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarricd female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in seeret; but Aubreys eye followed them in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thoughless girl. Losing no time, he ontered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed the call would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retlred; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the reinainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seok other apartmenls, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The pronunciation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next dcly merely sent his servant to enjoy his completeo assentto separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself of Atbens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, asbamed of ehronjcling thedeeds of freemen only before slaves, held hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many col-\nour police phone. Under the same room cls himself, existed being, so beautiful and doljeale, that she might have formed the model for a painter watching to pourtray on canv-\nass the promiscd hope of thcfaitbful ln Mahomets paradjse, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to lhi nk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought he gazed at a poor type of her boauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of climated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in bis search afler antiquilief, and often would the vnconsciovs girl, erigagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere bvtterfl y, show the whole beavty of her form, floating as il were upon the wirid, tathe eager gaze of him, who forgot the lettcrs he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted arourid, cxhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excufe the forgelfuries of the antiquary, who letesccle from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanios. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciate ?— It was innocenoe, yauth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, sbe would stand by, and wotch the magic effects of hif pencil, in traoing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance to the open pain, would paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memor y, themarriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and 0ften as she told bim the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years almost his frierids, arid dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to p rolong his existence for the ensuing mariths, his blood would run cold, whilst attempted to laugh her os os os os, who had at She detailed him the traditional appearance of lhese monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; be, however, still persisted on persuading her, that thcrc could bo no lruth iri her fears, though at the same time he wondered if many coincidences which had also tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and inore to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the offecled virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hahits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarjan research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was clttained; but be always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind, he retained an image that seemed alono the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Then he was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infanlible being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite habits, which her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of timo. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impendingupon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw the lhern shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his exo-\nursion unattended; hc was surprised to observe the melancholy face of this bost, and was concerned to find that his words, mooking the belief of those borrible friends, had irispired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Iarithe came to the whole side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the harizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather irito a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at least, however, mounted his horse, determinod to make up by speed sar his delay: but it was too lato. Twilight, in these southern cities, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere ho had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interv al of rest—its lhick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying fatigue, whilst the blve forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal al last, though faligue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the themasses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thuriders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadsul shrieks of a woman mingling with lhe stlfled, exultant mockery of a laugh, conlinued ln one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the tbunder which agalri rolled over his he ad, he, with a sudden effort, foreed open the door of He found himself in utter darkness: sound d, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was a lack of bim. Hc sound hlmself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voioe cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed svperhuman: deterinined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but lt was in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled with enormous force ag against the ground :—his enemy threw himself The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch laded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey thoy sarcbed for her who had attracled him by her cries; he was agoin left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair cond uctress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was a vision arising from a hif distvrbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy villains, now selling with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—hif the mlnd was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and took refuge in vacaricy—he beld almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in this hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the fear of the ber whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable circles, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their gries would be impassible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolcable; both diod, broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Heaven and upon Ianthe—by some uriaccounlable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chonced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from a whatever motive, upon bearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, he was horrified arid startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon recognized him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathotic being who had so astonisbed Aubrey; but as soon as his convalence began to be rapid, he again gradually rotired into the same state of mirid, and Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inalicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hlm. During the last stage of the invllid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tldeless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progross of tbose orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elaslicity of the spirit which had been so distriguished him riow seemed to have fled sor ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished forsolitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought lt in the woods, ber light step would appear waridering ainidst thunderwood, in quest of a modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, lo his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meok smile upon her lips. He determined to fly the scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which cl recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed only to heed what they gazed up to. They heard muoh os robbers, but they gradually began to slightly these reports, whiob imagincd were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the genorosity of those whom they defended from prestigious dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of lho inhabitarits, on one occasion they trauelled with only a few gvards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipioes, they had the reason to repent their negligenco; for scclrcely engaged ln tho narrow pass, where they started by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guris. In an instant, the guards had left them, and, placing lheinselves behind the rock, had begun to fire in the direction when the reporl came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sbeltering turn of tbe defile: but ashamed of being lhus dctained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade thom advance, and being exposed to unresisling slavghter, if the army of the robbers should climb above and take thein in the rear, they determined at once to rush sorward in the sorward in the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heeding the contestor his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around bim—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great rcward, Aubrcy soon induced them to convey his wounded sriend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content inerely. a guard the entrance till their computer should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the olose of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was invited to offer his assistance with more than usual earneftness —\"Assist me! you inay save me—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence a little as that of the passing day; but you may save money honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free sromstain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried lbe dying man, raising himself with exvltantvilic ,\"Swoar by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and cl day you will not impart your knowledge of my dreams or death to any living bcing in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon this pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhreyrelired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oatb a cold shivering came over him, as is from lhc presontiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising oarly in the morning, he was about to enter lhe hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a robber mot him, and informed hiin that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise that he had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of themoon that rose after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the fummit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the fake of those clothes.\nWeary of a country iri which which had met with such terrible misforturies, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superftitious melaricholy that had seized upon a high mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convince him to Otranta, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprife at sending a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovcred in the fatcll hut—he shuddered—hastenling to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his harror may be imagined when he discovered that itfitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath heheld in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—thcy seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same uarying tints upon the hafl and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and loft no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on this way home, in Rome, his first jnquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthuens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruled, and she had not been he heard of since the departure of his lordship. Every mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in bringing the speed of these postilioris, as if he were going to saue the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calajs; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he called to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the paft. If she before, by her infantine carcsses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, which was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind, berieath. There was a molancholy eharin about it which did not seem to arise from miffortune, but some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that like the footing, which strays where a butterflyor a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was neverbrightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs. she knew he destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that 0s the voluntary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteon, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, lheresore, resolued that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scerie\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansian of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overprow him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the proteclion of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe c rowd was excessive—a drawing-rooin had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ru, then wos in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seated by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast them, when he received, at a little distance, the same figure which had contacted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from this brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin—cireumstances storled up ln dreadful arroy—lhe dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe just possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had corijured up the magic his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few rights after with his sister to the assembly of anear relations. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devou-\nring the thoughts. Pereeeiving, clt last, that many were leoving, he roused himself, andentering another room, found this sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to himthose features he lost abroad. He sprang forward, soized his sister's arm, and, with hurricd step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of seruants who werewalting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached borne.\nAubrey became almost distraoted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much moro completely was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in valn that she inlreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more much thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled hlm ;—washed thon to allow this monster to roam, bearing a run upon his breath, amidst all he held down, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he wore to break his path, and discuss his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand tofree the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For day, to rerenained in this store; shut up in his room, he saw a rio one, and ate only when his sister cameo, who, with oyes streaming with tears, besought hiin, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer eapable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, crowded from street to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress becomes neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day seven as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at least laid him down to the rost wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wore soon instead of him who fled from a purfuer faster than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence of his friends, with a friend amongsl them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewam, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, this inward fhudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought the proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parties.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injurios and sufferings, he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conslancing care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absarbed by one terrible subject. His influence became at least so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, the incopable of being roused. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only fign of asfection andrecollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her only to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near hell !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he preferred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a slate, whence not even she could raise a hlin. This lasts many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherencos became less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his grandparents eritering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of releasing the intellect, of which they feared being had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be presenting the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. Hewaf apparently again a capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. Ho began to speak with all hiswonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a cell person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; apening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who bad so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantie expression of cauntenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monfter, for be — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his aath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the grandparents and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a returri of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Mifs Aubrey, desired her to leave him. How to sell upon his kriees to them, he employed, he begged them to dclay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endecloured to pacify him, and reclaimed.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill bealth, he recently understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was decmed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly beconcealod from those among whom he had gained this inf ormatian. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by correct attendance, and the pretenee of great affection for the brother arid increase in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recaunt—could speak of himself as of an individual baving no sympathy with arily being on the crowded earth, save with ber to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had hegun to seem to worry of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well howlo use the serpent art, or such wos the will of fate, that he gained The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important basis, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her mother's deranged stote ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the correction.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pcn and paper; it was given him; be wrole a letter to his sister, oonjuring her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of thase now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to horclss any more than the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without just to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than desirable, this notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Audrey grew almost in front. The curiosity of the servants at last overcome their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving a hirn in the cuslody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with the orie bond was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm the force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not the only bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" Sosaying, he pushed the ball towards his parents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken blood-vessels, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage wassalemnized, and a bridge and a hridegram left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the third of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\n ACC .-\nOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, & o.\n\"The world was all besides him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesly vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be hadthere, induce many British vesfels to visit it—both men of war and merchanlmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships baund to Smyrna, its bountief amply repays for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the hay, and whilst the ring were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mourit Ido (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with a bim; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belangs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the winc-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in hif felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our security very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman hadresided. We were kindly received by a clean old man who conducted us over the mansion. It can besisted on four apartments on the ground-sloor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlor, and a bed-roam, with a spacious closet arinexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stainod walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fix ed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furn-\nct picture: In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. This bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed through Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified iri confirming the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspearos, Boileaus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerinan, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebues riovcls; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at ConstontinopIc, much torn Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messioh was literally scribbled all over, and marked with a pile of paper, on which also were remorks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books that evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeriian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whorn the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reasori .\"\nThe appearance of the house actually was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces looking and fourteen hroad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and f retwork cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than blue roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, walls covered by a fine Turkey earpet, berieath, an warning of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-tops are this furnished, as upon them, there poss their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christ\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges arid lines were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden baek was placed, on which we were told, the Iord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always ottendedour church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decoy. A small streain missing from the ruins designed in broken cafcades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an harizon vnshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnul and palm-trees, several single jslands wore distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enemies were fruilless as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Damjnick, his bariker, who had gone to C andia. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can,\" said me ,\"I dare not\". We did not like to visit the Armenian government on over return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the field, and even danced with them at the nuptial seat. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collocted, to have been cl a very occentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper only to diselose. He had the most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSucb was the inforination with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramblerin G reserve could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of dispositian, arid all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arehitect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco ,\"Tbe individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had gone. ver thenheard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of CaleIa on a very page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the lead of returning to Mitylene ori some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in any way to smooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be only gathered from these little anecdotes. All the firier seelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordships pooms, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and cbarity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solilude if an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head, Benevolence hath thrown beer mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love orpleafures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is the glory of his genius. To do a good long secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eourt, Fleet-street.",
    "5": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this table is founded is very general in the East. Making this. Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed just a present form since the division of Latin and Greck ohurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupl if huried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of being young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that uampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the bload of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and specdally died of consumption; whilst these bvman bload-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies\nIn the Londori Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular oase of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred atModreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an oxaminotion of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively andunanimously afsirmed, that about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vamp This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a cold vampire himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, money people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposit was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mjschicf, the inhabilants having cansuated their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in case of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting clt the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the complicated remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which be just reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same mistakes were adapled with the corsef of those pcrsoris who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agentf upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person fucked hy a vampyre becomes a va mpyre himself, and scacks in a high turn.\nChief Cliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infemal visitations solely to those beings who loved most while upon earth—those lo wbom he was bound by ties of kindred and affectlon .— A supposition allowed to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vompyre sent, Trashy corse shall from lts tamb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck lhe blood of all thy raee; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loalbc the banquel which perforce Muft feed thy livid lvjng corse, Thy uictims, ere they yet expire, S But the order that for the crime must fall. The youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the carrot in flamo! Yet thou must end the task arid mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes other ils lifeless blue; Then wilb unhalowod hand shall tear Thc tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in lifea lock when shorn Affectlons of the ndest pledge was worn — But now is gone away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from the temperature more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also iritroducod in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormentinghirn, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have re sulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being promoted through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been cln eyewitness; and Calmct, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of clneodotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffer-\nice for the limits of a riote, necessorily deuoted to explain, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, though the term Vampyre just the one iri most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrau colocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appearedat to various parties of the leaders of the toria nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the film only attracted his attention, that hemight by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasls where thoughtness reigned. Thofe who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence just arose: someatlributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the objoct's face, did not seem to penetrote, and at one glaneeto pierce through to the iriword works of the heclrt; but feel upon the cbcek with cl leaden ray that weighed upan the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be driving it to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence, oapable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deodly hue of his foe, which never gained a warmer tint, eitber from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its farm and outline were beautiful, mariy of the female hunters afternotoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Merc er, wbo had been the mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms slnee her marriage, threw herself in his way But though the common adultress could not influence love. the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the feinale sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent action with which he spoke to the virtuous wife arid innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was cls often arnong those females who form their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of greclt well, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duly merely to take care of his fortune, while they requisbed the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivaled more his imagination than his individual. He had, hencc, that high ramantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruined so many million apprentices. He belicved all to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the rnifery of a cottage merely consisted of the vesting of elothes, which wore as warm, but which were hetter adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and vorrule coloured patcbes. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of people were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, manymotbers surroundd him, slriving which should describe with least truth, their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening counlenones when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false nolions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was a lothe romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow cland wax candles thal flickered, not from the prosence of a gbost, but srom want of snuffing, there was no foundation jri real lise for the ariy of that congeries of plsing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensation in bis gratisied vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crosfed him in his career.\nHe walchod bim; and the very impossibility of forming an idca os the character of a man entirely absorbed in hiinself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, lhcln the tacit assent to lheir existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his jmagination to picture everything that flatters its prapensity to extravagant ideas, hesoon formed this objjct into a He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Stevens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, srom the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was cool to travel. Desirous of gaining some informotion respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to persorm lhe lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to eriable the young to take some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards pulting themselves upon an equality with the agod, and not allowed them to appear as if falen from the skies, whenover seandalous intrigues cl They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from Hiin, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed thecircling waters.\nHitberto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in this liberality ;— the idle, lhe vagabond, and the boggar, received from his hand more thoughtful to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not vpon tbe virtuous, redueed to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upori virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the doorwith hardly suppressed sneers; but when theprofligate oame to ask fometbing, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sinkhim still deeper in his iniquit This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of being vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of this virtuous ingredient. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressive upon his mind: all those upon whom will be stowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon just, so they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lawest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avbrey was surprised at the apparent eagemess with which bis companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there be entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonlst, and then he lost even more than he gone; but it was always with the same unohanging face, with which he generally watched society arourid: it was not, however, so when he In overy t own, he left the formerly affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursiring, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this siend; whilsl many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, which to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of mclny, the last girl he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of commuting the cnriing of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reprefont his to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profi-\nt ;— but he delayed it — for each day to hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly arid only to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his earriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scencs of riature, wcls always the same: his eye spoke less than his llp; and though Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratitude from it than the constant excitement of vainly wisbing to break that mystery, which to his exalted irnagination began to assume the appearance of something fuperncltural.\nThey soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he left bim in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he waf thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which be apened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardianf, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination, there was an evil power reslderit in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character will dreadfully vicjovs, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, render ed his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, thal his contempt for the adultress hod not orjginated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all th ose females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, throwri even the mask\nAubrey determined upon leaving the orie, whose eharaeter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to reft the money. He resolved to inverit some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pursuing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no flight circumstances pass by unnoticed. Hc entored into tbe samc circlo, and soon perceivcd, that bis Lordship was endeavouring to wark upon the inexperierice of the daughler of the lady wbose hause hc firmly frequenled. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obligod to carry on his plans in secret; but Avbreys eye followed him in all his windings, arid soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though troughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly osked bim his intentions with respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being close to meeting her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he inlended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must dooline accompanying bis Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other opartments, arid calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of the call he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. Theassignation was prevented. Lord Rutbven next day merely sent his favor to nolify his complete assent to separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubroy directed his slopes towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of clonent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of cbranicling the deeds of freemen only besore slaves, had hidden theinselves herieath the sheltering soil or mony coloured lichon. Under the sarne roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pairiter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the falthful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyef spoke loo much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who hold no souls. As she danced upori the plaln, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beavties; for who would have exchanged her eye, app-\nApparently the eye of unimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe oflen accompanied Avbrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, erigaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, flaating as it was upon the wlnd, to the eager gazo of him, wbo forgot the Ictters he had just decyphered upon an almoft efsaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylp Ofteri would her tresses folling, clssho flitted around, exhibit in the sun, a roy such delicatcly brilliant and swif-\ntly fading huef, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of this antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very moment he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciation ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stiff balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, which would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the operi pain, would pclint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered uiewing ln her insancy; and then, turning lo subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would Her eamestries and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest euen of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearestties, forced every year,by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensujng months,his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to lclugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; bul Iantho cited him the She detailed him to the traditional appearance of these monslers, and his horror was incrcased, by hearing a pretty aceurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so cantrasted with all the affected virtuesaf the woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; clnd while he ridicvled the idea of a young man of English habits, marryingan uneducated Greek girl, still hc found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forrning a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was cloned; but he always found it impossible to fixhis attention upon these ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantilo being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one who had worn her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncavering some fragmerit which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very time. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; hut when he saw them shudder at his da ring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, which the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that hif words, mooking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of a bis horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupted in his researoh, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horjzon there was one of those specks which, in the warm climates, so rapidly gather into a lremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is olmost unknowri; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and erc he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its ecboing thunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the cariopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took the flight, and he was earried with dreodfulrapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through the fati gue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead loaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, tbe thunders, for cl moment silent, allowed hlm to hearthe dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Agairi bafflod!\" to which a lovd laugh succeeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed svperhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, ho struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—hisenemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling The storm was still now; and Aubrey, the incculable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Avbrey tbey seclrched for hcr who had ottracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductrefs brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour vpon her oheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seomed almost cls attaching as the life lhat 0 cls attached to the life lhat 0 neod, and vpon her throat were the mclrks of teeth having opened the vein :— to lhis the men pointed, crying, silently struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quicklyformed, and Aubrey was said by the side of ber who had lately been tahim the object of a somany bright and fairy vision, now fallen with the flawer of life that had died within her. Heknew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reslectiori, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They weresoon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — Todescribe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the clause of their blood death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died brokenheartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often devilious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he feemed to beg of his former coinpanion to spare the being being loved. Al other times, he would inprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him called her destroyer. Lord Ruthucn, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avbrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was borrified clnd stortlod at the sight of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by these kind words, implying almostrepentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and carc which hc showed, soon reconciled him to hls preseriee. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic bcing who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually returned into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perc-\neived no difference from the former man, except that at timos he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a silence of rnalicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid rocovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orhs, circling, like our world, the moueless sun ;— indeed, appeared to wisbto avoid the eye of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished hlm now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitudc, hls mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it iri the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would fhow, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a more smile upon her lips. He determined to fly sories, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender core he had taken of help during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hadteried from placeto place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which imagined only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serveas guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a riarrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the riarrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their beads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves bohirid rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Rvthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a motherit behind the sheltering turn of tbe defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bode thcm advance, and beirig exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and lako them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward iri search for the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rulhven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the contest or his own peril, was so surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him —bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promise of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and hauing agreed upon a ransom, he was more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he held an order. Lord Ruthveris strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advoncing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as urieoriscious of pain as he had been of the obje cts about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his a ssistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may saue me—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need to be the death of my existence as little as that of the possing day; but you only solve my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It should not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying inan, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Sweeclr by clll your soul treasures, by all your riature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyef seemed to be brsting from their sockets :\" I swear !\" Brad Aubrey; he sunk loughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his ocquaintance with this man rofe upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if a shivering was something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the eorpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that lt was no loriger there, having been canveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrecy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no place of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed over the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his rnirid was bled ln corijectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he recovered to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with a bim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing seven-\nreal weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. Whilst tuming them over, and examine their curious sarms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented iri the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hasteriing to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrncl, and on his way home, in Rome, if first inquiries were concerning the lady, he had contacted the artist from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruinod, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeoted horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destrayer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the positions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Ho orrived al Cllais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wall, soon wafted hlm to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri that embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infarilne caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she will still be more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had a riot that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the bottom atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind below. There was an inelancholy charin about it which did riot seem to arise from a mlssortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her ftep was not that light fooling, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it waf sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brought by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and wovld in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seems as if those eyes ,— that face were then playing in the light of their own native speaker. She was yel only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, while having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the cont-\nUntil, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansian of blue fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which averpowered him. He could not feel interested in the difficulties of fashianable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the event he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the proteclion of his sisler. They soon arrived in Taiwan, and prepared for lunch the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-raom had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royclly, haste need thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he waf standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engoged in the remembrancethal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himsels suddenly scized by the arm, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast horn, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his riotice on this spotupon his first entry into society. He gazed till his times almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obligod to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he hrow himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Revited again before him—circumstances ftorted up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oatb .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upori. It was impossible that it could be real—he deterinined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to close concorning Lord Rutbven, the name hung upon bis lips, and he could nat succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, al last, that money were leaving, he roused himsels, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in carnest coriversatiori; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned around, and revealed to bim lhose features he most heard. He sprang forwardlessed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he fourid himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he ogain heard that voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, bvt, h vrrying his sister, soon reochedhorne.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subiect, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living againpressed upon half thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, afraid it was in vain that she intreated him to ex-ploin to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and thus terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hisoath startled bim ;— Was he then to allow this morister to roar, bea ring ruin upon his breath, amidst all beld, amidst, and not avert its progress? His very sick might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his goal, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe the bill? He thought of rejoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, bad behavior had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, bought him, for her sake, to support nature. At least, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. Hjf dress became neglecled, arid who wondered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. Hif sister, anxious for bis society, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuerswifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly charged. Stru ok with tho jdea that he left by his ahsence the wholo of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfcious, he determined to enter again inlo society, and watch him closely, anxious to sorewarn, in spite of his oath, all whorn Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister wcls at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, sor her sakc, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavojing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, foaring that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposod upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiroufof saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those inarks of what they considered folly, theyengaged a physician to reside in the house, arid take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His influence became at least so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, the importance of being roufed. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affoctlon and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch a bim—if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! true !\"and again he sank into a state, which not even could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, bowever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frevenl, and his mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day hc would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed. When, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstances of Auhreys being in such an awful situation, where his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubreys alteration was attractive; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a yaung Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astanished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely sinile; for which pressed her breast, arid kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more able to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wontod warmth, and that oongratulato cheer upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who held so long insluened his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysan of rage, arid trampled the interior foot. Upon hearing asking him why he thus destroyed the resemhlance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand ber—then seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance — it seemed af if that voice clgairi bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord R u Iri, the meantime, the guardians and physiclan, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a result of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, be hegged of them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to cherish him, and retired.\nLord Rutbuen had ealled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of just; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened that the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenoe of great affection for the brother arid interest in his fate, which gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers arid tolls to account — could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whoin he addressed himself ;— could tell how, sinco he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to hor soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brain falling at Iength to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continuation.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, built in the valley. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her jri their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denaunced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver jt; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any other kind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravirigs of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of a busy preparation. Morning come, and the sound of carriages broke upon his cell. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him to the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was near really assembled. Lord Ruthvon was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking a bis arm by force, hurried bim from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, arid kriow, if not my bride to the day, your sister if dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his opponents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Auhrey couldn't longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood vessels, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was a riot present when heentered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom loft London.\nEvery weakness increased; effu-\nThe sion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight board had struck, be related completely what the reader had caused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtoned to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Avery sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LDRD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian ArchipcIago, onboard one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Brilish couples to visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and though it lies rather out of the trapck for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargairiing for battle with the natives, the clergyman and rnyself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so riamed) we met with and changed a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who lofted the island four days previous to our arrival in his festival. ct :\"Heengaged me as a pilot\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cotta ge over the hill, fclcing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of just: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines sor it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excjted our curiosity very much, and we loft no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who corrected us over this marriage. It consisted of sour apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtlo iri, the centre, and a sm all fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed iri, the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-class: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large scaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complcte; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebves novels; Schiller's play of the Robberf; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pclrma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Canstantinople, much tor Most of these books were filled with margi final notes, written with a pencil, iri, Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe old man said :\"Tbe lord bad been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a ser vice; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an clged Armeniari who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extremely pleasing. Tbe portico ln front was fifty pieces long arid fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornlces ,( as it is now customary in Greeian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpet, benoath clean awning of strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small slreamlet glided away, grapes, orclnges clnd limes were clustcring together with its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his euenings and nights till lwelve oclock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"prclying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat will what may be termed \"a birdeye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calca, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the rain descends in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminales the view in front; and a little on the left, through the avista of losty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had residod in this romantic solitude: none knew his name hut Domjnick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend ?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said be ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenlan, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was left upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton on silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishorman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to the poor children. In short, be applauded to us, from all we collected, to have a very excellent and beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought a proper note to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself to use it.\nSuch was the information which we departed from the peaceful side of Mitylone; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiargcnius. Arrived at Palermo, all over doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited Hiin at MityIene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some yeclrs from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our bonds, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our refearches at the cottage, but we consolcd ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will receive a return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, arid in justice to his leadership's good name, which has been grossly slondered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his home. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide call his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is in addition to a real reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolenee hatb thrown her mantle. No rnari can read the above precedingpleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he wbo dares justify himself before that awful tribuncll where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest lestimany of a virtuous heart and self-covering conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "6": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this talk is just founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, thala Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the deod rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the Wesl it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where the belicf existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed cl eertain portion of the blood of their victims, wbo bocame emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a stale af replelion, as to cause\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, os course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, iri Hungary. Il appears, thol upon an examination of the commander-in-ohief and magistratef of the place, lhey positively and unariimously afsirmed, that, about five years before, acertain H eyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been tormerited by cl vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by eclting some of the oarth out of the vampyres grave, and  This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischjef, be inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from correction, and emitting at the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he was bad alive. This done, they caught a hold of head, burned his body, and threw the face into his grave. The same measures were divided with the scores of those people who had prcuiously died from vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their turn ,6 come clients upon others who survived them.\nThis universal belief is that a person sucked by a hammer becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tum.\nThe chief bailiff.\nThismonstrous rodomontade is more related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present ob servations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinovscrime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but complex to canfine his infcrnal visilcltions solcly to those beings be loved most while upon eorth—those to whoin he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition clluded lo in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall froin its tomb be rent; Theri ghastly haunt the native place, And suck tho blood of all thy circle; There from tby daugbter, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loathe the ban quct which perforce Must feed thy liuing corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their si But one that for the lhy crime must fall, the youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must on the lask arid mark Her cheek's last tingchcr eye lasl spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes other ils lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shalltcar The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, ln life a lock wheri shom Affeetians fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine ago ny! Yet with their own best blood shall dr ip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard ljp; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Govls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre rnore accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also introduced in his wild but beclutiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the uampyre corse of the Arabian maid 0 neiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave sor the purpose of tormenting hlm she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she bcing pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives a long accourit in his travel of several astonishing cycles of vampyrism, to which he pretcrids to have been an eycwitnefs; and Calmet, iri his great work upon this subjoct, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrative of illustrative of illustrative of illustrative of illustrative of illustrative of\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be included by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: Vrouoolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THEVAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations ottendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemon, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth aro and him, as if he could not participate therein. Appareritly, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it arose: some attributed it to tbedead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penotrate, and at one glance to pieree through to the inward workings of the heort; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been occustomed to violent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of this face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or fram the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention.\nons, and gain, at loast, some marks of what they mightterm afsection: Lady Mercer, who had been mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sinco her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did clll but pull on the dress of a mountebarik, to attract bis notlce :— though in uain :— when fho stood before him, though his cyes were clpparently fixed upon her, still it seemed as But though the common adultrefs could not influenoe even the guidance of his eyes, it would not be apparent to him: yet sucb was an apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wlfe and innocent daughler, that few knew he ever addressed himself to semales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcained the dread of hif singular character, or that they were moved by his opponent hatred of vice, he was also often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vicef.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an elephant left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet inchildhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they reliriquished the more important charge of bjs mind to take care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, henee, that high ramantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins saw many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vestiring of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter'seye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of the poet were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay eircces, many others surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their longuishing or romping favouritos: the daughters at the fame time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyos, when he opened his lips, soon led hirn into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except iri the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snefling, there was no fouridation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation ln bis gratified vanity, he was about to relinquifh his dreams, when the extraordinary thing we have above described, crassed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and very impressive.\nability to form an idea of the character.\nter of a man entirely abforbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, irnplied to the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flclttercd its propensity to extravagant ideas, he formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the effect of hif fancy, rather than the person before bim. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were ombarrasscd, and foon found, from the notes of preparation in — Streot, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wbo, till now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to hjs gvardians, tbal it was time for bim to perform the lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the yourig to take sorne rapid ftepf in the career of vice towclrds puttirig lhemselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fo They consented: and Aubrey immediately menlioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherlo, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results ofscred different conclusions from the apparent motives to help conduct. His cornpanion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate waist. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that hc hestowed his arms ;—these were senl from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profigate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuouf legend. There was one circumstanee about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably forced that there was a curse upon il, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At BrusseIs and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion saught for the oentres of all fashionable vice; there be entered into all the saught for the oentres of the faro table: he betted, and always gambod with success, except where he known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the sane urichanging face, with which he generally watched In every town, he left tho formerly affluent youth, torn from the circlo he adorned, cursing, in the source of a dungeon, fate that had drawn him within the roach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry childrenreri, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fatisfy their prefent carving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, then Iast gilder he had just sncltched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be tho result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experience. Aubrey often wished to represent him to his friend, clandbeg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he dela yod it — for each day hehoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthveri in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrcy was near the object of bis curiosity, hc obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to bif exalled imagination began to save the appearance of something fupernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the marning circle of an Italian country, while he went in the fear of the memorials of another alrnoft deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the sirst waf from his sisler, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it bad before entering into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his composition, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians instead upon bis immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of jrrefistible powers of seductlon, rendered bis licentjous habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that bis conternpt for the adultrosshad not originated in hatred of her character; but that he was required to enhance his gr atlfication, lhat hif victim, the partner of his girl, shovld be hurled from the pinnaole of unsulliod virtue, down to the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femalos wham he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue,\nAubrey delermined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in this mean while, watching him more closely, afraid to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon peroeived, that his Lordship was ericipuring to work upon the inexperlence of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimarried female is met with in society; hc was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Avbreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that on the assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losingno time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rulhven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, forming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to lend her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notjfy his completeo assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleeps towards Greece, and crossing Penlnsula, soon found himself at Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronical lhe deeds of freemen only before slaves, held hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or mony colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourlray ori canvassthe promised hope of being faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that beer eyes spoke too much inind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dancod upon the plairi, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thaught the gazelled a poor type of her b eauties; for who would have exohanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to be the taste of an epicure. The light ftep of Ianthe oflen accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, shaw the whole beauty of beer form, floating as it was upon the wind, to be eager gazc of him, who forgot the letters he had iuft decyphered upori an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplatlon of her sylph-like figure. Often would be trosses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray sueb delicately brilliant and fwiftly fading huesil rnight well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and still balls. Whilst he drew that remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon lhe open pain, would point, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, thc marriage pomp sheremembered viewing jri her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all Her eo rnestnesf and apparent belies of what sbe narrated,exciled the interest even os Aubrey; and often as she told hirn lhe tale of the living vampyre, who bad passed yoars amidft hjs friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a louely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by bearing a protty accvrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still porsisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the formal power of Lord Revite.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so controstcd with all the affected victims of lhe women among whom he had sought for hjs vision of romarice, won hls heort; and whilo he ridiculed lheidea of a young mcln of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found itirnpossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around the bim, whilst iri his mind, he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possession of his thoughts. Theanthe was unconsciaus of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whose ber guardian was oc cupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She badly appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, o, pale with horror at the very anime. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detair him for sew hours when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him nol to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would never remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and denou nced the most heavy evils of pending him who dared ta oross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his darling thus to mock a superior, external power, the very name of which apparently made their blood free, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatterided; bewas surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of thofo horrible friends, hod inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to rolum, orc night allowed the power of these beings to be pulled in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so oocupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light wouldsoon erid, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climatos, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their ragc upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climatcs, is almost unknown; mediately the sun sets, night begins: arid ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had soarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forcod itf way through the canapying foliage, wbilst the blue forked light seemed to fall and radiate at his very feel. Suddenly, a bis horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the enlanged forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightriing, that he wasin the neighbourhood of a novel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the store. As he approached, the thunderf, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrioks of a woman mingling with the ftifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uribroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled out his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in the vampire darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; sor, though he called, still tbo sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He faund hiinself in contact with some one, whorn he immediately selzed; when o voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt hiinself grappled with one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to help life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he waslifted from his feet and hurried withenormous foree against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes ofsoot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnore burst upon him, to perceive the army from his fair conductress brought in a lifeless cross. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was built a vision clrising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, slretched by the bis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed cllmost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon herneck and breast waf blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultarieously slruck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had already been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, orid take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of cl par ticular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of a church whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, or they approach the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catostrophe. — To doscribe their grief would be impossible; but when they afcerlated the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heeled.\nAubrey being put to hed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthvon and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combinationatiori he seemed to beg of his sormer companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecote maledictions upon his head, and reassure him called her delroyer. Lord R enchanched at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrlfied and struck the sight of him whose image he bad now combined with the lhat of a Vainpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still made by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconclled him to his presence. His lordship secmed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convadescence began to be ropid, ho again gradually relired into the same state of mind, andAubrey perceivod no difference from the former man, excepl that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze flxed intently upon him, withcl smile of malicious exultaljon playing upon his lips: he knew nol why During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wavef raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri ;— indeed, he appcared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that eIasticity of spirit which had once so dislinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much cl lover of soltude and silence as Lord Rvthvcn; but much as he wifhed for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atheris; if he sought it ln the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lhen suddenly turning rovnd, would sbow, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile vpon hcr lips He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitterassociations in this mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken half a bill during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight tbesc reportf, which they imagined werc only the invention of individuals, whose intcrest it was to excltetbe the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled within a few hours, more to serve as guides than a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large massos of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they bad reason to repent their negligenee; for scarcelywero, the wbole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, irnitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: butashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with lnsulting shovts badc them advan ce, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthveri being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon introduced them to convey his wounded sriend to a neighbouring cabiri; clnd having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more dlstvrbed by their preserved by their preserved, merely to guard the entrance till their command should return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveris strength rapidly decreased; in two days the information ensued, and death seemed advanced with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of that last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may saveme—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you must save my honour, your friends hanour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explode tho whole — but if you would conccal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world mouth — and if my death was unknown far some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swecler !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exulton violence ,\"Swear by all your foul reveres, by all your nature fears, sweor that, for a year and cold day, you will not i major in your knowledge of my crimes or death toany living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— His eyef seemed burst from their stomachs :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his account.\nan acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivoring came over him, cls left from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been conveyed by bimself arid comrados, upan his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighboring mount, according to a promife they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astoriished, and taking several of the meri, determined to go and bury just upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no traco of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers sworc they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to beighten that superstitious molancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those offects he had with him helonging to Lord Heaven. Amongst other things, there will be a casecontaining feveral weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Wh, ilt turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dag ger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he fourid the weapori, and his horror mcly be lmagined when he discovered that jt fitted, though peculiarly fhaped, the sheath he held iri his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainly — theyseemod gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particulor form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alikc in splendour on both, and left no room far doubt; there were also drops of b blood on each.\nHo left Smyrna, and on this way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens detective arts. Her parents were in distress, their fartunc ruined, and she had not been heard of finance the departure of this lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destrayer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and the hlsonly occupation cansisted on bringing the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his well, soan wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of half fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more att-\naching as a company.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which goes to gaze and a place of the drawing-room assemblies. There was norie of that light brilliantly which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the light of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did it seem to arise from misfortune, but from the sorne feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butlerfly or a colover may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her space was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his afsection, arid would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians morefit that her presentcltiori should be delclyed until her brother returned from the conflict, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-roam, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansiori of his falhers, and sed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had wilnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to book in the smile of royalty, hastened the thilher. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was st anding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engoged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—hefelt himself suddenly seized by the arrn, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a picture that would blastbim, when he perceived, at a little dislance, the same figure which had contacted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gave him till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into hiscarriage, and was driving home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his harids upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogoin before him—circuinstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—bis oath .— He roufed himself, who could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had injured up the image his mind was refting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for thought he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upori his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nigbls after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a rnatron, he retired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused hirnscls, and entering another room, found his slster surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversaliori; he ottempled to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced her towclrdf the street: at the door he sound himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lordf; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whifper close to him —\"Remcmber your oath !\"— He did not dare loturn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached hame.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subie, somehow much more completely was it engrossed, now that the eertainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisters attenlions were now unhecded, and it was in vain that sheintreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a cold few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him ;—was he there to follow this monster to dream, boaring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by the film. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a death; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wondered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; first he returned with the evening to the house; but at least he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, conscious of his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that hc left by his clenee the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were uriconscious, he decided to enler again into society, and watch him clofely, anxiouf lo forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approachod with jntimacy. But when he entered a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at the end obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings, he bad daily encountered inhis wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they changed a physician to reside in the house, and take a constant core of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely will his mind be absorbed by one terrible subject. His inooherence became at last so great, then he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attacked a glassylustre ;— the only sign of afsection and recollections remaining displayed itself upon the eritry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch help — if your love for me isaught, do not go near home !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he sarik into a state, whence not even she could rouse them. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his iricaherences became less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a portion of just gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upontbe last day of the year, one of his guardians eriteriring his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melaneholy circumstonce of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going to the next day to be married. In tantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glod of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the color of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so diligently far rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at behind the features of the monstro who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portroit in a paroxysm of ragc, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he has destroyed the rosemblancc of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frontic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance — just seemed as if that voice again bade him reinernber his oalh—he turned sudderily round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him bull saw In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the wholo, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and foroing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he ignored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined to take possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily uriderslaod himself to be the cause of it; but where he leamed that he was deemed insanc, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. What could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils also recount—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whoin he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, he had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if just were merely that he might listen to her soothing content ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent art, or such was the will of fate, that gained her affections. The little of the elder branch falling atlength to hirn, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening to marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged stale ,) which was to lake place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the horror of those now in the grave, who once held her iri their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a sew hours that marriago, on which was denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, be thought it better not to harass any more the mind of MissAuhrey by, what he considered, the rovings of a maniac. Night passed on without rost to the busy inmates of the house; and the Abbey board, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound ofcarrage broke upon this ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The victory of the servants clt last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the study of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a memory found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Steven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear — Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had brokering blood-vessels, and he was conveyed to the body. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not the present who he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusiori of blood produced symptoms of the near opproach of death. He desired his first guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\nct :\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of interest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian ArchipeIago, on board one of bis Mojesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, iri, the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—bothmen of war on merchantmen; and though illics rath er out of the trock for sbips bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyago. We londed; as usual, at the bottom of the baby, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself look a ramhle to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Grcek as our guide. Wbo told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. ct :\"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" Arid would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylenc, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, helorings lo hiin, and he has left an old man in charge of lt: he gave Dominick, the wine-tr ader, six hundred echlnes for it ,( about L 250 Eriglishcurroncy ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his selucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excjted over curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had refused the idea. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of sour apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a cl drawing-rooin, a sittingling parlour, and a bed-room, with a cool spacious closet and annexed. They work all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on eitber s side, a lar ge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning paslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furnilurc. In the hall stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no interiors, no single painting. The bedchamber had nearly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old mcln told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large scandals chesl in the closet: it was operi, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recesf lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, Iri German Ianguoge; Klopstook Mefsiah; Kolzebues riovels; Scbiller's play of the Robberf; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old mari said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sajled, and forgot to place them with them others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the Iord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of this house constantly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black paints and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fire Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the housotops are thus furnisbed, as upon them, the Greeks harvest their everything in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating fruit, anderijoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streomlet glided away, grapes, orclnges and ljmos wero clcring together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bvshes, cl marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\"arid always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eyeview\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam leaking from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woodsnear the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadawed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little from the left, through a vault of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wove with spols of emerald greeri. I seldoin enjoyed a quiet inore than I did this; but our enquiries were frultless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his bankcard, who had bad gone to Canada. \"Tbe Armcnian,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I mean,\" said be ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the American, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated love world. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, who writes to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wcaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had loft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to their poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and which could buy her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deparled from the peaceful islo of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambleln Greece would be. He had money, it was evident: he held a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark a peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco ,\"Thc individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on theislarid of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calca on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believe it is no quile uninteresting, and iri justice to his lordships, good narno, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as urifeeling disposing, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth lost sorrow, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as maybe, apparently gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depictod in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosorn. Tenderness, fympclthy, and ehclrity appoar to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason far rnarking thing as a beginning on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevalericehath thrown hermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryrnan. Will respect his loues or pleasures, I do riots save a right to give an opinion. Reports are over to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that the awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do a good ln secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and feeling conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crowdlock, Fleet-street.",
    "7": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidorl.\nTHE observation upon which this tole is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabiaris it appears to be cammon: it did riot, howcver, extend itself to tbe Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed itf present form finance the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, lhat a Latin body could not corrupt ifburied in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondersul stories, still extant, of the dead ris ing from their graves, and secding upon the blood of In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyros nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who beeame emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily dled os consumptions; which the human blood-suekers fattened—and their veins become distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which if stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appeclrs, that upon an examination of the commander-in-cbief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, who had been torinented by a vampyre, but had sound a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyros grave, and rubbing This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tarmented by him, and the cl deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attocks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praof having been thus obtained, they resarted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those persoris who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his lvm.\nThe brief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as cl sort of punishment after death, for some heinous erime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compolled to confine his infernol visitatioris salely to those belngs heloved most white upan earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindrcd and affection .—Asuppositiori allvded to in the \"Giaover\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy curse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghasty haunt the native placo, And suek the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which porforce Must seed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demori for their sire; As cruising there, thou cursing them, the flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the lhy crime must fall, the youngest, best beloved of the oll, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the hell in flamc! Yet thau must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—bcr eye's lclst spark, Aridthe last glassy glance must view which freezes its lifolesf blue; Theri with unhalowed hand shall tear The tresses of her ycllow hajr. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondost pledge was worn—But now is borne away by lhoe Memorial of the agoriy! Yet with their own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, G 0— and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire corso of the Arabian movie Oneiza, who is represented after having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best lovedwbilst in existence once. But this cannot be supposed to have refulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraoious Tovrnefart gives a long account in his travels of several oslonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of aneodotes, and traditional narratives illvstrative of its effects, has put farth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting nolices on this singularly horrible supcrstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of o note, nccessorily devotcd lo explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyro is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipatioris attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leader of thetori anobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around the hill, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whonce it arose: sorno altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the iriward working of the heart; but sell upon the cheek with a leaden raythal weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence eapable to engage their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, whieh never goined a warmer tint, neither from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its furiters aster notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every morister shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in a hif way, arid did al 1 but put on the dress of a But though the common adultress could no influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be waf as often among those females who form the boast of lhelr sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, he came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: who was an orphan left with an only sisler in the blue possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his sortune, whilc they clinquished the more important charge of bis rind to lhe care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his argument. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a eottage merely corisisted on the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the palnter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in line, that these dreams of poets were the realities of life. He wos handfome, frank, and rieh: for these reasons, upon his cintering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with leclst trust heir languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightcning countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling cyes, where he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitory hours, he started at finding that, excepl iri the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a gbost, hut from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation ln real lifo for any of those congeries of pleasing plctures and descriptions oontained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding how-\nver, somo compensatiari in his gratified vanity, he was able to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of e xtomal objects, than the tacitassent to their existence, impIied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon sormed this object into the heroof a romance, and detormined to observe theoffspring of his fanoy, rather than He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, arid so much advanced upon his riotice, that his pre-senco was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hirted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the taur, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid sleps ln the career of thoinselvos upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalouf intrigues are menlioned of the subjects of pleasantry or of praise They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from a bim proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, wobo, apparently, had nothing in a company with other men, be gladly accepted it, and in the after days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had a rio opportunity to study Lord Ruthveris character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusioris from lhc apparent motives to his product. His composition was profuse inhis liberality ;— the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virluous, redvced to indigence by the rnisfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bostowed his alms ;— there were sent from thedoor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when thc profligale came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper iri bis iniquity,  This was, however, attributed by hiin to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally provails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thore was one orcumstarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon hismind: all those upori whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffald, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. AtBrussels and other tawns through which they passed, Aubrcy was surprised at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought sor the centres of a fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he he hetted, and always gamblcd with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then helost even more than he gclined; but it was alwayf with the same unchangingface, with which\nrkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-deod nose. In every town, he left the forrnerly affluent yauth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sato that had drawnhim withiri the reach of his friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthirig of his late irnense wealth, wherewith to bvy even sfficient to fatis Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the rui ner of mariy, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of this innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which will not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experience. They often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;—bul he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; bawever, this never occurred. Lord Rutbveri in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyes spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratitude from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernalural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst hewas thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatienoe; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was aneuil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that hif choracter was dreodfully vicious, for that the possessioriof irresistible power of seduction, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the par tner of his guilt, should behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hcld, since his departure, thrown evon the mask aside, and had not scr\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. Ho resolved to invent some plastic pretexl for abandoning hjm altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch birn rnore closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the Iady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all bis endings, and soon discovered that an clssignation had been appoinlod, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and clbruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the fame time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being passed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Rutbven next day merely sent bis servant to natify hif complete ossent to separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Peninsua, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himsolf in tracing the faded recards of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only bef or slaves, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured clothing. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, of beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes for too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dariced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelled a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of ariimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the last of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kclshrnore butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her sorm, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just dccyphoredupon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her lresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray suob delicately brilliant and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse lhe forgets the vcry abiect he bad before the light of vitol importance to the proper iriterprelation of a passage in Pausonias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wish to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would sland by, and wotch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would their describe to him lhe circling dance upon the open plain, would point, to him in all the glowing colors of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tale Her earnestness and apparent bellef of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wbo had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by foeding upon the life of a lavely semale to prolong bls existence for the ensuing months, his bload would run cold, whilst he ottempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but I She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his harror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading beer, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the rnany concidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women omong whom he had saught for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducclted Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost family form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiqvarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but be always found it impossible to fix bis attention upon the ruins around him, whllst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful professor of his thoughts. Daniel was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frarik infantile being he had first known. Shc always feemed to part from him with reluctonce; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she would visit her favourite haunts, whilst her gvardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several p resent, affirming their existence, pale with horror as the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his exeursioris, which was to detain hirn for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him nol to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a woo d, where no Greek would ever remairi, after the day had elosd, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their riocturnal orgies, and denounced the most beavy evils as impending upon the hlin who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his darling thus to mock a superlor, irifernal power, the very name of which apparently inade their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Auhrey sel off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the mysterious face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with suchterror. When he was about to deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night ollowed the power of these things to be put in action ;— he prornised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceivo that day-light would soon end, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gathered into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He at least, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in those southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scaroely ari interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly hishorso took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the enlunciled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the grave of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves andbrushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some rope to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for amoment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he wasstartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was happy.\narently unperccived; for, though he called, still the sourids continued, and no notice was the laken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled with one whose strength seemed superbuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was Iifted srom his feet and hurlod with enorrnovs force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, andkneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat — when the glare of mclny torches penetratling through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed hjm ;—he instantly rose, and, leaving hls prey, rvshed through the door, and in a moment the crash The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They unlered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the defire of Aubrey they searched for her who badly altracted bim by her cries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchef once more burst upon him, to peroeive the airy form of his falr conductress brought ln a lifel ess corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was about a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, where he unclosed thern, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as atlaching as the life that one dwelt thore :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this tbe men pointed, crying, siinultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf said by the side of her who had lately boreged to him the object of so many bright and fairy versions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamenlable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but where they afcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died, broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent feuer, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven arid upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. Al other friends, he would im precale maledictions upon his bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately played himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified andstarled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words,implying a lmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, arixiety, and care which he showed, soon recoriciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; ho no longer appcared that apathetic being who had so astonished Auhroy; but as soon as hif convalescence began to berapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that al times he was surprised to meet bis gaze fixed into ntly upon him, with asmile of malicius exultation playing upon his lips: he knew nat why, but this smile haunl During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was a company engaged in wotching the tideless waves raised by the ooling brecze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eye of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as wished for folitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he shouted it amidst the ruins, he bad from rly frequented, the Clinton form stood by his side—is he sought it? iri the woods, her light step would appear wanderingamidsl the underwood, in the quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throat, with a rneek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every diroclion, and sent every spot to which a recolleetjon could be attached: but though they thus hadtened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the involvement of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabilants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defenoe. Uponentering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were ftortled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. Iri, an instructor, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behindrocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the eir exomple, rctired for a mornent behind the sheltering turn of the defjle: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shauts bade lhcm advance, and being expased to unresistling slclvghter, is any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to revise forward in the Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven recolved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was so surpriscd by seeing the robbers' faces around hlm—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthveris being wounded, immediately thrown up their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey foon induced them to convey a wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an arder. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed to be unconscious of the pain af he had been of the object about him: bul towards the close of the last evening, his inirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honor, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .,\"I ncod bvt little —my Iife ebbs apace — I cannol explain the whole — but jf you would conceal all your kriow of me, rny honour were free from stain in the world moulh — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" criod the dying mon, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not imparl your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever money happens, or whatever you may see. \"— This eyes seemed hursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Avbrey; he frank laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting a bim. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovcl in which he had lost the corpse, when a robbcr mel him, and insormed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by hirnself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a noighbouring mourit, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the mcn, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had attended the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clotbes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, this mind was hewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he bad met with sueh terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had died upon his inind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and a teacher. Whilst tuming them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the samestyle as the dagger discouered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed going to be bound to the dagger; yet still wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haftand sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also dropf of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inqulries were concerning the lady he badly attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthveris scductive arts. Hor parents were in distress, their fartune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's ring became almost broken under so many repeated harrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of ct: Iarthe. He became morose and silent; and the only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, w which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to also, in the embraoes and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching a cos companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue body was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancboly charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not thal light footing, which strayf was a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and perisive. When alone, her face was never braughtered by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians to fit that her presentation should be deloyed until her brother returned from the cantinent, where he might be her protector. It was now, lherefore, resolued that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be lbe epoch of her country into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melaricholy which overpawered the bim. He could not feel interested in the frivalities of fashionable strangers, when his misrid had been sa torn by the evenels he hod witnossed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, arid prepared sor than a hot doy, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drinking room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. ct: Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, hoedless of all around him, engclged in the remem brance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly eourage to tvrn, feclrful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceivod, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this poll upon his first entry into society. He gazed lill his legs almost refusing to bear a lbeir weight, which was obliged to lake the arm of a friend, and forcing apassoge through the crowd, he tbrew himself into his carriage, and was driven hame. He paced the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid, his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances started up in a dreadsul array — the dagger —bis oath .— He roused him-\nself, he could nal believe it p ossible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he realised into a recess, arid, there gave himself up to his own dovauring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he raused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surroved by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass the land get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most admired. Hc sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd as servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"—Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. Hisisters' attentions were a riow unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a cold few words, and those terrified bears. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this morister to raam, bearing a river upon his breath, amidst all he held deor, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by the film. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his roam, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, bought him, for her scale, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. This dress became negative, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer. also he recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever the fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wore soon instead of him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all born Lord Ruthven approachod with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, hls hclggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was also last obliged to beg of him to abstclin srom seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him from strongly. When, bowever, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resumc again that the truth which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the irijuries and sufferings, he had daily covered ln bis wanderings, and os preventing him from exposing to the general eye, those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take oonslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had atlained a glassy lustre ;—lhe onlysing of affcclion arid reoolleclion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do riot touch him — if your love for me is caught, do not go near the bim !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True !\" and again he sank into a fact, whence not even could rouse a bim. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that severol times in the day he would count upon his fin-\ngives a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly olapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians enlering his room, bogari to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstances of Aubrey's being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Avbrey attenlian waf attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they cared he had been depressed, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avbrey seemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her cheek to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more clived to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wanted warmth, and to anger atulate her upon her marriage with a perfon so distinguishod for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the inonster who had so long insluonced his life. He fixed the porlrait in a paroxysm of a circle, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for be — But he could not advarice—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oalh—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and though this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him fromMisf Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he he hegged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they jinagined, had a laken possession of his mind, encouraged to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and should have refused everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys will health, he readily understood himself. to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultalion and pleasure could hardly be controlled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former composition, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his player? His tongue had dangcrs and toils to recount — could speak of himself af of an individual having no sympathy with any hearing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;—cauld tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it weremerely that he might listen to her saotbing accents ;—jn fine, he knew sa well how to use serpents art, orsuch was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The little of the elder branch falling at length tohim, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage e ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the criminal.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the inost heavy curses. The servants promised they would delivor it; but giving it to the physician, be thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passod on without rest to thebusy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily conceived thari described, the notes of busy preparatian. Morriing came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants will last overeame their ignorance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was over of the train, and in a moment, fouridhimself in the apartmerit where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by source, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had a camo in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisler guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he realized somehow what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Avbrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sifter had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelclgo, on board one of the bis Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that naine. The beauty of this place, on the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, inducemany Brilish vessels to visit it—both men of war on merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for shops bound to Smyrna, ils bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the meri were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the ncltives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to chase called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain ).\ncule s0 named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engoged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of il: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for il ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there for about fourteen months, though not constantly; so he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very much, afraid we lost no time in chatting to the house where over the countryman had resided. We werekindly received by an old man, who connected us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-slaincd walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving cl spring fixed on the side of a small bone Venus in a learning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall, slood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior cell single painting. The hodchamber had merely a large mat tress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greeco. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and paper, which were then in a large seaman's closet in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Sbakspearef, B0ileaus, and Rovsseau's work complele; VoIney's Ruiris os Empires; Ziminerman, in the German language; Klopslock's Messiah; Kolzebues novels; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, anItaliari cditlan, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribhled all over, and made a rked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"Tbe lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, arid forgot to place them with the others; bvt ,\" faid he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the procedure of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty-two machines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the word brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally playing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Greclan architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, boneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, asupon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in frozing, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma cbristi\", eating sruit, and enjoying the evening hroeze.\nOn the left band as we enlcred the house, a fmall stroamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle houses, a marble seat with an ornainental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the third passed many of his cvenlri gs and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to bimself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very doubt ,\"arid always ottended our church twice a week, because Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrlle treks in bloom, and on the summit of which the ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A stream stream issuing from the ruins doseended in broken cascades, until it waslost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, arid an borizon unshadowed by a fingle cloud, tormjnates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vifto of lofty chesriut and palin-trees, several small islarids wore distinctly obferved, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Domirilck, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not tried to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the towri we left several parliculars of the isolated lord. He hod portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with that thenuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, harses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by woaving these articles. He also bought a new book for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a plano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramhler in Greece could back. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which mark a peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; hut \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, which recognized the recogriized by Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious iri our researches clt the cottage, but we consulted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeoling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in anyway to sooth lost sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elogantly depicted their lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendorness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the purpose of solitude is an additional reason for rnarking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding playing \"traits\" without feeling the pro sound of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he would dares juftify himself before that awful triburialwhere all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-morlal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secrel, and shun the world appause, is the furest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nct: Gilet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleot-street.",
    "8": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE fuperstition icon which this tale is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, oxtend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has anly assumed its present form since the decision of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin bodycould not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, arid formed the subject of many wondersul stars, still extant, of the dead rjsing from their gravef, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, al ovor Hungary, Poland, Australia, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, thatvampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of lhe bl ood of their victims, who became cmaciated, lost their strength, arid speedily died of oansumptions; whilst these human blood-suckersfclttenod—and their veins became distendd to such a slate of repletion\nIri, the London Journal, of Mclrch ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is related to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrales of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and buricll, many people complained about having been tormented by him, arid a depositjon was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove further inischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cafes of vampyrism) sresb, and entirely free fromcorruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid bload. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was d riven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as carefully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the bases into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survivod them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nThe Chinese bailiff.\nThis monostrous rodomon tade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed to vampyrise, but compelled to confuse his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by tjes of kindred arid affection .— A fupposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yel loathe the hanquet which perforce Must feed thy living corse, Thy viotims, ere they yet expirc, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, lhou cursing them, the flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the crime must fall, the yourigest, the best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name — Thal word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tirige—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand sball tear The tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when shorn Affection's fondest place was worn — But now is horne away by the Memorial of thirtie agony! Yel with thine own best blood shall drip; by gnashing tooth, and chling-\ngard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrlts ravc, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful pain of \"Tbalaba,\" the vampire corse of the Arabian mclid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. she best loved the whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and inriocence. The veracious Taurnesort gives a long account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in hjsgreat work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put farth some learnod dissertations, tending to prove it to be o classical, as well as barbariari error.\nMany cvrious and interesting natices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though this present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necossorily devoted to explanatian, and which may now be coricluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in mosl general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucol0cha, Vardoulacha, G0\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a Loridon winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemon, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attenlion, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whencc it arose: some attribulcd it to the dead grey oye, which, fixing vpon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance lo pierce through the inward workings of the heart; bvl feel upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculia ritles caused him to be invited to every house; cll 1 wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable ofengaging their attention. In spite of the deadly huc of his face, which never gclined a warmer tint, eitber from the blufh of modesty, or from the strong emotion ofpassiori, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntcrs after natoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some rnarks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marriage, lhrew But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of winning torigve; and whether it was that it even overcame the droad of his singular character, or that they were moved by his opparent hatred of the vice, he was as osten among those females who forin the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Avbrey: he was an orphari left with a cln only sister in the possession of greatwealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it would be duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the area of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgmont. He had, herice, a high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He belicved all to sympathise with nature, and thought that vice was lhrowri in by Provvvvvvvvvvvv merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misory of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in the final, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsomo, frank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striulng which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sporkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into falso notions of his talents and his merit. Atlached as he calls to the romance of hif solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, who was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of cl man entirely absorbed iri hiinself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avaidance of lheir contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to exlravaganl ideas, he soon farmod this object into the hero of a romarice, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon a hif notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the riotes of preparation in — Stroet, that he was about to travel. Desjrous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he binted to hisguardians, that it was tiine for him to persorm the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps iri lhe career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear af if fallen from the skies, whenever fcandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasant Theyconsented: and Aubroy immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Robert, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in the after day they had passed the circle walers.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthveris charocter, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different opinions from the apparent molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberity ;— the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from the best hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that just was not upon the virtuous,reduced to iridigence by the misfortunes attendont even upon virlue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but wben tho profligato came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him slill deoper in This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally preuails over the retiring behavior of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and olber towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with whom his oompanion soughl for lhe centr es of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally walched tbe so In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that he had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immonse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the rujner of many, then last gilder he had justsnatched from the convulsive grasp of theinnocent: this might but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of coinbclting thecunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent his friend, and beg him to resign that chority and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed just — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak from only and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven iri his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rleh scenes of nalure, was always the sclme: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and though Avbrey was near the object of his curiosity, be obtained no grealor gratislcation from it than the conftant excitement of vainly wishjng to broak that mystery, which to his exalled jmagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time last sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance, preparing the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he waited in search of the mernorlals of another almost deserted city. What he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he operied with eager impatience; the first waf from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if lt had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, thefo seemed to give a high sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians instead upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadsully vicious, for that the passession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. Il had been discavered, that his contempt for the adultress had riot originated in hatred of her choracter; 6vt that hc hod required, to enhaneo hif gratlfication, that his victirn, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle os unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradotion: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character bad not yel showed a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent somc plausible prelext for abandoning hjm altogether, purposing, in the meon while, to watch him more closely, and to let na slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeovouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; be was therefore obliged to earry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation on had been occupied, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing rio time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a riote, to say, that from that moment, he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven noxt day meroly sent his servant to notify his complete assent to separation; but did not think arily suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soori found himself at Athens. Ho then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soan occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slavef, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same raof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that fhe might have formed the mode 1 sor a painter willing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or lripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelage a poar type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, opparently the eye of animaled nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the tasto of an epicuro. The light slep of Ianthc osten aecompanied Aubrey in his search after ontiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere utterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, wbo forgot the letters he had just decyphercd uponan almost effaced trouble, in the contemplatlon of her sylph-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhihit in the sun ray such delicately brllliant and swiftly fading hues, it might wellexeuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his inirid the very objecthe had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe the symbols which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— I was innocerice, youth, and beauty, vnaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve the cl memorial for his future and ours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of bis pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him to be circling danee upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the following colours of youthful memory, lhe m arriage p0mp sho remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turriing ta subjects that bad  Hcr earnestncss and approach bclief of wbat she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friendf, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolonghis existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of sucb idle and horrihle santas the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the siend appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged thein, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. Sho detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still perfifted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though ot the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had also tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rvthvcn.\nAubrey began to attack himself more and more to hate her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected victims.\nues of the women ainong wbom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an unedvcated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attacked to the almost fairy sorm before him. He would tear himself at times from her, arid, sorming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to six his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst iri his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possession of histhoughls. The Clinton was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer one with whom she could visit her favourite haunls, whllst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had applied to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain hlm for a few hours; when they heard the name of a place, they all at one begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily possess through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who cried to cross their path. Aubrey inade light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, to the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that these words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the fide of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, there night allowed the power of these boings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he could not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warrner climates, so rapidly galher into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devotod country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fets, night begins: and the crew he had advanced far. The power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the eanopying faliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very seat. Suddenly, horfo took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful ropidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the gaze of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hordly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrourided it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusling to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingliring with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in ane almost unbroken sound ;—he would start led: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the drow of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unpreceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself ln conlact with some one, wbom he immediately sejzed; when a voice crled ,\"Aga in baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled with the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the bronches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incopable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torohes fell upori the mud walls, and the thatchlocled on a very individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they seclrched for her who had altract ed him by hor cries; he wcls again left in darkness; bvl whal was his horror, when the light of lhe torohes once more burst upori him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress broughl in a lifeless corso. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagiriation; but he agairi saw the same form, where he unclosedthem, strelched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, riot even upon her lip; yel there was a stillness about ber face that seemed almost as attacking as the lise that once dwelt there :—upori her neck arid breast was blood, and upon hor throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously strvek with borror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A lilter was quickly sormed, the clrid Aubrey was lild by the slde of her wbo had lately been that him be obieet of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what hls thoughts werc—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun roflection, and take r efuge in vacancy—he held alinost unconsciously iri hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hvt. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lainentical cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the pearls of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe thelrgrief would be impossible; but when they ascortained the causo of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsotable; both died broken-bearted.\nAubrey being put to bod was seized with a most vlolont fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthuen and upon Iantbe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthuen, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon the bearing of the state of Aubreymmediately placcd himself in the same house, and became his constant atleridant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now ombbined with that of a Vainpyre; but Lard Rulhueri, by bls kind words, implying almost the experience of the fact that had oaufed their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ohclnged; he no loriger appeared that apathetic bcing who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, be again gradually retired from the same state of mind, and Avbrey perceived no difference from the former mcln, except that at times he was surprised to inecl his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he kriew not why During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of lhose orbs,circling, like our world, the moveless suri ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAuhrey's mind, by this shoe, was much weakened, arid that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of soliludc and silence as Lord Ruthven; butmuch as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in question of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would s how, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such a bilter assaciations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, but they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection couldbo atlached: but though they thus hadtened from place to place, yet they seemed not to hold what they gazed upon. They heard rnuch of rbbers, but they gradually began to sight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretendeddangers. In consequence of thus negating the advice of the inhabltants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a tarrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neigbbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their intelligence; for scaroely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an inslant, their guards had left them, and, placingtbemselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthvon and Aubrey, imitating their example, relired for cl moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but afhamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unrosisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and toke them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the cnomy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assiftance; and, no longer heeding the contcstor his own poril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being waunded, immediately throwri up their arms and furrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Avbrey soan induced them to canvey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; and having cleaned upon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, far which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strerigth rapidly decreased; in two days mortificcllion ensued, arid death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appoaranco had not changed; he seemed as unconsciaus of pain as he had been of the object about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more that that — I mean not only lise, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do ariy thing,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I noed but a little —iny life ebbs apclce — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, myhonour were free from stain iri the world's mouth — and if my death were unknown far some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\" shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying mcln, raising hlmself with exvltant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature feclrs, fwear that, for a year arid a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatover may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed burst from their socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon a hif mind, and knew not why; when he remembered his oalh, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising e arly in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse. When a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer thero, hoviring been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mountain, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had moved to the summit, he found a trace of either the corpse ortho clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they badly laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurried, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country ln which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighteri that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to continue hiin to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects to be had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing feveral weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and exclmining their curious forms, what was his surprisc at sinding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the sarne style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and hls horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, tho sheath hc held his hond. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yel still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on his whole homo, at Rome, but first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attached to snatch from Lord Ruthuens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this Iady hadsallen a victim to the destruction of Ianthe. He became inorose and silent; and his only occupation consifted in urging the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the lives of someone he held a deor. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soori wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, arid there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching a company.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gained thegaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light hrilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye wasnever lit up by the quality of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or oolour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. Wheri alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forgel those griefs which knew deslroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of thouoluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it was having been thought by her guardians more felt that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the content, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of beer entry into the \"busy fence .\" Aub really would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and sed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivalities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protector of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been beld for a long time, and all we were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was flanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded like his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his native to this spot upon his first entry into society. Ho gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He placed the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his bands upon his head, as if he had abrad his thoughts were burstling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances tarted up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .—He rouscd himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his iinaginatiori bad conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it would be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he was altempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the nome hung upori his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister love the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found this sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him that features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifler's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the slreet: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. Is before his mind being absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainly of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she interviewed him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only taught a few words, arid those terrified her. The inore he thought, the inore was bewildered. His oath startled him ;—was he then to allow this morister to roam, hearing ruin upon his b roalh, amidst all he heard dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his path, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of implying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he registered in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his fister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the Monday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down last, wherever fatigueovertook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from though. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his obsence to the whole of his friends, with a friend omongst them, of whose presence they were unoonscious, he determined to enter again, irito society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his ooth, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious lookf were so striking, hls inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her fako, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remoristranee proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alieriated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey parents.\nDesirous of faving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily oncountered in his wandorings, and of preventing birn from exposing the general eye those marks of what they considered only, they engoged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of hlm. Hc hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. Then he would often live for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emacioted, his eyes had attained a glossy mistake ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of hif sister; then he would sometimes start, and, selzing her hands, with looks that severely affected her, he would desire not to touch him. \"Ob, do not touch him — if your love for me is aught, do not go remark him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even if he could forgive him. This lasted many months: gradually. However, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of ils glooin, whlst his guardlansobserved,thal several times iri. the day he would count upon his fingers, a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstances of Aubreys being long so awful a situation, where his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attacked; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to he present at the nuplials, arid desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lavely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with toars, flowing at the thought of her brother being more alive than the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmlh, and to congratulate her hor upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rankand every eopljshrnent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise al beholding the features of the monster who bad solong influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplod it under a fool. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed tbercsemblance of her future husband, he looked as he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, clnd gazing on ber with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monstor, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one In the meantime, the guardiaris and physician, who had hoard the whole, and thought this was but to return to his disorder, entered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he improved the begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavored to pacisy him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he lea-\nrned that he was deemed lnsane, his exultatiori and pressure could hardly be conceoled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hasteried to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for his brother and interest in hisfate, which gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to rocount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crawded earth, save with her towhom he adds ressed himself;—oould tell how, since he knew her, his existence, hadbeguri to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— in flne, he knew sowell how to vse the ferp The title of the eldor branch falling at length to hjm, he oblained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continued.\nAbbrecy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, eonjuring her, as she valued herown happiness, herown honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their hope arid the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; bul giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whot he considered, be ravings of maniac. Night passedon without real to the busy jnmates of the house; and Aubreyheard, with a horror that much more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a belpless old woman. Hc seized the opportunity, with one band was the soul of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was really assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, found, talking to his arm by force, hurried bim from the room, speechless with rage. Wheri on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered his ear —\" Remember your oath, arid knaw, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Worneri arc frail !\" said saying, he passed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; hisrage riot finding even, had broken blood-vessels, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was salemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nEvery weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He described his sister guardiaris might he called, and when the inidnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEX TRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before the third, where to choose the basic place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the G recian Archipclago, on board one of hisMajesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harhour of Milylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both the ring of war and merchantmen; arid though just lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; af usual, at the bottom 0s the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the ncllives, the cergymclnarid myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, arid other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" the cold would have taken me with him; but I did riol choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man incharge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in a vacancy to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the moon. It consisted of sour apartments on the grourid-foot —ari entrance hall, a drawing-roorn, a sitting parlour, and cl bed-room, with a spocious clofet annexed. They were also sirnply decorated: plairi green-stained walls, marble tables ori either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fouritain beneath, which could be made to play through the branchef by moving a spring fixed on the side of a single hronze Venus in a leaning pocket; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half hals, a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber bad merely a large mattress spread on the full floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble reccss, sorinerly, the old man told us, filled with books and popers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the class: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examing the content. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltclires, Shakspeare's, BoiIeaus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins os Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues nouels; Schjller's plcly os thc Robhers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphletf Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Mefslah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; bvt,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; be isotherways very good. I once did him a service; and I gave the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house actually was pleasing. The partico in front wasfifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrourided by a light structure blacktrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the housotops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wlries, such as \"laohryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet giided away, grapes, oranges and limef were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari arnamental wooderi back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"Isuppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seal was what maybe termed \"a bird-eye view\". A lirie of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrt blue trees in bloom, cland on the summit of which is ancient. The Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended on broken cascades, until just was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon urishadowed by a single cloud, terminologies the view in front; and a little on the left, through cl vista of lofty chesnut and polm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were free uitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will nal ,\"—\"And canriot you tell, old friends.\nnd ?\" said I —\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare riot .\" We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town, we left several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to the former man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live byweaving their articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which your old friend at the cottage ought to be proper not to disclose. He told a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; your imaginationsall on the rac k, guessing who this rambler in Greece would be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, call our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr .FDSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual ,\" said he ,\"about whom you are sa anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels ontho island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the reeluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc ori some future day; but to find that day will never return. I make this statement, believe it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his wordshapps good ncc, which has been grassy slandored. He has been described as a foreign feeling disposltion, averse also associating with human nature, or etributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plclinically gathered from these little anecdotes. All the singer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The Tende-\nrnoss, sympathy, and cbarity appear to guide all bisactions: and his courting the process of solitude is an additional reason for marking bim as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose heod Benevolence haththrown her inant-\nlike .. No man can read the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of being a countryman. Will respect to this love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with coutiori, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsels before that about the national where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-proproving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "9": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is also founded is very general in the West. Amang the Arabians it appears to be comrnon: il did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only clssumed its present form since the division of the Latin arid Greck churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, clnd Lorraine, where the bellef existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their viclims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became disterided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their \nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is o curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an exarnination of the commander-in-chief and magiftratos of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years bef-\nore, a cerlain Heyduke, named Amold Paul, had been hard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the froriticrs of the Turkjsh Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a completely himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and ernitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they reported to the accustomed remedy. A slake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, also which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. They did, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into the bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of thoseperfans who had previously died from vampyrisin, lest they should, in their turn, become angels upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis inonstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to jllustrate the subject of the present observation than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that lhe dececlsed is not only doomed to vampyrise, bvt compelled to confirie hls infernal visitations solely lo those bcings he loved most while upon earth—thofe to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and afsection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Gi\nBut first on the earth, of Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly around the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victimf, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless lhee with a father's name — That word sball wraps the heart in flamo! Yet thov must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw which freezes over its lifeless bluo; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shom Asfection's fondost plcdge was worn — But now is horno away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afritf rave, Tell the se in horror shrink awcly from spectre inore accursed than they.\nMr. Southey is also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire curse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved while in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourlrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a cornplete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of uampyrisin, to which he pretends to have been an cyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustralive oflts effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a c lassical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and intorefting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; thought the present may suffice for the limits of a native, necessary devo-\nted to explain, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general aoeptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipcllions attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the lon a nobleman, more remarkable for his significance, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around the hill, as if he could not participate in the military. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and hrowfear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensatian of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deadgrey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance to pierce through to the inword workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been aecustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotiori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, the mariy of the female hunters after notoriety atlempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affectian: Lady Mercer, who had heen the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-roams sirice her morriage, threw herself in his way, and djd all bvt put on the dress of a mountainebank, to attract his notice :— though in vain :— when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her. Still it seemed as if they were unperceived ;— even her uriappalled impudence was baffled, and But though the comman ad ultress could riol influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to hirn: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few kriew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a writing tongue; and whether it waf that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be was as often among those females who form the boclst of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sell it by their vices.\nAboul the samctimc, th ere came to London a young gentleman of the name ofAvbrey: he was an orphan left with an only sisler in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in childhood. Left also to bimself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquisbed the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenclry subalterns, he cultivated inore his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that video was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the pairiter's eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Hc was handsomo, frank, arid rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers furroved hjm, slriving whichshould describe with least truth through lariguishing or romping favourjtes: the doughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances wheri be approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and bis merit. Attached as he was to the romance of hif solitary hours, he was started at finding that, except in the tallow and wox caridles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of sriuffing, there was a rio foundation in real life for the clny of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in bimself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of oxternal abiects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hif imagination to picture everything that slattered its propensity to exterminate ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and decided to observe the offspring of his fancy He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation it — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, hod only whetted his euriosjty, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for birn to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rclpid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to clppear as if fallen from the skies, whatever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from a proposal to jainhim. Flatterod by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the crushing waters.\nHitherto, Harry had had no opportunity to study in Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his act-\ntheions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was profuse in his lib reality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubreycauld not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the uirtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunos altendarit even upon virtue, that be bestowed hjs alms ;—these were sent from the devility with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him towallow in his lust,or to sink him still dceper in his in This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: call those upon whom it was bestowed, jnevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were also with er Ied to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his campaign soughl for the centres of all fashionable vice; tberc hc entered into a spiril of thc faro tclble: he betted, and then be lost even more than thcln he gained; but it was always with the same uncbanging face, with which his campaign soughl for the centres of all fashionable vice; tberc h In every town, he left the formerly affluent yauth, torn srom the circle he adorned, cursing, in the slitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single fartbing of his lateimmense wealth, whether to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder which had just snatched from the convule grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cvnning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and bcghim to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it —far each day he helped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak French and opo only to hirn; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaled imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in the scarch of the rnemorials of the rather almost deserted city. Whilst he wcls thus engagod, letters arrived from England, which was opened with eager impatierice; the first was from his sister, breathing riothing but asfection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the helief. His guardians insifted upon hls immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrosistible power of soduction, reridered bjs ancient habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in the hatrod of her character; but thathe had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, be partncr of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virus, down to the lowest abyss of infamy cld degrcldation: iri fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, tbrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some possible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, ln mean while, lo watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entored into the same circle, and soon perceived that bis Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequeriled. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarricd female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on bis plans in secret; but Aubreys eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innooent, though thoughtless g irl. Losing rio time, he entered the apartmerit of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, iriforming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have poor such an occasion; and upon being pressed whe-\nThen he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, thal from that moment, he must decline accompanying hls Lordship in the remajnder of their proposed tovr, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all be knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of the Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day mercly sent his servant to riotify his complete assent to a separation; but did not have any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dirocted bis steps towards Greece, and the orossing Peninsula, soon found himself at the Alches. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon ocoupied himself in traeing the faded records of ancient g lory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of sreemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope. of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plclin, or tripped along the mou ntains side, orie would have thought the gclzelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, sar that sleopy luxuriovs look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole heart of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upori an almost offacod that, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofteri would her tresses falling, as she flitled around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might would excuse the forgetfulness of the antlquary, who let escape from his mind the very objecthe had before thought of vital importance to the poor interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but norie con appreciate ?— It was innoccnce, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial sor his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the rnagic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her notive place; she would describe him the circling dance upon the open ploin, would paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the Her earnestries and apparent bolief of what shenarrated, excited lhe interest even of Aubrey; and aften as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friend, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upori the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst being attempled to laugh her ovt of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited him to She detailed him to be troditiorial appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, bowever, slill persisted on persuclding her, thal there could be no truth in ber fears, though at the same time he wondered at themany coincidences which bad all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey hogan to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; hcr innocence, so contrasled with all the affectod virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won her heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englishhabits, in rrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some anliquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the right tful possessor of his thoughts. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was sure the same frarik infantile being he had first rown. She always seemed to part from him withreluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite hauntf, whilst her guardian was occupiodin sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive harid of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several presents, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his expressions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him riot to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever reinain, after that day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resorl of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils of impending him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey inade the light of their representations, and tried to lough them out of the idea; but whenbe saw the shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infemal pawer, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he waf silent.\nNext morning, Auhrey set off upon his excursion uriattended; he wossurprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Iantbe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. Hc was, however, so occupied in his research, that did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the borizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a trernendous mass, and pour al thoir rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted hif horse, dotermined to rnake up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the seven sets, right begins: and ero he bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick beavy rcliri forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took sright, and he was carried with a cheerful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, slopped, and he found, by the glare of lighting, that he waf in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surroved it. Dismoving, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the l own, or let least trust to obtain shelter from the pelting of this storm. If he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed bim to hear the dreadful shrieks of a wornan mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a lavgh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds recuritated, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately said; when a uoice crled ,\"Again baffledged!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by onc whose strength seemed superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from bis feet and kneelirig upon his breast, hadplaced his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating The storm was still now; arid Auhrey, the incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the light of their torches fell upon the mvd walls, and the tbatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flacks of saot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted hiin by her ories; how wos again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more hurst upon them, to perceive the airyform of his four oonductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visitor arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same farm, when he unclosed them, scratched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her focus that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat wore thernclrks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointod, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacaricy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a riaked dagger of a peculiar construction, which he had found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who were bad because engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the family, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were unconsolable; both died, broker-hearted.\nAubrey boing put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon LordRuthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the hearing he loved. At other times, he would imprecate malediclions upon his bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Wheri, the latter recovered from his dclirium, he was horrisied and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the ottention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled bim to his presence. His lordship seeinedquite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetie belrig who was bad so asloriishod Aubrey; but of saon as his convalescence began to he rapidly, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of magicious cultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those words, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; he had formerly frequented, Ianthes form stoad by his side—if hc sought il in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidsl the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; their suddenly turning round, would sbow, to his wild imagination, her palc face and woundod He determined to fly scenes, every structure of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the lender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet served. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot lo which a resolution could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, that they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they irrigated were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it would to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pronounced darigers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a fow guards, more than a scravec cls guides than as a de fence. Upon entering, bowever, a riarrowdefile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligenco; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of rabbits close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, playing themselves hand rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, rctired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, of any of the robbcrs should climb ahoue and take thom in the reor, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost theshelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest of his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Rulhvens being wounded, immediately throwri up their arms and surrendered.\nBy the process of correct rew-\nard, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his worried friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having ogreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being merely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pramised sum, for which he had bad an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, the death seemed advancing with hasty stepf. His conduct and appearance had notchanged; seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his friend became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean riot my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my hariaur, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Avbrey .—\"I need but little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would oonceal all you know of me, my hanour were free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" crjed the dying man, raising himself with exullant violence ,\"Swear hy all your soul reveres, by all your nature feors, sweclr that, for a year on a day you will not inpart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His cyes seemed bursting from their sockels :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rctlred to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstanccs attending his aoquaintance with this man rose upon his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to eriter the hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met birn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by hirnself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a ringing mount, according to a promise they had given his lor dship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon thatrose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, where they had mounted to the summit, he found no place ofeitber the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which allclpparently conspired to heighten that superslitious rnelancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there is a cafe containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. ct: There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious sorms, what was his surprise at finding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastoning to gain further proof, he fourid the weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly sbaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no furthor certainly — they feemed gazlng to be bound to the dclggerlyet still he wished to disbelievc; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sbeatb were alike in splcridour on both, and left no room for doubl; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rained, and he had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey Mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became a morafe and sllent; and his only occupationconsisted iri urging the speed of the postillions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to lose, iri embraces and oaresses of his sister, only memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantjen actress, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never built up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate the soul conscious of a brighter realm. The hair step was not that light footing, which strays where a utterfly or a colour may attract — it was fedate and pensive. When olone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her mother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence striket those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchariged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— that face were their playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was the final approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mission of his fathers, and fed upon each melancholy which averpowered him. He could only feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-up room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawlng-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royclly, haslened thither. ct: Aubrey falls there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that very placc—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in bis ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, searsul of feeling a spectre that would blast him, when he perceivod, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refused to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crawd, he threw himsels into his carriage, and was driving home. He picked the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were broadcast from his brain. Lord. Ruthven again bes ore him—circumstances starled up in dreadful arrcly—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himsels, he could not believe it possible—thc dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—be determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a nuclear relationship. leaving her undor the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features which most ahorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurriod step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found bimself impeded by the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not darc to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost different. If before his mind had been absorbed by the onc subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster living again prossed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was a long voice that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildcred. His oath startledhim ;—was he then to allow this monster to raam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by the thing. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretoh; a bad death, he remembered, had already been knocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in the hifroom, be saw a rice one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sclke, to support nature. At least, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, cold often exposed to the noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disappointed with his bim who fled from the pressure swifter than any—frorn thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, os whosc presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to farewam, in spite of his oath, alwhom Lord Ruthven appraached with anxiety. But where he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious look were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strangly. Wheri, however, Romanstrance proved unavailiring, the guardions thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey parenls.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encounter in his wanderlings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those inclrks of what they considered folly, they engoged a physician to reside in the house, and take correctant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at least so correct, that he was confined to this chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and reoollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then who would sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch the bim—if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he answered, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a cold state, w he did not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, this incohorences became less srequent, and his mind threw off a portion of the gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon hisfingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, w hen, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians erilering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melaricholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, where his sister was going the next day to he married. Instantly. Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark ofreturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with a long society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. Hc was apparently again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her hor to his breast, and kissed her cheek,wet with tears, flowing at the lought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with allhis wonted warmth, and to congrotulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished forrank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a looket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who was bad so loving inflvencedhis life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and completed it under a shot. Upon her asking hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed thif monster, for he— But he could not advarice—it seemed as if that voice agclin bade him mernber his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lard R In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a clear return to his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. How fell upon his knees to them, he exploded, he begged them to play, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had takeri possession of his mind, conveyed to pacisy hirn, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had killed the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deerned insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former company, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affectior for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually waned the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His ton guohad dangers and toils to recounl—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, savc with her to whom he addressed himself ;— could tell how, since he knew her, hif existence, had begun to seem worthy of proservation, if just were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knewso well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of fate, that The title of the elder brain falling at length to him, obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for honoring the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged slate ,) which was to take place every day before his departure for the continent.\nAbbrecy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to hide the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honor of those now ln the grave, who once held her in their arms of their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would not be to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmate of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a boreror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman. He seized this opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a cold moment found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hern: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with r age. When on the stoircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is disbonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his opponents, who, raused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no langcr support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as a physicjan, was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion and blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He described his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related coinposedly that the reader had pervsed — he said immediately after.\nThe guardionshastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's fister had glutted the third of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board one of the bif Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mityl-\nThen, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser hargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergymari and myself took a rainble to the cave called Homers School, arid other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we melled with and engaged a young Greek as our guido, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said Groek ,\" and would have taken a lot with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very goodman. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zcchines for lt ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about f ourteen months, although not constantly; for he sails in his felucca uery often to be disferent islands .\"\nThisaccounl exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in the hastening house where our countrymen had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spocious closet, annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain groeri-stained walls, marble tablef on either side, a large myrtlo in the centre, and a small fountain beneatb, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa completedthe furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchlumber had merely a cl large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the elost: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justi-\nfixed in examining the contents. On the tablot of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; V0Iney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messlah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton Paradife Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1880; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Conslantinople, much torn, but no English Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Mes siah was literally scribbed all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had been reading these books the evening before he said, and forgot to place them with the athers; but,\" sald he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for his particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frawn me far a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; arid I have the produce of this form for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I play to an aged Armenian whorcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought home from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house actually was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, the surr ounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strongcoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furriished, as upon them that Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered lhehouse, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, arid undor lhe shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and night till twelvo oclock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man ,\"praying\" for being was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, beside Sundays.\"\nThis view from this seat was what may be termed a \"broadseyc view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in a broken cascadef, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smoath as grass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctively observed, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; bvt over enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The American\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\"—\" And cann't you tell an old friend ?\" said I —\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare riot .\" We did not like to visit the Armeniari, but on our return to the town, we learnt several participants of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave acow to ane mcln, horses to others, and cotton and silk to girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. Iri short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the college thought the proper not to disclose. He had a mosl beautiful daughter, with whom the lord wasoften seeri walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a plano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing what this grammar in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he hold the philanthropy of dispositiori, and all those ecce nucles which mark peculiar g enjus. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never heard of his lordship fame, as we had been the same year from home; but \"Childo Harolde\"heing put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we oonsoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene ori some future day; but to me, that will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite interesting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing ln any way to sooth its so rrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. Al 1 the singer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for making him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her knotle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. R reports are ever to bereceived with caution, particularly when dlrected against moral integrity; arid her who dares justify himself before that awful triburial where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applouse, is the suresltestimity of a virtuous heart and self-covering conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cover, Fleet-street.",
    "10": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John Willjam Plidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is frightened is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be commori: it did not, bowever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the estoblishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed the present form since the division of Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt is buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and sormedthe subjeot af many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dcad rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief cxisled, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of theblood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consuinptions; whilsl these human blood-svckers fattened—and lheir veins became dislended to such a slate of repletion, as to couse the blood to flow from all the passages\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is ourious, and, of course, credible account of a particular caso of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unariimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had heard to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the frontiers of the TurkishServia, he had been tormented by a vampire, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his h This precclution, however, did not prevent bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of bavingbeen lormented by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attocks. To prevent further rnischics, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, arid found it (as is supposed to be useful in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and empitizing at the mouth, nose, and ears, purc and florld blood. Proof having been this obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lost they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and suck in his turn.\nct: Chlef bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is better related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than the only other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered cls o sort of punishmcrit afler death, for some heinous crirne committed whilst in existence, that the doceased js not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled lo consine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earthb—tbose to whom he was bound by ties of kjndred and afseotion .— A supposition\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Tby corso shall from its tomh be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Tbere sromthy daughter, slster, wife, At midnight droin the stream of life; Yet loathe the bariqvet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the domon But one hell far the crime must fall. The youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — Thal the word shall throw the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—ber eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freczes over its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hand fhall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in a lfe a lock whon shorn Affections fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggord lip; Then slalking to thy sullen graue, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till theso in horror fhrink awoy Froin spectre more aceursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in hif wild bul beauliful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from a lho grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved with existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innacence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in hif travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, towhieb he pretends to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratiuesillvstratjue of its effects, has pvt forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errors.\nMany ourious and interesting notes on this si ngularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limits of a note, recessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonyinous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the uarious parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his significance, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in the theatre. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair only attracts bis attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breclsts where troughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awo, could not explain whence it arofe: soine attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flxing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a Ieaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, arid now felt the weight of enriui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of bis face, which never gained a warmer tjnt, eilher from the hlush of modesty, orm and outline were beautiful, many of the female huriters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some morks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the moekery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indiffererit to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtual wife and innocent daughter, that sew knew he had ever addressed himself to scmales. He had, however, the repvtation of a wirining longue; on whether it was that it even overcome the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those semales who form to boast of their sex from their domestic virlues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the sarne time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquisbed the more important charge of his mind to the care of inerccnary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though that vice was thrown in by Providenoe merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thoughl that the misery of a coltage mcrely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as worm, but which would better adapt to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the reo-\nthe lilies of life. He was handsome, frank, and ric h: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, slriving which should desorlbe with least truth, their languishing or romping favurites: the daughters at the same time, by their brighlening countenances whon he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his Iips, soon led him into false notions of his talcrits and his merit. Atlached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles thal flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was a rio foundation in real life forany of that corigeries of pleosing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed this study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe wcltehed him; on the uery impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a mon entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his obfervation of external objects, lhan tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered itf propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romancc, arid delermined to observe the off He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens offairs wereembarrassed, arid soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it will time for him to perform the tour, which for many gerieralions has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the carcerof vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shew They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, bad nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, cried in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitberto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his vlew, the results offered different conclusions from this apparent motive to his conduct. His companion was profvese in his libercllity ;— the idle, the vagabond, and thobeggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not avoid rernarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunef attendclnt euen upon virtue, that he bestowed hjs olrns ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profllgate came to clsk something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow bim to wallow in his lusl, or to This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generolly prevails over the retlring bash fulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still inore impressed upon his mind: all those upon whoin it was hestowed, inevitable found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns thraugb which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at lbe apparent eagerness with which bis companion sought for lbe centres of all fasbionable vice; there he enlered into all the spirit of lhe faro tclble: ho betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than be gclined; bvt it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he In every town, he left the former affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, iri the solitude of a dungeon, the satc that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat srantic, amidft the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruirior of money, thelast gilder he had just snatcbed from the convuirior of the irinoeerit: this might not be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cniring of the inore experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not teridlo his own. pathetic ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this letter occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than hif lip; and though Aubrey was near the thoobject of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly whing to broak that mystery, which lo hjf exalted imagination begari to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian council, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almoft deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from Englarid, which he opened with eager impalience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonifhed him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his composition, these seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. Hls guardians insisted upon him immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, sor that the possossion is irresistible powers of seduo-\ntian, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his coritempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, lhat all those females whom he bad soughl, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plavsible protext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch them more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnotioed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavoring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequently. In Italy, il is a scldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all hif windings, and saon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though a tough girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly closed him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that was aware of being about to moet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avbrey retlred; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must decline accompanying hls Lordsbip in the theremairider of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthvcn next day inerely sent hisservant to notjfy his eoplete assent to separation; but did riot hint any suspicion of his plaris having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soori found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon accupied himself in tracing the fadod record of clricient glory upon mariuments that apparently, asborned of chronicling, deeds of freemen only befare slaves, bad hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, exisled being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind far any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged ber eye, apparently the eye of climated riature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the last of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his search after antiquities, and often would thc uncansoious girl, engaged in the pursvil of a Kashmere hutterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze ofhim, who forgot the letters had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. When the world tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhjbit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and softly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms with all feel, but norie can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawing-rooms and stiffing balls. Whilsl he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a rnemorial for his future hours, she would starid by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him to eircling dance upori the open pain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently inade a greater impression upon her Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narraled, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed yoars amid st his friends, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ongoing months, his blood would rvn cold, whilst bo attempted to laugh her out of such an idle and horrible fanta sies; but Ianthe said to hiin the She detailed him the traditional appearance of these moristers, arid his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still porsisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth inber fears, though at the same time he wondered at these many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthucn.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innoconce, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought far his vision of romance, won his heart; and whilehe ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from here, and, forming a plan for some antiquarlan research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Then he was unconscious of his love, and wasever the same frank infaritile being he held first a friend. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had rio longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in catching or uricovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had applied to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, a pole with horror at the very narne. Soori clfter, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged af him nol to return at night, as he must neessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and deriounced the most heavy euils as impending upon him who dared to cross their palh. Auhrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when we saw them shudder at his daring brush to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melaricholy face of his host, and waf concemed to find that bjs words, mocking the belief of those harrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to deparl, Iantho came to the side of his horse, arid eamestly begged of him to relurn, ore nig that allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. Hewas, however, so occupied iri his research, that he did riot perceive that day-ligible wouldsoon end, and that in the horizon lhere was one of the lhosespecks, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoled country .— He at last, however, moved his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: bvt it was too late. Twilight, in these southern cultures, isalmost unknown; immediately the sun scts, night begins: and there he had advanced for, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders bad scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue froze lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled sarest. The animal at lost, through fatigue, stoppod, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushw-\nThe food which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the meeting of this storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a rnomenl silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman iningling with the stiflod, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokon sound ;—he was startled: hut, roused by the thunder which again rolled over hif bead, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was appareri-\ntly unperceived; for, though he called, still lhe sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he cauld, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifled from hisfeet arid hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his handf upon his throat — when the glare of rnany torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him ;-\nct :— he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke back through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now till; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They ontered the light of their t orches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; be was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of them to reach once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of this fair conductress brought in a lifeless cross. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was a vision raising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her ljp; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the lfe that ance dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of toeth having opened this vein :— to this the men poirited, crying, simultancously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly sormed, and Aubrey was lajd by the side of her who had lctely been to hjm the object of so rnany bright and fajry visloris, now fallen with the flower of life that badly died within ber. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. ct :— To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they afcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubroy being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iantho—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the hearing he loved. At other times, he would interpret moledictions upon his head, and curso him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant. When the latter recovered from hisdelirium, he was horrified arid ftartled at the sight of bim whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthvcn, by his kind words, irnplying almost repentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic bcing who was bad so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalesoence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: be knew not why, but this smile baunted him. During the last stage of this involid recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling br eeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the noveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weak eried, and that elasticity of spirit which had arice, so despite him now seemed to have fled for ever. He works now as much a lover of solit ude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much cls he wished for solitude, his mind would not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins being had formerly frcquented, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would clppear wandering amidst the underwood, in q uest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would sbow, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Heproposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom who held himself bound their career, he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Greece noither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recolleclion could be atlached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of lbus negleoting the advice of the inhabitants, or one occasian they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guidcs than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had reoson to repent their negligence; for scarcely wero the whale of the party engaged in the narrow pa ss, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed reporl of several guns. In an instant, their guards had loft them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilati ng their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: hut ashamed of being thvs detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting saughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they deterrnined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter on the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot on the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hasteried to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around them—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and furrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouringcabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content meroly to guard the entrance till their coinrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the mortification resulted, and death seemed to be advancing withhasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; seemed to be unconscious of pain cls hc had been of the opposite about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was introduced to offering his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may savo me—you may do more than that — I mean not iny life, I heed the death of my existence of a little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" replied Avbrey .—\"I need bvt little —my lfeehbs apaoe — I cannot exploin the wbole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honaur were free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I — but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" oried the dying mari, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Sweeclr by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a yoar and a day you will not lmpart your knowledge of my orimes or death to any living being in a rainy way, whatever may happen, or whatever you inay see. ct :\"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey relirod to rcst, but did not sleep; the many eircmslances clttending bis acqualntanee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to eriter the hovel in which he bad left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no loriger there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, vpon hif reliring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had givenri his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first old ray of the inoon that rose after his death. Aubrey, surrounded, and taking several of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he badly mounted to the summit, he found no trace of eilher the corpsc or the clolhes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For the cold time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the score of the clotbes.\nWeary of a country in which he had mct with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to hear that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to loave it, and soon arrived at Smyr ria. While waiting for a case to conveyhim to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arraringing those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, inferior or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whether turning them outer, clnd oxamining their curious forms, what was his furprise at finding o sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his borror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular forin, the fame vorying tlnts upan the haft and sheath were like in the splendour of the both, and left no room for doubt; there were alfa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were correcting the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents wore in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen to the victim to the deftroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and his only occu pation consisted of long running the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to solve the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a brceze, which served abedient to his will, soon wafled him to the English shares; and he hastened to the marision of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ombraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of this past. If she before, by her infanline caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, which was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and appearance of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light hrilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicale a soul conscious of a brighter room. Her step was not that light foating, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. Wherialone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her family sor that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been pronounced to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be deloyed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might beher protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-roorn, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rathor have remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed down the mearicholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the vents he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all we were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was slanding in a oorner by himself, beedless af all around bim, engaged in the rememhronce that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place —he felt himself svddenly second by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in bis ear —\"Remember your oath .\" Ho hod bardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the sarne figure which had attracted his notice on this spol upori his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, afraid forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burst from his brain. Lord Rutbven again before him —circumstances started vp in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; sor thought he attempted to ask the concerned Lord Rulhven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in going information. He went a few nights after er with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a rescue, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get a reward for her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abborred. He sprang forwclrd, seized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, forced hcr towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that uoicewhifper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.\nAvbrey became almost destroyed. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was influenced, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His classmates attentioris were now unheoded, and it was in vain that she interested him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a cold few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started hirn ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst allhe held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even jf be able to break his goal, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, bcoughl him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness arid solilude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became negleeted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the inidnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever the fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuance faster than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, whose presence lhey were unconsclous, who determined to enter again into society, and walch him closcly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his death, all wob. my Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visible, that hif sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, r, remonstrance proved unavailiring, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that this mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Arthur's parents.\nDesirovs of saving him from the injuries and fuffcrings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of proventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered only, they engaged a physiciari to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind abforbed by one terrible subject. His influence became at last so great, that he was confined to hischamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He could become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affeclion and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me is ought, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, she sank into the alphabet, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind tbrew off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his gvardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and thon smile.\nThe time had really clapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellectual, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was called young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered the riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her love very smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more able to the feelings of asfection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to eongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished sor rank and every accomplishment; where he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a parox .-\nthe system of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —then sejzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that he would never wed this morister, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed cls if that voiee again bade him remember his aath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rutbven was In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he bogged for them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had a brother refused with everyone else. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the couso of it; bvt when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mifs Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had darigers and l oils to recount—could speak af himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on crowded earlh, save withher to whom he addressed himsels ;—could tell how, since he knew ber, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely lhat be might listeri to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of sate The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to lake place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness.\nss, her own honour, and the hanour of those now in the gravo, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which hc denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would be better not to harass any more the mirid of Miss Aubrcy by, what heeonsidered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without restto the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concerned than a decried, the notes of a busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcaine their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving a bim in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, which one bound was over of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Wheri on the strollcaso, Lord Rulhven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonovred. Women are afraid !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his alternatives, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effect of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of doath. He described his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he relaled composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Misf Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, arid Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The cause of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, introduced many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though just Iies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wo landed; as usual, at the bottom of thebay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natlves, the clergyman and mysels took a ra mble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. n the brow of Mount Ida (a smoll monticvle so named) we met with and engaged a young Greekas tour guide, who told us he had become from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said here ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Milylene, where I am likely. to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, arid he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currericy ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by a clean old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlor, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were also simply decorated: plain green-slained walls, mclrble tables on the other side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the brancbes by moving a spring fixod in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large eouch or sofa coinplcted the furnilure. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single clinling. The bedchlumber had merely a large mattress spread on the sloor, with two stufsod cotton quilts and a pillow — the cammon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a rnarblo recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's ohestin closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. n the tob level of the recess lay Voltairos, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau works completely; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmcrman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantin Most of these books were filled with marginal riotes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiab was literally scribbled all over, arid marked with slips of paper, on which alsowere the remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Iord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said ho ,\"there they must lie until his roturri; for he is so particular, that were I to mave ane hiding without orders, he would frown upor me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking caro af il, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord broughl here froin. Adrianople; I don't know what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty pacef long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work comes ,( as it is now customary iri Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath the clean owning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light winos, such as \"lacbryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we eritered the house, a small streamlot glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woman back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve oclack, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for him was very doubt ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mo urit Calcla, covered with olive arid myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple opened iri majestic de cay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sca smootbas glafs, arid an harizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates the view in frorit; and a little on the lest, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, seueral small islonds were diftinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a new moro than I did this; but our enqu-\niries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\"—\"And cannot you tell an old friend ?\" I said ,\"If I can\" said he ,\" I dare not .\" We had no time to visit the Armenion, but on our return to the town we learnt several participants of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horfes to others, and colton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collocated, to have a very ecoentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a picture, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities while rnark peculiar genius. ct: Arrivod at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been trovelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said be ,\"clbout whom you are anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him called Milylene .\" We had never heard of his lordship's flame, as we had been some years from the hoine; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene ori some future day; but to me that day would knock the return. I make this statement, believe it is not quite interesting, and in justioe to this lordships good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associaling with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrow, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdolef. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly decorated in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being a king ori whose hoarl religion has set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inantle. No man can read the perfect pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countrymon. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral iritegrity; and he who dares juslify himself before that awful trial where all must appear, alone may consider the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving confidence.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printcher, Crown-court, Floet-street.",
    "11": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is frightened is very general in the East. Among the Arabians, it appears to be common: it did nat, however, extend itself to the Greeks uritil after the establishment of Christianity; and il has only assumed its present farm since the division of the Latin and Greek ohurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extont, of lho dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight voriat ion, all over Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorroine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightIy imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaclaled, lost their strength, and spcedily died of consumptions; whilst there buman blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became dislended to such astate af repletion, as to cause the\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, an oredible account of a porticular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, tbat upon an exomination of the commander-in-ehief and magistrotes of the place, they positively and unclnimously asfirrned, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been tormentod by a vompyrc, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating soine of the earth over the vampyres grave, and rubing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, could not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; sar, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of having been lormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been depriued of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadogni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the moulh, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. The proof of having been thus obtclined, they resorted to the accustomed dream easily. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as deeply as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same moosures were adopted with the course of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, Iest they should, in their turn, become agent for others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in this turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of these present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Groece il is considered as a sort of punishment after dealing with, for some serious crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his inserncll visitatlons solely to those beings he loved most whilc upon earth—those to whom be bound by ties af kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to iri the \"Giaour\".\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from just tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Thcre srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streclm of life; Yel loatbe the banquet which persorce Must feed thy livid living corse, Tby victiins, ere they yet expire, Shall know the de The flowers are withered on the stem. Butane that for the crime must fall, The youngest, beft beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yel thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye lasl spark, And the last glafsy glance must view Whieh freezes over its lifeless blue; Theri with unhallowed hond shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affections fondest pledgo was worn — But now is borne away by the Momorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashling tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—cland with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in harror shririk away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey bas also I introduced in bis wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arablan maid Oneiza, who is represented as baving returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting bim sho best loved whisk in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a coinplete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long amount in his travolf of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; on Calmet, in his greal work upon this subject, besides a variety of aneodotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, af well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present rnay suffice for the limits of a noto, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the first of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, the appea-\nred of the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sirigularities, then this rank. Ho gazed upon the milk around him, as if he could not participate in the train. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by looking quell it, and throwing foar into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Thoso who felt this sonsation of awe, could not explain whence it clrose: sorne altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to piorce through to the iriward workings of the heart;bul fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighted upori the skin it could not pass. His personalities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to show him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attenlion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint,cithcr from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outllne were beavtiful, many of the female hunters after n otoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Morcer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marrlage, threw herself in his way, and did But although the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, just was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He was bad, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico. He was as often among those females who form the boast of their fex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lo ndon cl young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of the necessary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which dally ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all tosympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Provldenoe merely for the precious effect of tbe soene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottagc merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were betteradapted to the pairiter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the relatives of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least through their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into sales notians of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tollow arid wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life sor any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was able to relinquish his dreamf, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe walched hiin; and the very impossihility of forming on the idea of the character af a man eritirely absorhed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of extornal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture eucry thinking flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determin He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far canceled upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthueris affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiaris that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vicc towards putting themselves upon cln equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whatever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from a hirn, who, apparently, had nothing in co-momen with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different opinions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profusc in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the bar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey cauld not avo id remarking, that lt was nol upon thc virtuous, reduced lo indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beftowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door which hardly suppressed sneers; but when the traffic came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to walk in his luft, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevai ls over the retiring bashfulness of thevirtuusindigent. There was any circumstance about the cbarity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon just, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the loweft and the most abject misery. At Br ussels clnd other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought for lhe centres of all fashjonable vice; lhehe entered into all tho spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watched the sclme unchanging face, with which he generally watched the sclme unchanging face, with In every town, he left the sormerly asfluent yo uth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dvngeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat fraritic, amidst the speaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single sarthing of his late immenfe wealth, wherewith to buy overi sufficient to salisfy their present carving. Yct he took rio money from the garnbling table; but immedlately losl, to theruinor of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the irinocent: this might but be lhc result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent him to his friend, and bog him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his marriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiofity, be obtained no groater gratification from it than the constant exoitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to hif exalted lmaginationbegan to asfume the appearance of something supernotural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, arid Aubrey, so a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the mernorials of another almost deserted city. Whilsl he was thvs engaged, letters arrived from England, which he openedwitb eager impaticnce; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but afsection; lhe others were from his guardians, the latter astished him; if it had before entored irito his imagination that there was an eullpower resident in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vioious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enbancehis gralificatiori, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pirinacle of unsullied uirtve, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom have sougbt, apparently on accourit of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the Korean while watching him more closely, and to let no slightcircumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seems that an unmarried female is mel with in soclety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that clri assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though a thoughtless girl. Leaving no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, forming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his emotions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour. He ordered his servant to check other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lard Ruthuen next day merely sent hif servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys iriterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at the Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek land soon occupied himself in lracing the faded recards of ancientgory upori monuments that apparently, ashamed of cbronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roos as himself, exislcd a beirig, so beauliful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wlshing to povrtray on canvass the promised hope of the failhful in Mclhomets paradjse, saue that hcr eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of hor beavtics; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious loak of the animal suited but to the taste of cln epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accomponied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the wholebeauly of her forin, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who sorgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an almost effaced tablet, in the context of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hves, it might wellexcuso the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the vory object he had before thaught of vital importance to the proper inlerprelalion of a passagein Pausclinas. But why attempt to describecharms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected they eroded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his peneil, in tracing the scenes of her native police; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open pla in, would pclint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in hor infaricy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the lving vampyre, who had passed years amidsl his friends, and dearcst ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, his blod would run cold, whilst he attracted to him the riames of old men, who had clt last detected onc She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horrar was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthvenlhc, however, still persisted on persuading her, lhat there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coiricidonces which had all terided to exci to a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rulhuen.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and inore lo Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all that affected virtues of tho women clmong whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; arid while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneduated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attacked to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at tirnes from hor, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was atlained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentian upon the ruins around him, which in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile when he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite hounts, whilst her guardian was occupied with sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with harror at the very name. Saon after, Aubrey determined toproceed upon one of the bif excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after that day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal organs, and donounced the most heavy events as impending upon him who dorod to cross their path. Aubrey made a light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them sbudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood frecze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatt ended; he was surprised to observe the meancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that these words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe caine to the fide of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beingsto be pvt in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot perceive that dclylighl would end, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, ln the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a trernendous inass, and pavr all lheir rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounled his horse, deterrnined to make up by speed for this delay: but it was Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun scts, night begins: and there he had advariced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilft the blue forked lightning seemed to fall arid radiate al his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took the frigbt, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entarigled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, lhat he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting the approach\nched, going to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the peltirig of the storm. As he approached, the tbunde rs, for a moment silent, allowed him to hoar the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifed, exultant mocky of cl laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: bul, roused by the thunder which agairi rolled over his bead, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: s sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though being called,still the sourids continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, when he immediately seized; when a voice eried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh fucceeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whase strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon hiin, and knceling upon The storm was a riow still; and Aubrey, the uncapable of mouthing, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thalcb loaded every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had altracted bim by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the cliry form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shuts his eyes, hoping that it was but a visitor walking from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, strelched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess about her sace that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throal were the marks of teeth hauing opened this vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, silently struck with borror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampyrc !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the flower of Iifo that had died without her. He knew not what his thoughts were—hif the mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his harid, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewamed the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascerlajned the cause of their child's doath, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsalable; both died brokenheartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed wcls seized with a inost violent fever, and was osten delirious; in the so intervals he would call upon Lord Rulhven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountoble combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his const ant atteridant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he wcls borrowed and starlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a clumber; bvl Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and felt rnore by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; bul as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at timeshe was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon bim, with a smile of malicious exutation playing vpon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in walching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs,circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys inirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastjcily as a spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. Ho was now as much a lover of solitude and silenco as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, bcr light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in queft of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crealed such bitter associotions in his mind. He proposed to Lord Steven, to whom heheld himself baund by the tender care he had taken of them during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus bastened from the place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whofe interest it was to excite the gcnerosily of those whom they defended from pretended darigers. In the consequence of just neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, howover, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was tho bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from thcneighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their regligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pclss, when they were startled by the whistling of bvllets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, collecting themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their exomple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detairied by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the economy. Hordly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rulhuen received a shot in the shoulder, which brought them to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robhers' forces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and furr endered.\nBy promises of the royal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the ontrance lill their comrade should retum with the promised surn, sor which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed aduaricing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mirid became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofteri flew upori Aubrey, wbo was induced to offor his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assless me! you may save me — you inay do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but little —my lifeebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would concentrate all you know of me, my honour was free from stainin the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying mari, raising himself with exultarit violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, sor a year and a day you will riot impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to only living being in one way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— This eyes seemed bursting from their forecasts :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances altering his acquairitance with this man rose upon his mind, and knew not why; when he remembered his oalh, a cold shivering came over the bim, as if from the preseritiment of something horrible awailing him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left thc c orpse, when a robber met hirn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retirement, to the prince of a neighbouring movement, according to the promise they had given his lordshlp, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he was badly mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers wore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but be at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the fake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melaricholy that had seizedupon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wailing for a vessel to correct him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects hehad with bjm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a cold case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to reisure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath completely omamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his band. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the d agger; yet still he wifhed to disbelleve; but the particular form, the saine varyingtints upon the hoft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left the room for doubt; there were also dropf of blood on each.\nHo loft Srnyrna, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to search for Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had called a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his ordinary accupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his falhers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraccs and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of the light brilliancy which only exists in the heated almosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the light of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her sacc was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew deslroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was yet only cighteen, arid should not be presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which wasfast approaching, should be the epoch of the cherry eritry into the \"busy scerie\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the meloncholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in that. but the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind could be so lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the proteclion of his sislor. They soon arrived in Taiwan, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, haslened either. ct: Aubrey wasthere with his sister. Wbile hc was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the romembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place —he felt himself suddenly seated by the arm, arid a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blost him, when being perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his legs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hand upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstanced startod up iri dreadful array —the dagger —bis aath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conveyed up lho imclge his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it would be real-\nl — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his help, and he could not succeed in gaining information. ct: He went a few nights after talking with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. leaving her under the production of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Preceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turried round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister again, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: al the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; clnd while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whifper olosed to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not daro to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost difficult. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His first alteritions were now unheeded, and it was in vajn that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His aath slartled him ;—was he trying to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon hls broath, amidst allhe held a dark, and nol avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his mouth, arid discloses his suspicion, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, bought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became reglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to be midnight damps. He was no longer long he recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whenever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuertle than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by bis abserice the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unoonscious, who determined to enter again into society, and watch himcloscly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oatb, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with iritimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sisler was at last obliged to beg of him to abslairi from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpase, arid, foarring that his mind was hecoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume agoin that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirouf is saving him from the injvries arid susferings he held daily encounter in his wonderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a cell physician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to riotice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became in the last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, the inconvenience of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy luslre ;— the only sign of clffection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the story of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, scizing her hands, with looksthal severely afflicted her, he would desiro her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True!\" and again he sank into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohorences became less frequent, and hif the mind tbrew off a portion of its glooin, wbilst his guardiaris observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then fmile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians eritering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubreys being in so careful a situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonlshed them still made by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to seo his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of a very lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowingat the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and overy accomplishmerit; when he sudderily perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, which was a surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long Influenced his life. He seized the portrait in the apparatus of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upan her asking him wby ho thuf dcstroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as he did not understand her —then seizing her hor hands, arid gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that sbe would never wed this monster, far he — But he could not adance — it serned as if that voice again bade him rernember his o Iri the meantime, the guardiaris and pbysician, who had beard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave her. He fell upon his knowledge to them, he explained, he begged of them that delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, and the endoavouredto pacify him and retired.\nLord Ruthven held the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refufed with everyone else. When hc heard of Aubrey's ill health, be rapidly understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultatiari and pleasure could hardly be criticized from those among whom he had gained this inforination. He basteried to the house of his former companion, and, by the correctant attendarice, and the pretence of great affection for the brother arid inlerost in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to rocount—could speak of himself as of an individuol hclving no sympatby with any being on the crowded earth, sove with her to whoin he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had beguri to seem to worry about preservation, if lt wore merely that he might lifton to ber soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents orl, The little of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as anexcuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's dorariged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and chief guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his fister, corijuring her, as she valued her own hopepiness, her own honor, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held her arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours without marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it, but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Avbrey by, what he considered, the raving of a maniac. Night passod on without rest at the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heord, with a horrar thal may more easily be concelved than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless lady. He seized the opportunity, with one bond was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Rutbven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurrled him from the room, speechless with rage. When the staircase, Lard Rulbven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister just dishonovred. Women are careful !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a bottle, had broken a blood-vossel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of calculating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroorn lest Loridon.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He deslred his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had called the first of VAMPYRE!\nEXT RACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, etc.\n\"The world was all before bim, where to choose his place of rest, and provide a basic guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelagolon board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo onvegctablcs always to be had there, induce many Britishvessels to visit it—both men of war and merchants; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Srnyrna, its bourities amply repay for the devialion of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and mysels took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so narrow) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told vs he should come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in this festival. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottago over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old inan in charge of it: he gave Dominick, lbe wine-trador, six hundred zechines for it, about L 250 English currency ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to be different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house where the countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. ct: It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all fimply decorated: plain green-stairled walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrlle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood balf cl dozen English cane chairs, and an empty blanket: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattross spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common hand throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble rec ess, formerly, the old man told vs, filled with hooks and papers, which were then in a lorgeseaman's chest in the closel: it was open, but we did not think overselves justified in examining the contents. Ori the toblet of the thc recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileaus, and Roussoav works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiclh; Kot2cbues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mi 1tons Paradise Losl, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek Most of these books were filled with original riotes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, ori, which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord bad been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place lhom with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until he returned; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing withaul orders, he would frown me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for trouble taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arinenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marblepillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is a riow customary in Greciari architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey corporation, beneath an awning of a strong coarse Iinen. Most of these house-tops are thus furnished, as preparing them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"Iachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet guided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clvslering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a rnarble seot with an ornamenal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man ,\"p praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, because Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led a blue eye to Mount Calcla, covered with 0live and myrtle trees in 6 bloom, arid on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared od in majestie decoy. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termlnates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light bluewave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless of that person who had resided in this Romanlic solitude: none knew his riame but Dominick, a hif banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I could suro he will not ,\"—\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I —\"If I can\" said ,\" I dare not .\" We should not try to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and every danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boot for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared out, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and bonevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought the proper only to disclose. He had the most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen working on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forle, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful islo of Mitylene; ovrimaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler iri Greeoeco could be. He had money it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark pecu liar goniu s. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been trauelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"Theindividual,\" faid he ,\"about whom you are so conscious, if Lord Byron; I mel him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I could visit him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every place. Decply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believe it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse lo associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from the Iittle anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendemess, syinpathy, and charity appear to gulde all his acljons: arid his courting the repose of solitude ls is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, arid over whose head Bencvolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not afsume a right to give an opinion. Reports are clever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may ensure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest lestimony of a virtual heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-streel.",
    "12": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Talo.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tales found is very general in the East. Mandarin Arabiaris it appears to be eommon: it did not, however, extend itself to tbe Greeks until after the eslablishment of Christiariity; and it has only caused its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful storios, still extant, os lhe deod rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood In the West it spread, with some slight variation, only over Hungary, Poland, Australia, and Larraine, where the belies existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain porlion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whllst these human blood-suckers fattened—arid their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodles, and\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular oase of vampyrifm, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and mclgistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood This precautation, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been lormented by him, arid a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, tho inhabjtants having consulted their Hadclgni, took up the body, and found it (cls is supposed to be usual incases of vampyrjsm) sresh, and entirely free from corruption, and eating at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus oblained, they resorted to accustomed reinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alone. This done, they could offhis head, burned his body, and threw the clothes into his groove. The same measures wore adopted with the corscs of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turri, become agents upon others who survivod thein.\nThe universal belief is that a person suckedhy a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nct: Chief Cliff.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is bere related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observation than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered cls a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition allowed to in the\"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse hall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the notive place, Andsuck the blood of all the thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet locltbe the bclnqvet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet oxpirc, Shall know the demori for their si But one that for the crime must fall.

Yet thou must end the task and mark Her oheek 1 ast tinge—her eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Wbich freczos over lts blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in lifo a lock when shom Affections fondesl pledge was worn—But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine ogony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing toolh, clnd haggard lip; Then stalking to lhy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for lhc purpose of tormenting hlm she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have refulted from the sinfulness of her life, being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale called a complete type of purlty and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account on his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, also which he prec-\nnds to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great wark upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, aswell as barbarian error.\nMany curlous arid interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may susfice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to cooperation, and which may riow be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than this rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted hif attention, that he might be a look like it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessries reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it aroso: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glarice to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gclined a warmer tint, eitber from the blush of modesty, or from the strong omotion of passion, though its form arid ovtline was beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attomptedto win his attentions, and gain, at least, some morks of what they might lerm affection: Lady Morcer, who had been threw hersels in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountaine But though the common adultross could only influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex wasindifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few know he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the repulation of a winning tongue; arid whether it was that it evori overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he wasas often among those females who form the boost of their sox from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphanleft with an only sister in the possession of a great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his forturie, while theyrelinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care ofmercency subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of banour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympath-\nhise with virtue, and thought that uice was thrown in by Providence inerely for the picluresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vestling as elotbes, which were as warm, but which were botter adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular foods and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the relatives of life. He was handsome, srank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightering countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he apened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romance of his social hours, he waf stortled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, nol srom lhe presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation iri real life for clny of that congeries of ple asing pictures and descriptions contained in those volurnes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being which had above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the lacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidarice of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this ob jecl into the hero of a romance, arid determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of the preparatlan in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this familiar character, who, till naw, had only wbetted his eurjosity, he hinted to his guardions, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowed them to appear af jf fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues ore menlioned as the subjeot They oonsented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rvthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mork of osteem fromhjm, wha, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity to sludying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the parent motives to his conduct. His companiori was prosuse in a bis liberally ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate warits. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was riot upon the virluous, reducing to indigence by the misfortunes ottendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alarms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sncers; but when the profligato came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow iri his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicjous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulnefs of the virtuous indi gerit. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those ones whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon il, because they were clll either led to the fcaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most awful misery. ct: At Brussels and other towns tbrough wbi ch they passed, Aubreywas surprized to the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cenlres of all fashjonable vice; there be enlered into the rash youthful nouico, or thc lucklcss falher of a nvmerous family; there be enlered into the rash youthful nouico, or thc lucklcss falher of a nvmerous family; their very In every town, who left the formerly affluct youth, torn srom the circle be adorned, cursing, in the solitudc of a dungeon, the fate that hcld drawn him within thereach of his friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speoking looks of mute hungry childron, without a single farthing of hif late lmmense weather, whether to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling toble; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just sriatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capoble of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day to boped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amldst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his ouriosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vairily wishing lobreak that mystery, which to his oxalted jmagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey far a time lostsight of his companion; he left him in a daily attendanoe upon the morning circle of Italian countries, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost desert city. While he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into this imagination that there was an evil power resident in his composition, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, roridered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had required to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pjnnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the\nAubrey det-\ncried upon leaving one, whose character had not yel shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the sarno circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly fermented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all bis windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him call the same time that was clear of being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, clearly laughed. Aubrey retircd; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remclinder of their proposed floor, he ordered his seruant to seek other apartmerits, arid calling upon the mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was protected. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; bul did not hint any fuspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, arid crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself iri tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltcring soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself,existed a beingso beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvafs the promised hope of the saithfl in Mahomcts paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much inind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountainside, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the onimal suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his searoh after antiquities, and often would the uncorisclous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the wbole beauty of hcr form, floating as it was upon the wind, ta the eager gaze of bim, who forgot the letters he had just decyphccd upon an almost effaccd tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as some flitted around, exhibit iri the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading, but might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who letescape from his mind that very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why ottempt to describe characters which all foel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffeeted by crowded drawing-roams and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, intracing the scenes of her native placo; she would then describe him the circle dancing upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, lurning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse Her carnestness and apparent belief af what she narrated, excited the iriterest even os Aubrcy; and often as she lold him the tale of the living vainpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forcedcvery year, by f eodjng upon the life af eodjng upon the life af appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believo her She detained to him this traditional appearance of these monsters, and this horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthuen; he, however, still persisted on persuading ber, that there could be no truth in hor fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all lended to excite a belief in the fupernative power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her lnnocence, so conlrasted with all the affected virtues of the women amang whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an vneducated Greok girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hjm. He would lear himself at timos from her, and, forming a plan for someantiquarian research, he would depart, deterrnined not to return until his object was attoined; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an iinage that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was unoonscious of his love, and was ever the same frank inflictile. being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite habits, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appealed to my parents and the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afler, Aubrey dotermined to proceed upon the orie of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, theyall at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most hocvy evils as a leading upori hjm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring task to mock a superior, inserrial power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext, inorning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his soul, and was concerned to find that biswords, mocking lhe belies of lhose harrable friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to doparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eornestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. Hewas, however, so occupied in bis research, that he did not peroeive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a lremeridous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted bis horse, determined to make up by speed for bis delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in hese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thundors had scarcely an interval of rcst—its thick heavy rclin forced its way through the conopying foliage, whilst there forked lightning season to fall and graduate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhaod of a hovel that bardly listed itself up from the rnasses of dead leclves arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the starm. If he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadsul shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifledled, exultanl mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost vnbroken sound ;—he wasstartled: but, roused by the thunder which agoin rolled over half head, he, with a sudden effort, forced upon the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; sor, though he called, still these sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried,\" Again baffled !\" ta whicb a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: detormined lo sel hif life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was left from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the grourid :—bis enemy thrcw himself upon him, and knecling upon his breast, hcld placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare The storm was now still; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his harror, when the light of the torches oneemore burst upon bim, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was about a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed the beam, stretchod by his side. There was no colour upori her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her focus thal seemed almost as attacking as the life that once dwelt there :—upon ber neck and breast was blood, and upan her throat were the marks of teelh having opened the vein :— to this the inner pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter waf quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now falling with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts wore—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger or a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lomentable crime, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Avbrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-bcarted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delicious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable emotion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecato maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis delirium, he was horrisied and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rutbven, by bis kind words, implying almost repenlance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by lhe attentian, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey pereeived no different ence from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of rnalicious exultalion playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this scandal hailed him During the last stage of this invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in inarking the progress of those orbs,circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to clvoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weaker, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul much as he wished for solilude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light ftep would appear waridering arnidft the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; thon suddenly turning raund, wovld show, ta his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assaciations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the lender because he had taken of hiin during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a resolution could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to hold what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only to inuentiori of individuals, whose interest it was to oxcite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence, after thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guides, more to serve as guides than as a defenco. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; so scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had lest them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, should begin to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven on Aubrey, imitating lheir exainple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: hut ashamed of being tbus detairied by a foe, who with insvlting shouts bade them advonce, being exposed to unresisting slaughter, is any of the robbers fhould climb abovc and take thom in tbe rear, they determined at once lo rvsh forward Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, rio longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robhers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ru, being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey saon induced them to convey his wounded friend to cl neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon cl ransom, who was no more disturbed by their presence—they being conlent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthenf strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed to be coping with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer his assistance with more than usual earneslness —\"Assist ine! you moy savo me— you may do more than that — I mean not my life. I need to be the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may savo my honour, your friends' honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do only thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little — my life ebbs apaee — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my horour were from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may say. \"— Then the eyes seemed bursting from their sheets :\"I swear !\" said Avbrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his health, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the pre sentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neigbbouring mount, aceording to a promise that had given bis lardship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that erased after his death. Avbrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the eorpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed out to the ideological rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in constructures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had renet with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten the lhal superstitious rnelancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himselsiri arranging those efforts he had with himbelonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of defence, more or less ada pted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. Whilst tvrning tbern over, and examining their curiaus forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamenled in the same style as the daggor discovered in the fcltal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it filted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyef seemed to need no further certainty—they seemod gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet slill he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same raying tints upon the haftand sheath werc alike in splendour on both,cland left no roorn far doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were claiming the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their forlune arrived, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubreysmind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose arid silent; and his only occupation consisted in varying the speed of the postingitions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hasteried to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ombraces and coresses of his sister, all the memory of the paft. If she before, by her infanline earesses, bad gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attacking as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gave the gaze and the opposite of the drawing-room assemblies. There was a nonc of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a cr owed apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to orise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul consciousness of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedalo and expensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breatbed to her his affection, and would iri bear presence forget those griefs. she knew he destroyed his rest, who would have exhausted her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the face were then playing in the light of their ownnative sphere. She was only yet eighteen, and had not been pres-\nented to the world, it was having been thought by her grandfathers more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the co-enter, when he might be a pralector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the right drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowed him. He would not feel intorost about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events which had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his father. They soon arrived in town, and pro-\nprepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing room had riot been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened them either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded like this ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast hiin, where he perceived, at a little distonce, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first country into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his harids upon his head, as he was afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstclnces started up in a dreadful array—thc dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not bel ieve it possible—tbe dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had injured up lhe imagined bis mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be reol—he determined, therefore, to go again in society; for thought he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon hif lips, and he could not succeed in gairiing information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roufed himself, and entering another room, found his sister surroved by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested to move, turned round, arid revealed to him that features he must be abhorred. He sprang forward, said bis sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the slreet: al the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while being engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"—Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, saon reached home.\nThe utery became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one doubt, how much more completely it was ongrossed, now that the certainty of the monstersliving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Hisoath startled hiin ;— was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert itsprogress? His very sister might have been touched by the film. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his shortcomings, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wrelch; but death, be remembered, had been already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her score, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stiffness and folitude, he left this house, roamed from the street to slreet, anxious to fly that irnage which haunted hirn. His dress became unexpected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to he recognized that first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever he had overtook him. His sister, anxious for his afety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who felt from a pursuer swelfter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the ideo that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst thein, of whose preserice they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into saciety, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarri, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimaey. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious lookswcre so striking, his i nward shudderings so visible, that his sister was also almost obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remaristriclence provod uriavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearling that hls mind was becoming alieriated, they thought it high time to resuine agairi that truft which had been before irnposed upon thein by Aubreys parents.\nDefirous of saving hirn from the lnjuries and sufferings he had d aily encountered in his wanderings, and preventing him from exposing to the gerieral eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take important care of him. He hardly appeared to criticize it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His influence became at last so great, that was confirmed to his chambor. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emociated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affoction and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of hif sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch her. \"Oh, do not touchhima—is your love for me aught, do not go near a blm !\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, whenceriot even though she could rouse him. This lastod rnany inonths: gradually, however, as the yeor was passing, hif incaherences hecame lefs frequent, and bis mirid threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardiorisobserved, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then sinile.\nThe time had rarely elapsed, when, upon the last day of the y ear, and of his gvardians entering his room, began to conv erso with his physician upon the meancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sis ter was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of retuming iritellect, of which they feared he bad hoen deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he hadmet with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to sec bis sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently agoin capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the seelings of the affeclion. He began to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evory accomplishment; where he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at behalding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking hjm why he thus destroyed the resemlance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —then seizing her honds, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countonance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, because he — Bvt he could not advance — it seemed af if lhat voice again bade him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round,  In the moanlime, the guardians and physiclan, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return to his disorder, entered, and forclring him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave her. He fell upon his knees to them, he improved, be bitten by them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and rotired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had before refused with everyone else. Wheri he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deceded insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companiori, arid, by constant atteridarice, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in this fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangcrf and toils to reeount—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any boing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom be addressed himself ;— could tell. how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seemworthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elderbronoh falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for bastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place every day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conveying her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the hanour of those now in the grave, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denaunced the mast heavy curses. The seruants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would better not to harass any more the mind of Miss A ubroy by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed ori without reply to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily conccived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the cuslody of an helpless old woman. Ho seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with grace. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\"Remember your oath, and know, if only my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are fair !\" So saying, he pushed them towards his attendants, wbo, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a suit, had broken blaodless, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemiized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the esfusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his first guardian might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he reacted composedly what the reader he pcrused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Mifs Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of the cold VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT DF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, & o.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Greoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18 l 2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, arid lhe certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmon; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, just bountles amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, ot the bottom of the bay, and whilst tho mcn were employed in watering, and thc purser bargaining for cattle with thc natives, the clergyinan and myself took a arclmble to be cove called Homers Scbool, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greekas our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me of a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. Tbo cottageover the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mari in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zecbines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not certainly; for he salls in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited ourcuriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our country had resided. We wore kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—ari entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious plot annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble lables on either side, a largo myrtle in the corner, and a small mountain heneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane children, arid an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fine painting. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closct: ll was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recesf lay Voltaire, Shakfpearef, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Empjres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parina in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantjnople, mucb tom, Most of these books were filled with marginol notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Mefsiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which alsowere the remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and sorgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so peculiar, that were I to move one thing without orders, be would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did hjin a service; and I had the produce of this sarm for the trouble of laking care of it, except twenty zechjnes which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wall, and whom the lord brought here from Adrionople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nct: The appearance of the house actually was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the left marble pilars with black plinths and fret-work corniccs ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath the air awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the hovse-tops are tbus furnished, as upan them, cheers pass their evenings in smoking,drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the houso, a small streamlet glided away, grapef, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of lorgc myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, tho lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for him was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small storm securing from the ruins descended in a broken case.\nades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smoolh as glass, and an horlzon unshodowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of loftychesnut and palm-trees, sevcralsmall islarids were distinctly observed, ftudding the light blue wave with spots of emerald region. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirios were fruitless as to the name of this person who had resided in this romantic soljtude: none knew his name but Domi nick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our corid author ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And carinot you tell, old friend ?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We do not have time to visit Armenian, but our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when which was last upon the island, and everyone danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borrows to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherrnan who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he corresponded to us, from all we collected, also has been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Once the circumstances we learnt, which our old friend at the college thought proper not to disclose. e :.. Hehad a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had thought of her piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSucb was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greeoe could be. He hadmoney it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which rnark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"Tbe iridival\", said he ,\" About whom yau are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited bim at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the rescue of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more serious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninleresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandcred. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the singer feelingsaf the heart, so elegantly depicted in this lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: arid his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion has set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"truists\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to half love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be roccived with oaution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrily; and he who dares justify himself before that awful trihunal whore all must appear, alone may censure the orrars of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-sleet.",
    "13": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did nat, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the lead becoming prevalent, that a Latiri body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and framed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extinct, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the Wcst just spread, with some slight variation, also over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nighlly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedilydied of consvmptianf; whilst lhese human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause tho blaod to\nIn the London Journal, of Marcb ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chlef and mogistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, at Cassavia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Sorvia, he had been tormented by a vompyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres gravo, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vainpyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, many people complained of having been tormented by bim, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (os is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely srees from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, clnd ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the aceustomed remedy. A stake was driveri entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they caught off his head, burned his body, and lhrew the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just, that a person sucked by a hammer becomes a vainpyrc himself, and sucks in his turn.\nct: Chlef bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapled to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal situation solely to lhose beings he loued most while upon earth — lhofe to wham he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A suppofition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathc the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victims, Where they do you expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing them, the flowers are w ithered on the stem. But one thing for the crime must fall. The yaungest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — Thal word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yel thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—hcr eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must ulew which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of ber yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affections fondesl pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnclshing tooth, clnd haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also intraduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting himshe bestloved whilst in existence-\nct sentence: But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayod through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracious Taurnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vamp yrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrativo of its effects, he put forth some leamed dissertatioris, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularlyhorriblc superstition might be added; though the present may suffiee for the Iimils of a note, neoessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be concludod by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul,\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the inside of the dissi-\nThe parents attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the town to a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attacked his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arase: some altributed it to thedead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a loaden ray that weighed upon the fkin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who were accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warinertint, eilher from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notaricty attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they might term affectlon: Lady Mercer, who had beeri the mockery of every monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marriage, tbrew herself in his way, But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex will indifferent to him: yet fuch was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knowhe ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the repulation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even outercame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who sorm to boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the riame of Aubrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl cllso to himself by guardians, who thought it their duly meroly to take caro of his fortune, while they relinquisbed the more important charge of bis mlrid to the carc of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of horour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed al 1 to sympclthise with virtue, and thought that vice was lhrown in by Providence merely for the pieturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in the field, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circle, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their languisbing or romping favourites: the daugbters at the same time, by their brigbtening conlenances when he approached, and by their sparkling oyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into folse notions of his talents and his merit. Attacbed cls he was to the romance of his salilary hours, he started finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from warit of snuffing, there was no foundotion in real life for the clny of that congeries of pleasing pietures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, ossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari taclt asserit to their existence nee, implied by tbe avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing lhat flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the affspring of his fancy, ratber t Hc became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far conceived upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of the preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his cvriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon cln equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, wheneuer scandalous intrigues are menti oned as the subjects of pleasantry They responded: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Finished by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in coinmori with other men, he gladly accepted it, and ln a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was profvsc in his liberally ;— the idlo, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immedlate wants. But Aubrcy could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the vlrtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant euen upon virtue, that he bestowed his alarms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich This was, however, altributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was an orie circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were also either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brusfels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which hls companion sought for the contres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he bctted, arid always gained more than he gained; but it was always witb the samo vnchangingface, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, sa when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father In every town, he left the formerly affluent youtb, torn from the oircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeori, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiond; whilst rnany a fathor sal frantjc, arnidst the speoking looks of mute hurigry children, without a single farthing this late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tablc; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of rnclny, the last gilder he had just snatched from a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experience ced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasuro which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosily, he obtained a rio greater gratitude from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which that his excllted imagination began to assurne the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of a bif companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of Italian countries, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Willst be was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonlshed hjm; is it had before entering into his imagination that there was an evil power reslderit in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered bis licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his conternpt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, lo enbance his gratification, that bis victim, tho partnor of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinnacle of unsullied vlrtuc, down to the lowest abyss of irifamy and degradation: in fine, that all thoso females whom had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, bad, since his departure\nAbbrecy determined uporileaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point ori which to rost the eye. He responds to invent some plavsible prefect for abanding him altogotber, purposing, in the mean while, watching bim more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soori perceivod that his Lordship was erideavouring to work upon the inexperience of the doughter of the Iady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is soldom that an unmorried female is mel with in society; he waf theresore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye allowed him in all his windirigs, and soori discovered that an assigriation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the rvin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no lime, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and ahruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he svposed clll would have upon such an occasiori; and upon being pressed whether he tended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a riote, to say, that from that moment, he must decline aceompanying his Lordship in the reinainder of their proposedtour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calliring upon the mother of the lady, informed her of al ho kncw, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the charaeler of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Rutbuen next day merely sent a hif servant to notify his complete assent to a separate; bvt did not hint any suspicion of his plans having heen foiled by Aubreyf interposllion.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps toward Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. Hc then fixed his residenee in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the field records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beclutiful and delicate, that she might have formed the mode 1 for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahoinetf paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for arily one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eyes, apparently the eye of an animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suiled but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconsciously girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gazo of him, who fargot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of a hor sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses folling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicotely brilliant and swiftly fading huef, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquar y, wbo let escape from his mind the very object he had before tho-\nThe length of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Portuguese. But why attempt to describe charms whichall feel, butnone can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-roorns and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing iri her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that bad evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural talef Hcr earnestness and apparent belicf of what she narrated, excitod the inlereft cven of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and deprivement tief, fo rced crow thc ensing months, bis blood would run cold, whilst he atteinpted to lclugh ber out of such jdle and horrible fantasies She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthveri; he, however, slill persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernaturous power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari uneducated Greek girl, slill sound himself more and more attached to the almost falry before him. He would tear himsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian research, he would depart, determined nat to retum until his object was attairiod; but he always found it impossible to fix his atte-\nnt ion upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful professor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from hirn with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, wbilst hcr guardian was occupied in skotching or uncovering some fragment which had yet esoaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; where they heard the name of the place, they all at once hegged him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through wood, where no Groek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of those vampyres in their nocturnal forces, and denounced the moft heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shoulder at his darling thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very naine of which apparently made their blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext, inorning Aubrey set ofs upon his excursion unattendance; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had infpired them with such a terrar. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged after him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into atremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for a hif delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southernclimatos, is almost unknown; immediately the seven sets, night begins: and where he had adva-\nnced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thundershad scarcely an interval of rest—ils thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying soliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took the flight, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fotigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exultant mockery of a laugb, continued in one almost unbro keri sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which agairi rolled over his head, he, with a sudden eff-\ncorrect, sourced the door of the hole. He found himself in outer darkness: sourid, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceiated; for, though he called, still. sounds continued, and no notice was taken as him. He found himself in contact with someone who he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\" Again baffled !\" to which a loud language succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose stren gth seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly af he could, he struggled; but it was invain: he was lifted from his seat arid hurled with enormous force against that. ground :—his company threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breath, had placed his hands upon his throat — when the glare of many torches penetraling through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rufbed through the door, and in the cold moment the crasbing of those branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, the incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the ballch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the defire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches became more bright upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visitor arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the sarne form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no calour upon her cheek, not even vpon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaehing as the life that once dwelt lhero :— upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having op oned the vein :— to this lhe men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of hcr who had lately been to hjm the object of so many bright and fajry versions, now failen with the flower of life thol had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were —his ring was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacclncy — he held olinost unconsciously in his hand, a naked daggor of a particular coristruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; but they died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was sejzed with a most violent sever, arid wcls often delirlous; in these iriteruals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his foreign coinpanion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his bead, and curse him as her doctor. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis dilriuin, he was horrified and ftartled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of aVornpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying olmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separalion, and still more by attention, anxiety, orid care which he showed, soon reeonciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ehanged; he no longer appeared that an approach bcing who hcld so astonished Aubrey; hut as soon as his convalefoence began to be rapid, be again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his game fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless svn ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the oycs of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rulhven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in lhe words, her light step would appear wandering amidst the undcrwood, in quest of the modest violet; lhon suddenly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale faco and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly the scenes, every structure of which caused such bitter assooialions in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, afraid to seek every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus havet-\nneed from place to place, yet they seemed to hold what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the inuention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus negleoling the advice of the inhclbitants, on one occasion they trauelled with only a few guards, make to serve as guides than as a defen case. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock broughl down from the neighbouring practices, they had the reason to reperit their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In the irislant their guards had left them, cold, placing themselves hehirid rocks, bad began to fire in the direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, re tired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defileful ashamed of belng thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, theydetermined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly, they had lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to bisstance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—hls guards hauing, upon Lard Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surreridored.\nBy the promise of great reward, Aubrey soon introduced them to corivey his wounded friend to a reighbouring cabin; and hauing agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificationensued, arid death seen advance with hasty stops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconfcious of pain class. he had been of the object about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently unoasy, and his eye often fixed uponAubrey, who wasinduoed to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist mc! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I — but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swcarby all your soul treasures, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockels :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; hc sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathod no mare.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did riot sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaint-\nance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a calm shivering machine over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaole of a nelghbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the sirst cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the suinmit, he found a trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some of his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but in the end, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspirod to heighten that superstitious melancholy total had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and the foon arrived at Smyrncl. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adaptable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the fame style as the dclgger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—haslening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, arid bis horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—thcy seen gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the samovarying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in sp lendour on both, and lofl no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe lest Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady which had ottempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the doparture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urgizing the speed of the postings, as if he were going to solve the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a hreezc, which seemed obedient to his will, foon wafted bim to the English shores; and he hastened to the monsion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey should not win the grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was noc of that light brilliantity which only exists in the beated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a meloncholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighterrealin. Her step was riot that light footing, which slrays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightcried by the smile of joy; but when the herbrother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence suggest those griefs she knew destroyed his rost, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and bad not being presented to the world, it was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her on a try into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the region of his fathers, and fed upon the mechanism which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionoble strarigers, when his mind had been so torn by the evontshe had wilnesfed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the proteclion of his sister. They soon arrived in Tokyo, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened a tbitber. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himfels, heedless of all around him, erigcled in the reinembrance that the first time had seen Lord Ruthuen was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voiee he recognized toa well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He should hardly have the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would hlast him, when he perceived a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his llmbs almost refusing to bear their weight, was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. Ho pacod the rooin with horrible steps, and fixed his hands upon his heod, as if he were afraid his thoughts were hurt from his brain. Lord Reveri again before him —circumstarices star-\nrtcd up in a dreadful array —the dogger —his oath .— He roused himself, who could not believe it possible — the dead riso again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthuen, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went after nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and he gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he refused himself, clrid entering another room, fourid his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him, whose features were most abhorred. He sprong forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurricd step, forced her towords the slreet: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erigaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did riot dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost a distraction. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sisters attentians were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more be thought, the more he wasbewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster toroar, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sifter might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes, strcoming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solilude, which left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. This dress became neglected, arid be wandered, or often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigued him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pressure swifter than any — from thaught. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idea that he lest by his obsence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whom they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his o ath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard arid suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that this sister was at last obliged to beg of help to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a local society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavcliling, the gvardians thought pro per to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the lnjuries and sufferings he had daily encounter in his wandering gs, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye lhose marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to refide in the house, and toke the correctant area of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, because completely was hif the mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became almost so great, that he was confiried to his chamber. Thero, he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes hod atlairied clglassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that sevorely affected hor, he would desire hor nat to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me just aught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! Thrive !\" and again he sank into a state, a sentence not even could be rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became a loss frequent, and his mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite riumber, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avhreys being in such an awful situation, when a sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the Internet, af which they feared he had been depriued, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in soolety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonlshed them still more by expressing his intention to be present of the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his first was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feclings of affection. He began to speak with all bis wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upori her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he also destroyed the resemblarice of hcr futurehvsband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this rnonster, for he— But he could not advance—it seomed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turried suddenly raun d In the meantime, the guardians and physiciari, who hadheard the wholc, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to deloy, but for a nice day. They, attempting this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to play him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be confused from those among whoin he had planned this inforination. He congratulated the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dangers and toils to recount—could fpeak af himself as of an individual having rio sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her lo who he addressed hiinself;—could lell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to feel warthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her sootbing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important company, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of the hcr brother's deranged stote ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for thecontinent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician arid his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she gave her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which hedenounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; bulgiving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of this house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last over came to their village. They gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He scized the opportunity, with the rope bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurriedhim from the room, speech-\na teacher with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his head —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride that day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. That was not inentioned to his sister, who was not present when he ontered, as the physician was afraid of agilating beer. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisler guardjans might be called, and when the midnight hour had ftruck, he related composodly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was called before him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majestyf vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the barbour of Mitylene, on the island of that naine. The beauty of this placo, and the certainly supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels tovisit it—both men of war and merchonlmcn; and though it lies rather out of the lrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounlies amply repay sor the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the power bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us to come from Scia with an English lord, who left the jsland four dclys preuious to our arrival iri hls se 1-\na clue. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He is an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( obo ut L 250 English currency ), and has rcsided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account exposed our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in the hostening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drowing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet repaired. They were clll simply decorated: ploin green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the bronebes by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venvs in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood half a dozen English cane chairs and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had nearly a large mattress spread on the blue floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the cornmon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed cl marble process. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in cl large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think oursolves just filled in oxamining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajres, Shokspeare's, Boileau, and Rovsseau's workf complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Canstantinople, rnuch torn, but Most of these books were filled with margirial notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with sllps of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old mcln said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lle until his return; sor he is sa parliculclr, that were I to move any thing withoutordors, he would frownvpon me for a week together; he is othorways very good. I once made him a service; and I have the procedure of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who relies on a single cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paces, lang and fourteeri brocld, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corniccs ,( as just is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine cherry carpet, beneath an awning of the most rong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus finished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the convenient breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shadc of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with on ornamental w ooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve ooclock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for him was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyardsled the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees, iri bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decay. A small ftream issuing from the ruins descended in the broken cascades, until it waslost in the wood near the mountain base. The sea smootb as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; arid a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chosnut and palrn-trees, several single islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Tbe Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"couldtell, but I am sure he willnot ,\"—\"And cannol you tell an old friend?\" said I —\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on over return to the town, we learnt several particulars of the isolated l world. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a look to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and bonevolent character. Orie circumstances we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought the proper only to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom there was often seen walking from the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the vse of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peaceful side of Mitylene; our imagination.\nations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. How had money it was euldently had a philanthropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived the city Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr . FDSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he,\" about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels, an thc island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every place. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at that stage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uriinteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling decision, averso to associating withburnan nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his home. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his eourting the repose of solitude is cln additional reason sor marking him as cl being on whose heart religion hath set her sea, and over whose head, Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with action, particularly where directed against moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do goodin secret, arid shun that world's applause, is the surest testimany of a virtual heart arid self-approving coriscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "14": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians, it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wanderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hvngary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedy diod of consumptions; whilst tbese human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as ta cause the blood to flow from\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, thatupon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arno told Paul, had been heard to say, that, called Cassovicl, on the frontjers of the Turkish Service, had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyr-\na grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyrc himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people coinplained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four porsoris had been deprivcd of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagnj, took up the bady, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and melting at the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and floridbload. Proaf having been thus obtairiod, they rosorted to the accusomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the causes of those people who had previously died from vompyrisin, lest they should, iri their turri, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrovs rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for somo heinous crimc committed whilst in oxistence, that tbe deceased is not only doorned to vampyrise, but eompelled to confine his infernal vifitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by tics of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,Thy corfe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood ofall thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, Atmidnight drain the stream of life; Yet loatbe the banqvet with perforce. Mvst feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere tbey yel expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy slowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the crime must foll, the you gest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless the with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou mvst on the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Whicb freezcs over its lifcless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock wben shorn Asfections of the ndest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thineagony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashiring tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—arid with Gous and Afrits rave, Till thiso in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey bas also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", which vampire the Arabian maid. Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved wealth in existence. But this cannot be supposed to be resulled from the sinfulness of her life, being poured throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he preterids to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionary narrclatives of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious andinteresting notiees on this sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limils of a note, necesfarily devoted to explclnation, and which rnoy riow riow bc conclvded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in rool general acceptance, there are several other synoriymous with it, madc use of\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the middle of the dissipatians attendant upon a London writer, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for his singularities, than bis rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughler of the fair only attracted his attenlion, that he might by a laak level it, and tbrow fear into those breosts whero thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of owe, could not explain whence itarose: sorne attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce there.\nugh to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a clean ray that weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accuslomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their prefecture of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly burden of his faeo, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of possjon, though its form and outline were beaulisv 1, many of the female hunters after notoriety altempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe moc kery af every mood before him, though his eyes were apparently flood Even though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparentcaution with which he spoke to the vlrtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he had ever addressed his smiles to semales. He had, however, the reputatiori af a winni ng torigue; and whether it was that it even overcarned the dread af hls singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was as often among thoso semales who form the boast of their sex from thejrdomestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nA bout the same train, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aub Rey: he was an orphan left with cln only sisler iri the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lest also talk himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgmerit. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour, arid candour, which daily ruins so many million applicants. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought thal uice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scerie, as we see in romarices: he thought thal the misery of a cottage morely consisted of the vesting of clothos, which were af warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eyes by their irregulor folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was haridsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, striuing which should describe with least through their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of hif solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the taxi and waxcandles that flickered, not from the present of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of ploasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in bis gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHc walched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in bimsclf, who gave a few other signs of his abservation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensily to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, clnd determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of the preparation trip — Sleet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiofity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for her to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to onable the young to take some rapid steps in the care of the vice towards putting themselves upon an equcllity with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as is fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous iritrigucs are mentioried as the subjects of pleasantry or of They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from a bim, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly also accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the crocling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now be found, that, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed snee rs; bul wheri the profligatecame to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to follow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his inivity, he was sent away with rich charity This was, however, attributed to him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the reliring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was acurse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns tbrough which tbey passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his campanion sought for the centres of all fasbioriable vice; there he entered into oll the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the knownsharper was bis clntclgonist, clnd then he lost even more thclri he gained; but it was alwclys with In every town, he left the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle be adorried, curfing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn bim wilhiri the reacbof this friend; whilst mony a fatber sat frantic, among the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, lhe last gildor he had just snatcbed from the corivulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of combating the running of the more experienced. Aubrey ost en wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasuro which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; he dclayed it—for each day he bopod his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to hiin; however, lhis never occurred. Lord Ruthven iri his carriage, and almost the uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and lhough Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no groater gratification from lt than the conftant oxcitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assumcthe appearance of the same thing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived call Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost desorted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatienoe; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affectjon; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had become entered into his irnagination that there was an evil pawer resident in his companion, these seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his imrnodiately leaving his friend, clrid vrged, that his character was dreadfully curious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contccred, that his contccred, that his contcct for the odultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sine, that all those fernales whom ho had sought, apparently on account of their uirtue, hod,\nAubrey deterrnined upon leaving the orie, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoriing hjm altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let rio slight circumstances poss by urinoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeauouring to work upon the iriexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house ho Chi-\nct: fly frequently. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female if met with in society; he will therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appreciated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him that fame time that was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment must declino accornpanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his fervant to seek other apartments, and oalling upon the rnother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with r regard to the hor daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hintany the special of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interpasition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dirocted his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himsels at the news. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Groek; and soon occupied hiinself in tracing the faded records of aricient glory upon monuments lhclt correspondingly, afhamed of ohronicling the deods of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the fame roof as himself, existed a bein g, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too muchmind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she sed upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazolle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her oye, apparently the eyc of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the onimal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe often accompanied Auhrey in his seat after antjquities, and often would the uncanscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her forrn, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the oontemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofton would her tresses fcllling, as she flitted around, exactly in the sun ray such a dolically brilliant and fwlftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of cl passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms with all feel, but the rione can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains os which wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic esfects of his pencllin tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would pairit, to him in all the glowing oolours of youthful memory, the rnarriago pop she remembered viewing ln her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a grecl Her earnestness and apparent helief of what she narrated, excited the interest cven of Aubrey; and often as she lold him lhc tale of the living vompyre, wbo had passed years clfttempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fontasies; but Ianthe cited him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among tbemselvos, af ter several of their near relatives and children had b She detajled to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and this horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthucn; he, howcver, still presisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wanderedat the many confidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernative power of Lord Rulhveri.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianlhe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affeeted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hahits, morrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hlm. He would tear himsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found impossible to six his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Daniel was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no loriger any one with whom she could visit her favourile haunts, which her guardian wasucced in sketching or uncovcringsame fragment which had yel escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents from the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the uampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils as imponding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superjor, infornal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood free e, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set aff upon his excurfion unatterided; he was surprised to observe the molclncholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends,bad j inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of hlm to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so involved in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would saori end, arid that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted bis borse, determined to moke up by speed for this delay: but ll was loo late. Twilight, ln these southern climates, ls almost unknawn; immodiately l the sun sets, nighl begins: arid ere he had adrained far, the power of the storm was clbove—its eohoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavyrain forced its way through tho cariopying faliage, whilst the blue forked light seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the eritangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a havel that hardly lifled itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brusbwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the tbunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stisled, exullant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;— he started: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succecded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he strv gled; bul lt was in vain: he was lifted from his seat and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upori his breclsl, had placedhis harids upon his throat — when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole thal gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he inslantly rose, and, leclving bis prey, rushed thr through the door, and in a moment the crash The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was saon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torch fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her eries; he was again left in darkness; but whot was his harror, when the light of thetorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair coriductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, bending that it was bvt cl vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he ogain saw the same forrn, when he unelosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yct there was a stillness about her sace that seemed almost as attoching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her rieckarid br east was blood, and upon her throal were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the meri pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to hirn the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflectlon, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had boon found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom the other had finished. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some cruel catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed was soized with a most violent feucr, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord. Ruthven found upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable cornbination he seemed to hear of his former companion to spare them being he loved. At other times, he would appreciate maledictions upon his head, and curse them as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chancedat this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon heclring of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himsels in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their soparation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite ohanged; he no longer appeared that apalhetic beirig who had so astonished Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence bogon to be rapid, ho again gradually retired into the sclme slclte of mind, and Aubroy perceived no difference between the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intenly upon bim, with a smile of malicious exvltation playing upon his lips: he knew During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coaling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the thal elasticity of fpirit which had once been distinguished since now seemed to have slod for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but inuch as he wished for salitvde, his mirid cauld not find it in the neighbovrhood of Atbens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he hod formerly frequented, Iarithcs form stood by hls side—if he sought it in the wods, her light step would appe ar wondering amidst tbe underwood, in quest He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthucri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They traveled in every direction, and sought an euery spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus haslencd from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on the original occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon the entry-\ning, however, a narrow def-\nwhile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were started by the whlstling of bullets clofe to their hoads, and by the echoed report of sevoral gains. In an instant, their guardf had left lhem, and, placing themselves bebind rocks, had begun to fire the iri blue direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven clnd Aubrey, lmitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed af boing thus detained by a foe, who with lnsulting shouts bade them oduance, and being exposed to unreslating slaughter, is the army of the robbcrs should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hclstened to his assistance; and, no longer hceding the contest or bls own peril, was soon surprised by sceing the rabbers' faces around him—his guards hauing, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to envy his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, which was no more dislurbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the pramised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the mortification ensued, and death feemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; be seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the lasl over the evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness — Assist me! you may save me — you wanna do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honor, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs opace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you wouldconceal all you know of me, my horour were free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I — but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, sor a year and a day you will not import your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon the pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey retired to resl, but did not sell eep; many circumstances attending his acquairitance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering carne over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was able to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon hif retiring, to be pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, aeoording to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first old ray of the moon that rose after his death. Harry aftonished, and taking several of the men, determined togo and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when hc had moun ted to the summit, he found no troce of either the corpse or the clathes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the jdentical rock ori which they had laid the body. For a time, my mind was bewjldered in conjeclures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had huried thecorpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to hear that superslitious melancboly that had seized upon his mind, be resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to LordRuthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of affance, more or less odated to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at sinding a shcoth apparently ornamented in the samestyle as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the wcapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the fheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they secmed gaziring to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbeljeve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He became more rose and silent; and his only occupatiori cansisted in urging the spoed of the poftilions, as if he were going to save the lise of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seomed obcdient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastoned to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a momerit, appearedod tolose, in the einbraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she besore, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the womari began to appear, she was still inore attachingcls a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye will never lit up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was a melaricholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that applied to indlcate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighteried by the smile of joy; but when her brother breothed to her hls affection, and would join her presence forgct those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the vocabulary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet orily eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it has been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the opoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the melancholy which ovorpowered him. He could not feel interested in the friuolities of fashjoriable strangers, when his mind had been so torri by the contents he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protector of his sister. The son arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room bad not being held for a long time, and all who were anxious to book in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. Wbile ho wcls standing in a corner by himself,heedless of all around him, engaged iri thc remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had a hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, which was obliged to take the form of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driving home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven agairi before him—ciroumstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had injured vp the magic his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to look concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a cold a few nights after with his sister to the assombly of a near relationship. Leaving her order the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, al last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in the eamest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door which found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were willing for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to hirn —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before this mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her who had caused his abrupl coriduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was a bewildered. His oath started him ;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin vpon bis breath, almost all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, arid disclose bis, a serious person, who wouldbelieve him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a cold wretch; but death, he remembered, had been mocked. For days, he reinained in this state; shut up in his room, be saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wha, with eyes streamling with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At lost, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, helest his house, roamed from the street to street-\ntext, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became rejected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with lhe everything to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overloak bim. His sister, colleagues for his safety, employed people to follow a bim; but they were soon distanced by a bim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. Hi, conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by hif absence the whole of his friends, with a friend ainongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approacbed with intimacy. But when he entered the inlo room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at least obliged to beg of him to abstain from sceking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrarice p proved unavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was beeoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that the lrust which had been before imposed upon thein by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encounter in his wandorings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conslarit care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, to completely lose his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie some days, incapable of being roused. He had become complicated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and reeollection remains displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do riot go near him !\" Where, however, she inquired to whom referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True!\" and again he spoke into a slate, whence not ever a shock could rouse him. This Iasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, while his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wheri, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering this room, began to converse with his physician upon the melanoholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful situation, when his fister was going the next day to be married. Instontly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to swim. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared which had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avbrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to hc present at the nationals, and dcsiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. Hc was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother being once more alivo to the feelings of affoction. Hc began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon ber marriage with a person sa distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon ber breast; opening it, what was his surprise as a b eholding the features of the mo nster who had so long influenced life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled ill under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblarice of her futvrc husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —then seizing her bandf, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, be bade her swear that she would never wed this inonster, for he — But he could not advarice — it seemed as if lbat voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned sudderily round, In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard this whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, cntered, and forcing him from Mifs Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he ignored, he begged of them that delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, redeemed to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of lt; but whon he learned that he was deemed insarie, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be coricealed from those among whom he had given this information. He hostened the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of a great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could spoak of himself as of an individual h aving no sympathy with any heing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;— could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were mercly that ho rnight lislen to her soothing occents ;— fine, be knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of fate The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which she served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged slate ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAvbrey, when he was left by the physielan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, corijuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honor, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours last marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought just better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey hy, what he oorisi dered, the ravings of a manioc. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of this house; arid Aubrey heard, with a horror that more eosily be eonceived than doscribod, the notes of husy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriage broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of tbe servants clt last overcame their violence, they gradually stole clway, leaving him in the oustody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bourid, was out of the room, and in an inoment found himself in the opartment where the hall was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceivo him: he immediately approached, found, taking a hif arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your death, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken bloodless, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the politician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegrooinleft London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, arid when the midnight hour had struck, he related cornposedly when the roader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world wasal 1 before the train, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majcsty's vessels, in the year 112, we put into the harbour of Mit-\nylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle arid vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit jt—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, lots bountjesamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and which the men wore employed in watering, and the purser borgclining for cattle with natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island fourdays previous to our arrival in his felucca. ct :\"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottageover the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English eurreney ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in listening to the house where our countryman had resolved. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted the need of over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sittingparlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closct and annexed. They were also simple. d ecorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tabl ef on either side, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a small sountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small brorize Vonus in a leclriing pofture; a large couch or fofa completed the furriiture. In this hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a lorge mattress spread from the floor, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the oommon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the clofet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examination the contents. On the tablet of the reoess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Empires; Zimrnerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebucs novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Ilalian edition, printed at Parma in l 810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tor Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man sclid :\"The lord had been reading these books that evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his rctum; for he is so porticular, that were I to move onc thing without orders, he would frown upon ine for a week longer; he isotherways very good. I once did him a service; afraid I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an older Armenian who recsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty pages long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black paint and fre-\nl-work comics ,( as it is now a customary in Green arohilecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrode, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops arc thus surnished, as uponthem these Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusterling together on its borders, and under the shade of lwo large myrtle bushes, a marhle seatwith an ornameritaIwooden back was placed, on which we were told, the Lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelvo clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always altended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a birdeye view .\" A line of rich vineyardsled the eye to Mount CaIcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshodered by a single eloud, terminates the view in front; and a little an tbe left, through a vista of lofty cbesnul and palm-trees, feveral srnall islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald greeri. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If Ican\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had porlioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even drew with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to those who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whoin the lord, was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the music of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful life of MityIene; our imaginations all on the rock, guessing who this rambler in Greeco could be. He holds money, it was unexpected: be a bad philanthropy of disposilion, and all those eccentricities which inark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tcnedos, and I also visited him at Mltylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put only our hands to recognize the recluse of C local iri every page. Deeply did we regret nothaving been more curious in our research at the eoltoge, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is quite uninterefting, and in justice to bis lordships good nome, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as anunfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gothered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his room. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to give all his actions: and his oourting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her soul, and ovor whose head Beneuolence hath lhrownher maritle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral inlegrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where also must appear, alone may censure the errors of a sellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGjllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "15": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is foundod is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present sorm since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could riot correct if you tried in their territory, it gradually increased, and sormed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dcad rising from their graves, and seeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, wbo became emclciated, lost their strength, and spcedily died of consu mptions; whilst these human blood-suekers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of replotion, as to cause the bload to flow from\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1923, is a curious, one, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hung-\nct: diary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively arid unanimously affrmed, that, about five years before, a ccrlain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkisb Service, had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way torid himself of theevil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyres grave This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormonted by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrlsm) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the inouth, ruse, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported that he had cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopled with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nct: Chief hailiff.\nThis monftrouf rodomonlade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece just is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed wbilst in existence, thal thc deceased is not only doorned to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visltations solely to those beings he loved rnost while upon earth — those to whom bewas bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition oluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy corse sball from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, Arid suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathc the banquet which perforce Must feed thy living co rse, Tby victirns, where they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; But the orie that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best believed of all, shall bless thee with a father's name — Thot word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last linge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes our lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affections foridest pledgowos worn—But now is born away by the Memoricll of thine agony! Yet with their own hest blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then stalking to tby sullen grave, Go — and with Govls and Afrits rave, Till lhese in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vompyre eorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. Bul this cannot be supposed to have refulted from lbe sinsvlness of her life, she being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocerioe. The veracious Tourriefort gives a long account in his lravels of several astonishing cases of vclrnpyrism, to which be pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth from learnod dissertotlons, tending to prove just to be a classical, or well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting noliees on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuolcd to explanation, and which may now be concluded hy inerely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, the re are several other synonymous with it, made use of in uarjovs parts of the world: Cls Vroucolocha, Vardaulachcl, Goul, Broucolo\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the leaders of the ton a nohleman, more remarkable for his significance, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could only participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the four only attracts his attention, that he might by a look level it, arid throws fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this fensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to pe netrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the beart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; also wished to see a hirn, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blufb of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, lhlks of what they inight term affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the rnockery of every monstcr shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herfelf in his way, and did all but pul ori thc dresf of a mountebonk, to attract hls notice  But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caulion which was spoken to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter,thal fewknew he ever clddressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputaliori of a winning longue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vlce, who was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, os among those who usually it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also tohimself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to lake care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltems, which cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour, arid candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed also to sympathise with virtue, and thought that uico was thrown in by Providonce merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely corisisted on the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of people were the realities of life. Hc was haridsorne, frank, and ricb: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least the truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, arid by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attaobed as he was to the rornance of his solilary hours, was started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles thcltflickered, not from the presence of a ghast, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleas-\ning pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in bis gratified antity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his care er.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, wbo gavo a few other sigris of his observatiori or external objects, than the tact assent to their existence, implied by tbe avoidarice of their contact: allowing his imogination to pioture everything thal flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romancc, and determined to observe the offspri He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveris affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, then he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this fingulclr character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was tiine for him to perform the lour, which for many generat ions has been thought necessary to eriable the young to take some rapid steps in the ooreer of vice towards putting lhemselves uponan equality with the aged, arid not allowed them to appear as if fallen from the skics, whenevor scandal They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intenlions to Lard Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esleem from hell, who, apparently, had nothing in common with othermen, he gladly accepted it, arid in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHithorto, Aubrey had had a radio opportunity to study Lord Rulhven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to this view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse iri bis liberally ;— the idle, the vagaborid, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon thevirtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed bis alms ;— he was sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when he profligate carno to ask something, not to relieve his wanls, but to clllow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he waf sent This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevailed after the retiring hashfulness of the virtuous indigont. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevilably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were called either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizod at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashioriabe vice; lhehe entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was hjs antagonjst, and then he lost cven more tbon he gained; but it was always with the saine unohanging face, with which he generally watched In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungean, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many fathers sat frantically, amidst the speaking loo ks of mute bungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gamhling tablo; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he badly just snatched from the lheconvulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the moro experienced. Aubrey often wishes to represent this to a bis friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of the cell, and did not terid to bis own. profit ;— but he deloyed it — for each day hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this river occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sceries of riature, was always the same: his eye spoke lefs than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he ohtained no greater gratificcltion from it than the correctant excitement of vainly wishing to break that inystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, which he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he operied with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before enlered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him a sufsicie next reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully viclaus, for that the possession of irresistible power of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, thal his contempt for lhc adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that bls victim, the partner of his gvilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, lhat all those semalef whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtuo, hod\nAubrey detormined upon leavingorie, whose character had not shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mental while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that if Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is a seldoin that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubroy's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an examination had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruiri of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing rio time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inten tioris were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, inerely laughed. Aubrey relired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remclinder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and colling upon the mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also conceming the character of his Lordship. The assignment was presented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify bls complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He they fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glary upan monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen orily besorc slaves, had bidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as hiinself, existed being, f0 beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray ori canvass the promised hope of the fajthful in Mahomels paradise, save lhat her eyes spoke too much mirid for any one to think she could belong to those who bad no fouls. As she dclnced upon the plane, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of anjmated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suiled but the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashrnere butlerfly, shaw the whole beauty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of hjm, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered upon an almost effective tablet, in the expectation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her stress falling, as she flitled around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the ontiquary, who let escape from his mind, the very object he had become thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe the charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crawded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he will shed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effocls of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; sbe would then describe him the circling dance upon tbe open pain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful momory, the marriage pomp she reinernbered viewing in her infancy; and tben, turning to subj ects that had evidently Her earnestness andapparent belief of what she narrated, oxcited the iriterest even af Aubrey; and often cls she told bim the tale of the living vampyre, who had pasfed yeors amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every ycar, by fceding upon the life of a long month, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugb her out of such idle and horrible fclnta She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monslers, and his horrar was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lard Rutbven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the mariy coinoidences which had all tended to excito a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey b began to attach himself more and more to Iantho; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the women ainong whom he had sought for a hif vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still who found himsels more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hirn. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan sor some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impassible to fix his attention upon theruins around him, whilst in his mind he retoined an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first knawri. She always seen that part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, a couple with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was also detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of lhe pl aee, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a word, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upan any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vompyres in their national origins, and denounced the most heavy ovilf as impending upon the hlm who dared toross their palh. Aubrey made a light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the ideal; but when he sclw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infe-\nsmall power, the very name of which apparently moded their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had irispired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Iarithe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to bc put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spocks whieh, iri tho warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at 1 clst, however, motivated his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; irnmediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advancedfar, the power of the storm was abovc—its echoing the ndors had scarcely an interval of rest—lts thick heavy rain forced its way through the oanopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightriing seemed to fall and reduce at his very feel. Suddenly, his harse took fright, and he was careful with a dreadful cripidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of fighting, thal he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to find some rope to guide a bim to the town, near at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman smiling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokeri sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hul. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unper-\nreceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Agclin ba ffled !\" to wh which a loud laugh succeoded; and he felt himself grappled by someone whose strength seemed superhuman: determlended to sell his life os dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet andhurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, hod placed his honds upon his throat — when the glare of mariy torches penelrat The storm was still now; and Aubrey, the incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torchos fell over the mud walls, arid the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the dosire of Aubrey they fearched for her who had attacked him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upan hiin, to perceive the airy farm of his fair conductress brought a lifeless course. Ho shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw some form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was nocolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upori herthroat were the marks of the eeth having opened the uein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! Varnpyre !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew what hif thoughts were —his mind was benumbed and seemed to have a reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—ho held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hul. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe your grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained such a cause of their blood death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the eorse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and wcls often dolirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ionthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former cornpanion to spare the being he loved. Al other times, he would imprecote maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon the healing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose name he had now compared with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, employing almost repentarice for the fault that had caused lheir separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wha had so astonished Aubrey; but af soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious oxullation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the individual recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or ln marking the progress of thoso orbs, circling, like our world, the movelefs sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys indeed, by this shock, was rnuch weakened, and that elasticity of spiril, which bad once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a love of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find jt in the neighbourhood of Atheris; if he sought il amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianlhes form stood by his side—if he sought il in the woods, her light step would oppear waridering amidft the underwood, in queft of tbe modest violet; then suddenly turning rovnd, would show He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assocations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they shouldvisit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hadcncd from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upori. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the gerierosity of those who they desended from pretended darigers. In consequence of thus negotiating the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, bowever, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock bravghl down from neighbouring practices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; farscarcely were the whole of the party engoged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guris. In an instant, their guards held them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired sor a moment behind the sheltering tvrnof the defile: but clshamcd of being thus detainodby a force, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they detormined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad, they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no loriger heeding the control or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord, even being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendcred.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content inerely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Rutbvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with basic steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was introduced to offering bis assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need a little —my life ebhs apace — I cannot explain tbe whole — but if you would co nceal all you know of me, my bonour were free from stain in the warlds moulh — and if my death were uriknown for soine time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exutant violence ,\"Sweor by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; he many circumstances attonding his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if he had forgotten the presentiment of something horrible awailing bim. Rising eorly in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he had left the corpse, when a robher met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conueyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbor, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the sirst cold ray of the moon that rose after bis death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of them men, d remained to go and bury lt upon the spot where it said. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trclco of either thecorpse or the clothes, though the robhers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid their body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had burled the carpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country land which he had met with such terrible misforturies, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancholy that had seizod upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or that Naples, be occupied himself in arraringing those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Revheen. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offer, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilsl turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal but—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he sound like weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, tough peculiarly shaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyef seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed to need gazing to he bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on the bath, and left no room sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left S Maryrna, and on his way home, left Rome, his first linquiries were concerning the lady he had atte-\nadapted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seducative world. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and he had not beenard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He became morose and silerit; and his only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the postilions, as if both were going to save the life of someone he beld dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soan wafted bim to the English sbores; and hehastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraees and caresses of his sister, all inemory of the past. If she before, by her infanline caressef, had carried his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching a cousin.\nMiss Aubrey bad not that winning grace which gains the value and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye will never lit up by the levity of the mind, berieath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misforturie, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul conscious of a hrighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was fedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her bis afsection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed bis rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own nalive sphere. She was yel only eighteen, arid had not been present to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from this continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered hern. He could not feel interested in frivolities or fashion.\nonable strangers, when his friend had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened together. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he waf stariding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the rememhrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthuen was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly scized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectrc that would blost him, when heperceived, at a little distance, some figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first eritryinto society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forciring a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were hurt from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstancos started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the irnage his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he was altempted to ask the enchanting Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he would not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leoving, he refused himself, and entering another room, found his sisler surrouridod by several, apparently in earnest conuersaliori; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features hemost abhorred. Hc sprang forwclrd, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, foroed her towards the street: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged inpassing them, he again heard that voice whisper class to hiin —\"Remernber your oatb !\"— He did not dare to learn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached horne.\nThe baby became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it erigrossed, nowthal the certointy of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentionswere now uriheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a cold few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starlled horn ;— was he then to allow this rnonster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, against all he held a dark, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his suggestions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this slate; shutup in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing skills and solitude, he left his house, roamed from the street to the street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whatever fatigue overtook him. His sister, arixious forhis safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intlmacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so ulsible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her s role, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to iriterpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming olienated, they thought ithigh time to resume again that trust which should be before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wariderings, arid of preventing them from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His iricoherence became to the last so great, that he was confirmed to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, the importance of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affeotion and recolleotion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his father; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me is about, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his ordinary answer was ,\"True! true !\" and again, he sank into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, cls the year was passing, his incoherences became less frcquent, and his mind lb rew off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the daily he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe train had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converso with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, where his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey attention was attacked; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished from still more by his expression of his religion. also he presents at the riuptials, and desires to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again the capablo of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her asking bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with cl sraritic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wear this monster, for he — But he could riot advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember hls oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of this disorder, concerned, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, decided her to leave him. He sells upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay the hurt for one day. They, attracting this to the insonity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deeined irisane, his cultation and pleasure could hardly be coricealod from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mifs Avery. Who could resist his power? His to ngue had dangers on toils torecount—could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, sclve with her to whom he addressed himself ;— could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy ofpreservation, if it were inerely that he might listen to her saothing accenls ;— fine, he knew so woll how to use lhe The little of the elder branch sallingat length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse sor hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged stato ,) which was to take place every day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to bis sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the mostheavy cursos. The servant promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what be considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passedon without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that many more casually be concerned than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of the circles broke up his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants to last overcame their vigilanee, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He said the opportunity, with one bound wos out of the room, and in a moment, he himself in the apartment where all was nearly asfembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: who immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When I took the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. women are fair !\" So crying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad come in search of a bim. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was a riot present when he was eritered, as the physician was afraid of agiating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bike and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakries increased; the effect of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader who perused him — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and the Aurcy's sister had glutted the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of the name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and mercharitmen; and though it lies rather out of a blue track for ship bourid to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the pursor bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had beenhcforo. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely. to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wire-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost a long time since I had been listening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an enlrance hall, a drawing-rooin, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stclined walls, marble tables on the cilber side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain beneoth, which could be mode to play through the branches by moving a spring sixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In that half stood half a dozen English cane cbairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bcd throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were there in a large secret chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exaining the contents. On the tablet of the recess 1ay Voltajres, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volncy Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues riovels; Sehiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tor Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, arid inarked with the slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe ald man said :\" The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed.\ned, clnd forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie unlil bjs return; for he is so p ortlculor, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I onco did him a service; and I have the product of this farm for trouble taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to anaged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nct: The appearance of the house was actually pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen brood, and the fluted marble plolars with block plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considered higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrado, was covered by a firie Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the hovsellops are this furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, suchas \"lachryina chrisli\", eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small slar-\neamlet glidcd away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bufhes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the 1ord passed many of his evenings clnd nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout,\" and always gathered our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThis view from this seat was what may be tormed \"cl birdeye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive vine and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared like majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was losing the woods near the mountain baso. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed the view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, bis bankor, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armen Ian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" said I —\"If I can,\" said to be ,\" I dare not .\" We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the folated lord. He had portioned eight young girls who he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one month, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testarnerits to the poor child ren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend al cottago thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shoro, and he had bought her a piano-storage, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylone; our imaginations all on the rack, guossing with this rambler in Greece could be. He had rnoney it was evident: he hod the philanthropy of disposition, arid all those economics which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt andGreece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recuse of Calcla on every page. Deeply djd we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it riots quite uninleresting, and in justice to his worships good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as an unfceling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordsbips poems, seems to have their seat in this bosom. Tenderricss, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religian hoth set her scal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown beer mantle. No inan even read the proceeding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of afhim of a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not save the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caulion, particularly late when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellloomy. Lord Byron's character iswarthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleel-street.",
    "16": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy Jonathan Polidorj.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is found is very general in the East. Among tho Arabians just appears to be common: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Grecks until afler the establishment of Christjanity; arid it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which lime, the idea becoming prevalent, that o Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feoding upon the blaod In the Wost it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hurigary, Poland, Australia, and Lorraine, where the helief existsod, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certainportion of the blood of their victims, wbo became einaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human lood-suckers sattened—and their velns became distended to such a state of repletion, as to ccluse\nIn this London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curlous, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyri-\nsm, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, thal upori ari examiriation of the eommander-in-chief and magistrales of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named A rnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cofsovia, on the fronliers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a wcly to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of This precaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by hjm, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To p reuenl surther mischief, the inhabitants having consulted lheir Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as also supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to accustomedremedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopled with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they sbould, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a hammer himself, and sucks iri his lurn.\nct: Chief Bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better compared to illustrate the subject of the present observotions than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishmerit after death, for some heinous crimo committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to lhose beings he loved most while upon oarth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindr ed and affection .— A supposition allowed to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut firston earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse sholl from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the ftreain of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As curs The flowers are wltbered on them. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—hcr eye's last spclrk, And the last glassy glance must view Whicb freezes over its lifcless blue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Df which, in life o lock when shorn Affeotjon's fondest pledge was worn — But now is come away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then talking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, till thesc in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre oorse of the Arabian inajd Oneiza, who if represented cls having returned from the grave farthe purpose of tormenting him, she best lovedwhilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefart gives a long account ln his travels 0s several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have beeri on eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a va riety of anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as harbaricln error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices ori this singularly horrible superstiliori might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Varnpyre is the once in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations ottendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracled his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and tbrow fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of awe, could not explain whence it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance topierco through lo theinward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that woigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustamed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennuj, wore pleased at hearing something ln their presence capable of engaging their attenlion. In spite of the deady hue of bis face, which never galneda warmer tint, either from the hlush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, lhugh ils forin and outllnee were beautiful, many of the female hunlers after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of wbat tybhliee :— though in vain :— whon fhe stood before him, though bis eyes were apparently fixed upon her, But though the common adults could not infuenco even the guidanoc of his eyes, it was not that that femole sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which be spoke to the virtuous wife and lnnocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, bo was cls often among those females who form the boast of their sox from their domestic virtues, as among those who sell it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of gr eat wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought in their duty merely to take care of his forlune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenory subalterns, he could tivate more his imagination than his judginent. He held, hence, that high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which daily ruins so many milleners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathife with virtue, and lhought lhal vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the soene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted of the vosting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patohes. He thought, in the firie, that the dreams of the poet were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering irito, goy circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should defcribe with leasl truth, lheir languishing or romping favovrites: the daughters at the same time, by lheir brightening countenances wheri he approaehed, and by their sparkling eyef, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attacbed ashe was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at firiding, that, except in the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of fnuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing picture res and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensation in his grcltified vanity, he was about to rolinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fow other signs of his observation of oxternal objects, than the tac it assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon f ordered this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspriving of his fancy, rather than the person before hiin. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of prepara-\nThe town is — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some insormation respecting this singular character, who, till now, hcld only whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians, lhat it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enablo theyoung to toke some rapid steps in the caroor of vice towards pvtting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and riol following them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous entries are mentioned as t They consenled: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, who was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join a bim. Flattercd by such a mark of esteem from hlm, who, apparently, held nothing in a cartoon with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherta, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Jrig Lord Ruthveri's character, and now he found that, though inariy more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different cariclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality ;— the ldle, the vclgabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indlgen ce by the misfortunes attendant euen upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—lhese were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lvst, or lo sink him slill deeper in his This was, however, attributed by him to the greator importunity of this vicious, which generally preuclils over the retiring bashfulnefs of the virus indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those support whom will be bestowed, inevitablyfound that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the mast. about the next diary. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubroy was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his compclniori sought for the centrcs of all fashlonable vico; there he entered into all the splrit of the fara table: he betted, and alwayf gamhled with success, except wherethe known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was alwclys with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched In evory town, he left the formerlyaffluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursirig, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many fathers sat frantic, ainidst the speaking Iooks of mute hungry childrenreri, without a singlo farthing of his late immcnse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; bul immediately lost, lo the ruiner of mariy, the last gilder he had just snatehed from the convuls ive grasp of the inriocent: this night. but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Auhrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity arid pleosure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sconos of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiofity, he obtained no greater gratitude from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his oxalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his company; he left him in doing attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the bolief. His gvardians insisted upon himself lcaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession as irresistible powers of the decision, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress child not originated in hatrod of her character; but that he had required to enhance his gratisicatiori, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, shuld bc hurled srom lhepinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradalion: in fine, that all those females whom he had sou ght, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his\nAubrey deteriorated upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a clear singlo bright point ori which to rest the eye. He resolved to lnuent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more classly, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he briefly frequented. In Italy, it is a seldom that an vnmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end iri the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtlcss girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruplly asked him this intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must dec line accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of the call he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lardship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next dcly merely sent a bis servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; bvt did not hint any suspicion of bis plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rame, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traeing the faded records of aricierit glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deods of freomen only before slaves, a child hidden themselves beneath the shellering soul or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicale, thal sbe might have forrned the model for a pairiter washing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the father in Mahamet's pclradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mouritain side, one would have thought the gazolle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animatod nature, sor that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suitod but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in this search after aritiquities, and often would theunconscious girl, engaged in the pursvil of a Kashinere Buttersly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he bad just decyphered uponan almost effaced tablet, in the contemplotion of ber sylphlke police. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the freedom of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Paufariias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innoeence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circle.\nling dance upori to open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful mcmory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing iri her infancy; and then, turning to subjeots that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would lell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earriestness and apparent belief of what she narroted, excited the inlerest even af Aubrey; and osten as she told him the tole of the living vampyr e, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest lies, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for lhe ensuing montbs, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idlc and horrible fantasies; but Ic She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monfters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though clt the same time he wondered at these many coincidenoes which held all tended to excite o belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Ruthvcn.\nAubrey began to attaeh himself more and more to Ianlhe; her innoccnce, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost falry form before him. He would toar himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his altention upon the river around him, whilst in his mind he relained an image that secmed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Iari was unconseious of his love, and was ever the same frank irifantile being he had first known. She always seemed to parl from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, palc with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon the orie of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, os he inust necessary pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the rosort of the vampires in their nocturnal origins, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to lclug them out of the idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excurslon unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnesly begged of him to return, ere might allow the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not pe receive thal day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, ln the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and paur all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is olmost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he hod advanced far, the power of the storm walls above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain farced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the terrible forest. Theanimal al last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the circle of lightniring, thal he walked in the neighbourhood of a bouel thal hardly lifted himself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, tho thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, constant mackery of a laugh, concentrated on one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his hoad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found herself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was the takeri of him. He found himself iri contact with samo one, whom he immediately feized; when a voice ordered ,\"Again haffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he would, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was left from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands. upon his throat — when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the light of their lorches fell upon the mud wall, andhe thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes or soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted birn to her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, where the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his sarr conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was built a mission arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upori ber oheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelled there :— upper her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the inner pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horrar ,\" A Vainpy-\nrc! Vampyre !\" A litter was quickly farmed, and Aubreywas laid by the side of her who had already been to him the treatment of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seoined to shun reflection, and take refugo in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in this hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Theirlamentable series, as they approached the city, forewamod, the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to the course. They were inoonsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare time being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictioris upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, danced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whalever motiue, upon hearing of the fate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constarit attendant. When the lotter recovered from his delivery, he was horrified and startlod at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by bis klnd words, implying almost repentance for the fault that hod cavsed their separatian, and still inore by the attention, clnxiety, and care which he showed, soon rec onciled him to his presence. His Iordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic belng who had so astonifhed Aubrey; but os saon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceiued rio difserence from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gazc sixed intently upon him, with a symbol of malicious exultotion playing upon his lips: During the last stage of the irivalid recovery, Lord Ruthvonwas apparently engaged in watching the tid eless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which could once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rutbuen; but much as he wished for salitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Alhens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wondering amidst the underwood, in quest of the rnodest toilet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to bis wjld jmagination, her pale face arid wounded thro at, with a more smile upon her lips. He determined to play scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bourid by the tender care he had taken of hirn during his illness, that they should visit those parls of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a collection could be attached: but though they thus hclsteried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence, if thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a fow guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upori entering, howover, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for forcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their beads, and by the ec hoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behlrid rocks, had been to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retircd for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bode them advanee, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and lake them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forword in the sea of the enemy. Hardly, had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; ond, rio longer heeding the contents of his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately tbrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabiri; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presonce—they were not merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he held an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the inortisication ensued, and death seemed to be advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance bad riot changed; he sceined as unconsclous of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind he became apparently uneasy, orid his eye often fixed upori Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earneslriess —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; bul you may save my honor, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .,\"I need bvt a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stairiin the world's mouth — and if iny death were unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swcar !\" cried lhe dying man, raising himself with exutant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear lhat, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living ln any way, whatever may bappen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— Hiseyes seemed bursting from their socks :\"I fwear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his death, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the present of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been enviously by bimseif and comrades, upan his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given this lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the carpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, a hif mlnd was bewildered in the ejectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they badly buried the oo purse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently oonspired to heighten that fuperstitious melancholy that had seemed upon his mind, he realized to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects, he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the saine style as the daggor discavered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hasteriing to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed to be gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the hoft and she eath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood ori each.\nHe loft Sm yrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquirief were concerning the lady which had an example of snalch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rained, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken vrider, so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the doctor of Iantho. He became morose and silent; and his only occupalion consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if we were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hjm to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his sathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces arid caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, she had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a coinpanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was a riorie of that lightbrillancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. Her blue eye was never lit up by the level of the mind beneath. There was a molancholy charm about it which did not seem toarife from misfortune, but from some feeling, that appeared to iridicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butter fly or a colour may attract — just was sedate and penfive. When alone, her face will never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her prefericc forget those griefs she kriew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuclry? It seemed as if those eyes — thethal face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was twenty eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It has been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy stone\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the meancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fa shionoble strangcrs, when his mind had been to torn by the even bad witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smell of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, a little distonce, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to boar their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He placed the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, lf he were afraid his thoughts were barrowing from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought this imagination had conjured up the image his mind wasresting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insorination. He went a sew night after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the proteclion of a matron, he retired into a process, and there gave himself up to his own driving thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that rnany were leaving, he rovsed himself, clrid entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in the oomest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when orie, whom he roquested to move, turned round, and reveclled to him lhofofeatures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifter arm, and, with hurried stcp, forced hor towards the street: at the door he found bimself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and whilc he was engaged in possing them, he again heard that the police whisper close to him —\"Remember your ocltb !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister,soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by the orie object, how much more completely waf is engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was iri vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered four words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled bim ;—was he able to allow this morister to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, almost all he held dear, and not averl its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if both were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only two of his sister names, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At least, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitu de, he left his house, roamed from the street that ftreet, consciousness to fly that image which hourited him. His dress became neglected, and which wandered, class often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he said him down to rest where the fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow them; but they were soon distanced by a bim who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abfence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfclous, he determined to counter again irito society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of hif oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intirnacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks woro so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for beer sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wben, howover, reinonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allonated, they thought it high time to res urne again that trust which had been before introducing upori thein by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of sclving hlm from their injuries and sufferings he had daily concentrated on his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what thoyconsidcred folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take the constant core of bim. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His iricoherence became at last so great, that he was confused by his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaclated, his eyes had atlairied a glassy luflre ;— the only sign of affection and recycling remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes starl, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her riot totouch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True !\" and again he sank into a state, when she not even could rouse him. This last many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, which hisguardians observed, that several miles iri the day which would count upon his fingers a desinite number, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsod, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his gvardiaris entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when bis sisler was going to get married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the interest, of which they feared he had been deprived, they meritioned the name of the world of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aurey seemed pleased, and clstonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered only, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being offected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more olive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with allhis wanted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon hearing him why he thus destroyed the resembla-\nce or future husband, he looked as he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gclzing on her with a frantic expression of eounteriance, he made her swear that she would never wed this monsler, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice. e: again. badehim remember his oath — he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardian arid physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this wasbut a return of his disorder, enlcred, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to dolay bul for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Avbreys ill health, he reodily understood himself to be the causo of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those ainong whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant altendanco, and the pretence of great affection sar the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to recount—could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;—covld tcll bow, since he knew her, his existence, had beguri that seemed to be worried about presorvation, if it was inerely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will The tille of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening themarriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAuhrey, when he was left by the physician, arid bis guardians, attempted to bribe those servants, but iri vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a sew hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy cursos. The seruants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, who thought it would better not to harass the military more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, who he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at lastovercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, lecling hiin in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and ln a inoment found himself in the apartment where all we normally assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, arid, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthvenwhispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a bottle, had brokering a blood-vessel, and he was never ready to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not perfect when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, the bride and brideroom lost London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardlans might be called, and where the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly when the reader helps perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MIT-\nct: YLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\nct :\"The world was all before the bim, where to ease his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, on board one of his Majostys vesself, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The boauly of this place, and the certain supply of oattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchclritmen; arid though il lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply pay for the deviation of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the boy, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargoining for cattle with the natives, the clergy-\nman arid myself took a rambleto cave called Homers School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small moriticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English Iord, who left the island sour days preuious to our a river iri bif felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He is an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he bas left an old man in charge of it: he gave Domiriick, the wine-trader, six hundred zoohinef for il ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resigned there about sourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucoa very often to two different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—on the entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated ated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to plcly through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small branch Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane choirs and an empty book-case: there wore no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuff-\nfed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room with observod a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large seamaris chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boleaus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in GermanIanguage; Klopstock's Mc ssiah; Kotzebues nouels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Coristantinople, much to Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, a letter with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old mari said :\"The lord bad been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with those others; bvt,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until he retum; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frawn upor me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have the prove of this farmfor the trouble of taking care of it, except twentyzecbincs which I pay to an aged Armonian who resides in a small bottle in the wood, and wbom the Lord brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nct: The appearance of the house actually was pleasing. This portico in front was fifty paces long and fourleen 6 road, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work connections ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-lops are thus furnished, if upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble soat with an ornamental woodenback was plclced, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said that an old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always contacted our church twice a week, be sides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a birdeye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the body to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the fummit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small streom issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sca srnooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little from the left, through a uista of lofty chcsnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, sludding thelight blue wave with spots of emorald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirjes were fruitless as to the riame of the person who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Domiriick, his banker, who bad gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will only ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" sclid I —\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had porlioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, arid ever dissolved with them at the nuplial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and a cotton arid silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new host for a fisherman who had lost his award in a gale, and he often gave the Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have become a very clever and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at this cottage thought the proper riot to discloso. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord will often see walking on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught him himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we separated from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who a rambler in Greece could be. He had bad money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of dispositation, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fcllling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, cl pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The jridividual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in iny travels on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visited him at Mityleno .\" We had never heard of his lordshlps faine, as we had been some years from home; but \"C helped Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recogriized the recluse of Calcla in overypage. Deeply did we regret not having become more curious in our research at the stage, but we oonsoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me, that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uniriteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. Ho has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in one way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the request, as may be plainly gathered from these little aneetes. All the foreign feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted iri his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his boss. Tenderness, sympathy, arid charily appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reasari to inclrking him as a being on whose hoart religion hath set her sea, and over whose head Bencvolence hoth thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do a necessity right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and who dares jvstify himself before that awful tribunal where all must clear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in the secret, and the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "17": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until oster the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its precserit form since the divisjon of Latin and Greek churches; at which tirne, the idea of becoming prevalcnt, that a Lat in body could not corrupt if buried in lheir territory, lt gradually increased, and sormed the extent of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all our Hungary, Polan d, Auslrio, and Lorrajne, where tbc belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaoiated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattencd—and their ueins became distendod to such a state of repletion, as to cause\nIn the Londori Journal, of March ,1732, is a curiovs, arid, of course, a crediblo account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon ari examination of the cornmonder-iri-chlef and magistrates of the place, they positively and vnariimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nained Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre This proposition, however, did not prevent bim from hecoming a vampyre himself; for, about twonty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and the cl­pristiori was mado, that four persans had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entiroly free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the customized remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is ropo-\ntried to have cried well as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations that any other institute which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece. it is considered as a sort of punishment after dealh, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A fupposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall srom its tomb be rent; Tben ghastly havnt the native place, And suck lhe bload of all thy race; There from thy daugbter, sist er, wife, At midnight drain lhe stream of life; Yet loothe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yel expir But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That ward sball wrap by heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glancc must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Thcn with unhallowed hand shall tear Tbe tressef of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Meinorial of thine agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullcn grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thcso in horror shrink away from spectre more occurred than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Tbalaba\", the vampire corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst inoxislence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and inriocence. This veraciaus Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anocdotes, and traditionary riarrotives jllustratives of its effects, has pvt forth some learned dissertctions, ten-\nding to prove it to be classical, as well as barbarian orror.\nMany curious and interesting notiees on this singularly horrible superstition rnight be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a notc, necessarily devated to oxplanation, and which may now be bc concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for the singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as he could not participate there. Apparently, the light lengther of the four only attracted his attention, that he might by a loak qucll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those wbo folt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not sccm to penctrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward workings of the beart; bvt fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that wejghed upon the skiri it would not pass. His peculiarities caused bim to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mariy of the femalo hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some rnorks of what they might term affectjon: LadyMercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since ber marriage, threw herself in his way, and did o But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his oyes, it was not that the femole sex was iridifforent to hiin: yet such was the apparent caulion which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were involved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAboul the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he wos an orphan lest with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relquished the more important charge of his mind than the care of the rencenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, because, that high romantic feeling of honour and oaridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virlue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesquo effect of the scerie, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted of the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye, their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rieb: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should escribe with Ieast through their languishing or romping favourites: tho daugbters at the same lime, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led bim into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his social hours, he started finding that, except in the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was a foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and deseriptions oontained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensatian in his gratified vanity, he was about to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in this career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari the tacit afsent to their existence, jmplied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imagination to pictureevery thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forined this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offfpring of his fancy, rather than the person before him He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his preseriee was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soari found, from the notes of preparation long — Street, shall he be about totravel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this sirigular character, who, till now, bad only when ettod his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable them to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upori an equality with the aged, and notallowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous iritrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioriing his intentions to Lord Rulhuen, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from hjm, who, apparently, held nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthvenscharacter, and now he found that, though many rnore of his actions were exposed to this view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to this conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his handmore than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, roduced to indigence by the misfortunes atteridant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were fent from lhc daor with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relievo his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was an orie circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still rnore impressed upon his mind: call those upon what will be bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, far they wore all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most object industry. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey waf surprized at the apparent cagerness with which his companion sought for tho centres of all fashionoble vice; there he he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known shclrper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but jt was always with the sarne unchanging face, with which the faro lable: he betted, and always gambled with success, In every town, he left the f more affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursing, in theitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gombling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the lastgilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the inriocent: this might but bc the result of acertain degree of knowledge, which wclf riot, however, capable of combating the cnlng of the lhe more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and bcg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to lose his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each doy he boped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to bim; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in bis carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtalned no greater gratitude from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of fomothing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, aridubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning eircle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost doserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impassion; tbe fi rst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; tbe others were from his guardiaris, tbe latter astanished him; if it had before entered into bis imagination that there was an evil power resident in his composition, these seemed to give bim suffieient reason for the belief. His guardians irisisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, arid urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible power of seduction, rendered his licenlious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that hif contempt for the adultress had not originated in batred of her character; but that he had required, to enbanoe hif gratification, that his victim, the partner of hls guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sine, that all those semales whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since bis departure, throwri even the mask as\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a slrigle right point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to level no slight circumstances passed by unnoticed. He entered the sarne circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he highly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimclrried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secrel; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an afsignation had been oppointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of cln innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him histions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being able to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he would be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avbrey retlred; and, immediately wriling a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accomponying hif Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordored bis fervant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the inother of the lcldy, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation will be prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete appeal to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Harry directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; a cold foon oecupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon manuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemeri only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as bimself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtrcly on canvass the promised hope of the failhful in Mahomets paradisc, save that her eyes spoke too much mind forany one to think she could belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced upon the plane, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beouties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the clnimal suitcd but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acooinpanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconseious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, wbo forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flittod around, exhibit in the sun ray sueh delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetsulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object to had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passoge in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was inriocence, yauth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for this future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencjl, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would painful, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the sup ernatural Her earnestness and apparent beliefaf what she narrated, excited lhe inlerest euen of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyro, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest tief, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of the siends appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to beljeve her, for just had been, romarked, that those who had dared to question Such detailed to him the traditional appear-\nthe ance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernaturalpower of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to atlach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young inanof English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at timesfram her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found just impossible to find his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained a clean image that seemod alone to be the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she hod rio longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragmorit which hod yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyref, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, called with a borror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, or he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, afler that dcly had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgios, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon the hlm who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them fhudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe the thomelancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, bad inspired them with such a terrar. When he was about to depart, Ionthe carne to the side of his horse, andearnestly begged to him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— which promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that iri the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— Hc at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, ln these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sels, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing lhunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rairi forced its way through the canopying foli ogc, whilst the blue forkcd lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his eyes. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glareof lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted himself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to give him to the town, or at least trying to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stuffed, exultant mockery of a laug h, continued in an almost unbroken sound ;—ho was slartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rollod over his head, he, with a sudden efforl, forced open the door 0s the hut. He found himself in bitter darkness: sound, bowever, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he ealled, still found continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone who he immediately said; when a voice cried ,\" Agclin bafflod !\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell bis life as dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was ln voin: he was lifted from his feet clnd hurled with enormous force againsl the graund :—his enomy threw himself upon him, ond knecling vpon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many tor The storm was still now; and Aubrey, the infrastructure of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of theirtorches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soal. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her crimes; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchef once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that just was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, strehed by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even vpon her lip; yet tberc was stillness about her face that seemed almo st as attccbing as tho life that orice dwelt there :—upon her neck and brcast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teoth hauing opened the vein :— to this teoth men pointed, crying, simultaneoufy slruck with horror ,\" Avaampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who badly lently been to him the object of so many hright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to sbun reflection, and lake refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of others whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewamed the parents of some dreodful catastrophe. — To describe their gries would be impossible; but when they oscertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, the arid point ed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable coinbination he seemed to beg of his former companion to sparo being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord R uthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatover motive, upori hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became bjs constont attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image ho had now combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Rulhven, by his kind words, implying almofl repentance for the fault thal hadcaused their separation, and still more by the attention, onxiety, and care which he showed, foon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; butas faon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the Iast stage of the invail recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless eclipses raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, appeared to wish to avoid the oyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, is much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so dislingujshod him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wishes for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the mod est vjolet; then suddenly turning raund, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. How determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bourid by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Greece either hadyet seen. They trovelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a collection could beattached: but though they thus hadteried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robberf, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it would to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preten ded dangers. In consequence of thus collecting the choice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent their nogligence; for scarcely were the whole of the parly engaged in the narrow pass, when they were slartled by the whjstling of bullets close to their heods, and by thoecboed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of heing thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade thern advance, and being expased to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to revise the eryery. Hardly had they left the sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastenod to bis assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards have g, upon Lord Ruthveri being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Auhrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon or ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two dclys mortlfication issues, and death seemed advancing with hasy steps. His conduct and appearance had not ehanged; he seemed as uneonscious of painas he had been on the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently unoafy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was indvced to for his assistance with more than usual eamestness —\"Assist ine! you may save me — you may do more than thal — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my hono-\nyour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I necd but little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if a yov would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I — but life. \"—\" It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you maysee. ct :\"— All eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAvbrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances cltending his acquaintance with this mori rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rjsing early iri lhe morning, he was about to onter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met hiin, and informed him that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself arid comrodes, upon retiring, to the pinnocle of a reighbouring mount, according to a proinise they had given his lordship, that il should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of the men, decided to go and bury it upon the spotwhere just lay. But, when he had rnounted to the summit, he found no troce of eitber the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the jdentical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in corijectures, but he at last recovered, convinced that they had buried the purpose for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently corispired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had sold upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less decided to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and attractions. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forins, whot was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weap on, and his horror rnay imagined when he discovered thal it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; hul the particular form, the same varying tinls upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were cancerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens deductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey Mirid became almost broken under so inariy ropeated horrorf; he was afraid that this lady had called a victim to the deftroyer of Ianthe. He became morase and filent; and his only occupation could besisted in urging the speed of the postilions, if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him at the English shores; and he haslened to the mansion as his fathers, and the o, for a mament, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If sbe besore, by her infantine caresses, had a goiried his offection, now that the woman began to appear, sbe was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and appearance of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never built up by the levity of the mind breath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which stroys where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alarie, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her big affection, and would in her presence forget the whole gri feet. she knew he destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluntary? It seemed as if those eyes — that fate were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It has been thought by the ber guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the content, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Au charity would rather have remained in the inansjon of his fathers, and fed a phone to be inelancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protector of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — the drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened the third. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of clll around him, engoged in the remembrance that the first friend he had seen Lord Ruthvon was in that very plaoe —he selt bimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly oourage to turn, fearful of seeing clst a speotre that would blast him, when he perceiving, at a liltle distanco, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcling a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced this room with hurried steps, and fixed hisharids upon his head, if he were afraid his thoughts were burstling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumftances started up in a drecldful array—the dagger—his oath .— He rousod himself, he could not believe it possible—the decld rise again !— He thaught his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It is impossible that it could be real—he determined, theresore, to ga agoln into society; for though he was tempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung up on his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a marathon, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, feized his sifter arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himsels impeded by thecrowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that v voice whisper closc to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached horne.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now needed, and it was in vain that she told him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slartled him ;— was then to allow this morister to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, arid not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by the thing. But even if he were to break his oath, and disolose his spirits, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a watch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shook up in his room, he saw no one, and he was only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support the picture. At last, no longeroapable of bearing slillness and solitudo, he left his house, roamed from street to street, consciousness to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became negleoted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day suri as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at least he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forcwarn, in spite of this oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at the end obligated to beg of him to abstain from sccking, for her sake, a society which aff-\nected him so strongly. When, however, remonslrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to lriterpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume a gain that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to refide in the house, and take constarit care of him. Ho hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became to the last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, the ineapable of being roused. Hc had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollectlon remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severe lyafflicted her, who would deslre her not to touch her. \"Ob, do not touch him — if your love for me is a club, do not go a regular bim !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True !\" and again he sank into a state, whenco not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as this year was passing, his iricoherences became less frequent, and his mind thrcw aff a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of the busy guardians entering his room, began to converse with his p hysioian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Harry's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glod of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they meritioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them full more by hisexpressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered that, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. Hc was apparently agoin capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being ance more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly received a lock upon her breasl; opening il, what was a bis surprise at boholding the features of the monster who had so lang influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, be looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantie expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would rever wed thif monstcr, for he — But be cauld not cldvance—it scemed as is thot voioe again bade him rememor his oath In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who should hear the whole, and thought this was about a return of his disorder, entered, and for-\ncing him from Miss Aubrey, defired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he improved, he hegged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavored to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been resused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemod inside, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, one, by constant attendanoe, and the lack of affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. What could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tollf to recount—could speak af himself as an individual having rio syinpathy with any bcing on the crowded earth, save with hor to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the servants art, or such was lhe will of fate The title of the elder branch falling at length to hjm, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bring these servants, but in vajn. Ho asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heclvy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the raving of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy irimates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants could last overcame their vigilanoe, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment he sounded himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hern: he immediately approached, and,taking his arm by force, hurri held him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Rutbven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Womori is frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendees, who, r, oused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his role not finding vent, had broken blood-vefsel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agiating her. The marriage was sophisticated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreyness weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death.

Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the third of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LONE BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, an board one of his Majesly vessels, in the year 1821, we pull into the harbor of Mitylenc, on the island of that name. The beauties of this place, and the certainly supply of cattlo and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—bolh men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; af usval, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in w aftering, and the purchase bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman arid myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucoa. \"He arranged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely. to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, bclongf to bim, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechiries sor it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the different islarids .\"\nThis account excited our euriasity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who conducted us over the tension. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drowing-room, a sitting parlaur, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were allsimply decorated: pl ain groen-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by revising a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a doz, eri English cane chairs, and an empty blackcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single pointing. The bedchamber had more large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble reeess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers which were then in a large soaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did riot thirik ourselves justified in explaining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Ro ufseau works complete; Volney's Rvinsof Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Parma in I 810; several small pamphlets from the Grcek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books that evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frowri upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a fervice; and I had the procedure of laking care of it, except twenty zecbines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small oo bottle in the wood, and whom lhe lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was really pleasing. The portico in front was fisty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marblc pillars with black pliriths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now eustomary iri Grocian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnishing, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryrna Christ i,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet glided away, g rapes, oranges and limef were cluftering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrlle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamerital wooden back was placed, an which we were told, the lord passed mony of his evenings arid n lights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very difficult ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to MontCalcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and ori the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small streomissing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the world near the mau-\nthe train base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrninates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a just of 1ofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small iflands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had a gondo Ca India. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure we will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the lown we learnt several particulars of theisolated lord. He had protected eight young girls when which was lasl upon the island, and even danced with them at the national festival. He gave a bow to one man, b flowers to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishermari who had lost his own iri, a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been very eccentric and beneficial characters. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage taught proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whomrn the lord, was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the music of it.\nSvch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greeoe could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, arid all those eocentricities which mark a peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dealt. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been trovelling in Egypt andGreoce ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byran; I rent a bim on money travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of this lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calca on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottag c, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future daily; but to mo lhat day will receive return. I make this statement, believing it is quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships goad name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to ossociating with human nature, or contributing in a very way to further sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly to the reverse, as may be plairily gathered from these little anecdoles. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly dep icted in his lordships pooms, came to have their seat in this bosom. Tenderries, sympatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a being on whose beart religion hath set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lrails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against moral integrity; and he who dares justisy himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may ensure the errors of a follow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of hisgenius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, just the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving canscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cart, Fleet-street.",
    "18": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition concept which this tale is founded is very general in the class. Among the Arabians, it appears lobe common: it did not, however, exterid itself to the Grecks until after the establishment of Cbristianity; and it has only assumed its present form finance the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if burjod in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungory, Polarid, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a cert-\nalong a portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of eorisumplions; whilst these human blood-svckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to causo the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodics, and evori from the very power of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular oase of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-ohief and rna gistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, e. a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pavl, had beeri heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vainpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the eorth This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by a hirn, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the infections having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisan) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accomplished remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, thoy cut off his head, broken his body, and lhrow the ashes into his grave. The scale measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, the least they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person suckod by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nct: Chief half.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other inftanee which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aster death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but coinpelled to confine his infernal visitations solely that those beings he loved mosl while upon earth — those to whom he was bourid by ties of kindred and affoction .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse half from its lomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midriighl draln the stream of Iife; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Tby victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; But once the forthy crime must fall, the youngest, best beloued of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap by heart in slame! Yot thou musl end the task and mark Her cheoks last tinge—her eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must vlew which freezes other ils lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life o lock when shorn Affections fondost pledge was worn — But riow is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood fhall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard pi; Then stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre make accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced iri his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire corse of the Arabion maid Oneiza, who is represented as having recurried from the grave for the purpose of tormening him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tbe veraciaus Toumefort gives a long occount in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calrnet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional riarrativcs illustrative of its effects, he put forth some learned dissertations, tendling to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limils of a note, recessorily devoted to explanation, and which may now be conluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a Londori winter, there appeared at the various parljes of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his linguistics, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of this fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness rang. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributod it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin will not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see hiin, and those who bad beer clecustomed to victory excitement, and riow felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the de adly hue of his sace, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty,or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attompted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term afsection: Lady Mercer, who had been threw herself in his way, and did all but pvt on the dress of a mountainebank, to attract his notice :— though But though the comrnori adultress could not influence every guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that fact knew he had never addressed himself to failure. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of bis flrigular c character, or that they were moved by his parent hatrod of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their fex from theirdomestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, thore came to London, a young gentleman of the race of Aubrey: he was an orph an left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaternf, he cultiuated more his imogiriation than his judgment. He had, hence, that high ramontic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many million appliances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providencc merely for the picturesque effecl of the scene, as we see in Romancos: he thought that the misery and a cottage merely consisted in the ve sting of clothes, which were af warm, but which were better adaptod to the painter's eye by their irrogular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, fronk, and rich: for these reasons, preparing his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their languishing or rompiring favourites: tho daugbters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talenls and hjs me right. Attclched as he wos to the rornance of his folitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tcllow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffling, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congerics of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, the same composition in his gratisied vanjty, hc was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have abovo described,crossed him in this career.\nHe wcltched him; clrid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the c haracler of a mon entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the fact assent to their existence, imp-\nlied by the ovoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture overly hiding that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and delermiried to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveri asfairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of giving some information respecting this singular character, who, lil now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, which far many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn They consented: and Aubrey immediately mention his intentions to Lord Heaven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in iri common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was proposed in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beslowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink hjm still deccr in his iniquity, he will send away with rich This was, however, contributed to him to the greater importance of the voice.\nious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigont. There was one circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was felt more impressed uponhis mind: all those upon whom it was bestawed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brufsels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his company sought sortbe centres of al sashionable vice; there he entered inlo all the spirit of the faro table: be betted, and always garnbled with success, except where lhe known sharper was his antaganist, and lhen bc lost even more than he gclined; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which  il was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novico, or the luckless father of the tortious family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this appclrent abftractedness of mind wcls laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the sarmerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drowned him within the roach of this friendship mony a father sat fronlic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his lote immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of inany, lhe last gjlder he had just snatched from the convulfive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wisbed to represent this to his friend, arid beg him to rosign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did nottend to his own proflt ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and open only to him; hawever, this never occurred. Lord Ruth uen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes ofnature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and laugh Aubrey was near the object of hisouriosity, he obtained no greclter gratisication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of sarnething supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; be left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the rnemorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lettors arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breathing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astanished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power refident in his composition, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately Ieaving bis friend, and urgcd, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible power of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangorous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt sor the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he hodrequired, to enhance his gratification, that hls victim, the partner of his gvilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowost abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whoin he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside,\nAvbrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning a bim altogether, purposing, in the Korean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He eritered into the same circle, and soori perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperlence of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried fomale is met with in society; he will therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered thatan assignationori had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an inriocent, though thougtless girl. Lasing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, insorming hlm at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were sveh as he supposed all would have a poor such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended.\nct: needed to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a nate, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the rernainder of their proposed lour, he ordered his servant to seek otherapartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with the guard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was presented. Lord Ruthven right day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by the Avbreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and cross-\nLong Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He there sixcd his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied hiinself in traciring the fclded records of ancient glory upon monuinents that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deedf of freemen only before slaves, had bidden themselves between sheltering soil or many colored licheri. Under the same roof as himself, existed a heing, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise,savo that her eyes spoke too much mlnd for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plane, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrey in his search afler antiquities, arid ofton would the unconscious glrl, engclged in the pursuant of a Kashrnere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of ber form, floating as it was upon the wind, lo tbe eager gaze of him, who forgat the lettcrs he had just decyphcred upon an almost effaced problem, in the contemplation of Often would her lresses falling, or she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly sad hues, it might well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object which had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe the harms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innacence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whist he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hovrs, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenos of hor native place; she would then describe him the circling dclnce upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youtbful momory, the marriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a Hcr eamestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exclted the interest even of Aurey; and often as she told him the tale of the ljuing vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and devilest tief, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femcllo to prolong his exjslence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold,whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies She detailed to hear the traditional appearance of these monsters, orid his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty occurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth iri her fears, laugh at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which held all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural pawer of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey beg to attack himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocenoe, so contrasted with all the affeoled virtues of the women among whom he had saught sor his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridicvled the idea of a young man of English hobits, inarrying ari uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself moro and inore attaehed to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himselfclt times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiqvarianrefearch, he would depart, deterinined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix bisatlentlon upon the ruins around him, whilft in his mind he retained an imclge thal seemed alone the rightful posssor of his lhovgts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and wcls ever became frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to parl from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied with sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirming their existence, pale with horror at every name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was lo detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all clt once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neccssarily pass through a wood, where no Grcek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their noctumal orgies, and announced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade the light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at bis daring thvs to mock a svperior, external power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to observe the mclancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, bad inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earriestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in aotian ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendaus mass, and prove all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these soutbern cllmates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above o—its ecboing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves, arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismoving, he approached, hoping to find a one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtainshelter from the pelting of the starm. As he approached, the thunders, for cl mornent silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mlrigling with the stifled, exultclnt moekery of a laugh, conlinued in orie almost unbrokcn sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no police was taken of him. He found himself in contact with somc 0 ne, whom he immediately fcized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh sueceed; and he folt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: detormined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it waf in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurried with onormous force against the ground :—his enemy  The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Avbrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torcbes once more burst upon him, to perceive the early form of his fair conductress b rought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his subconscious imagination; but be again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan ber lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemod almost as attaching as the life that orice dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upori her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, slmultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! o compare !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of ber who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now follen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benvmbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he beld almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They weresoon met by different parties who had been engaged in this search of her woman mother had a kiss. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the elty, forewarned parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubroy, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; but they died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upori Ianthe—by some vnaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former eompanian to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate malcdictions upon his head, and forgive him as her doctor. Lord Ruthven, chanoed at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever inotiue, the upper hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his oonslant attendont. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and ftartled with the sight of him whose image he had riow comblned with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, ignoring almost repentance for the fault that had caused their soparation, and still more by the atterition, anxiety, and caro which he showed, soori reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic heing who had so astonlshed Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the foreign man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation plclying upon his lips: he knew not wby, but this smile haunted him. During the last stoge of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like over the world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the cyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a Iover af solitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; bvt mueh as he wlshed for solitude, his mind would not find it in the nelghbourhood os Atbens; if he sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly srequenled, Iclntbes formstood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would clppear wander He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rvthve n, to whom he held himself bound by the tendency care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet been. They travellod in every direction, and fought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually bogan to slight these reports, which they imagined were orily the invention of individuals, whose interest is to excile the generosity of those whom they defen-\nct: died from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglocting the advice of the jnbabitarits, ori one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow dcfile, ot the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock hrought down from neighbouring precipices, they hcld reclson to repenl their negligence; for scarcelywere the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startledhy to whistling of balls close to their hoads, and by thc echoed the report of several guris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed is being thus detained by a foe, who with insulling shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eryery. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a sbot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his awn peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being woundcd, immediately thrawn up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reword, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their eomrade should return with the lbe promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: hut towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honor, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any lhing ,\" replied Avbrey .—\"I need but little —iny Iife ebbs apace — I cannot complain about the wh ole — but if yov would coriceal all you know of me, my honovr was free from stain in the world's mouth — and lf my death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swcar !\" cried the dying man, raising him lf with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for cl year cl a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you must see. \"— His eyef seemed burstling from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed a more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did riot sleep; the many circumstances were attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold sbivering came over him, as if from the presentation of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he wos about to enter the hovcl in which he had left the corpse, wheri a robber inet hirn, and iriformed him that just was no longer there, having been conueyed by himsclf arid comcldes, upori retiring, to the pinnaccle of a neighbouring mount, accord-\ning to a promise, they had given a hls worship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounled to thesummit, he found no traco or either the corpse or the clothes, though the rubbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, the basic mind was bewildered in concrete rest, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the purpose for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he hadmet with such terrible misfortunos, clnd in which also apparently conspired to fight and that superstitlous melancholy that bad seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naples, he accepted himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at firiding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to go further proof, he found a weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, then sheath he held in his hond. His oyes seemed to need no further certainty—they secmed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet ftill he wished to disbolieve; but the peculiar form, the same varying lints upon thehaft arid sheath were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inqulries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arls. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been he heard of since the lack of departure of a lordship. Aubrey's mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose arid silent; and his only oecupation oonsisted on rushing the speed of thepostilions, as if he were going to savo the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon watched him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she was before, by her information, caresses had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room afsemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartinent. Her blue cycle was never lit up by the beauty of the mirid boneath. There was a melanc .-\nthe holy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not tall light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a color may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brlgged by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would iri her presence fargel, those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuclry? It seemed as if those eyes ,—thal space was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, arid had not been presented to the world. It had been thought by ber gvardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's relative from the eontinent, whon he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of a hard entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind had been so tom by the events which had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long line, and all who were anxious to back in the smile of royalty, a blstenedthither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a comer by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a volce he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had bardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a feature that would blast him, when he perceived, a little distance, the sarne figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almostrefusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, who threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were brsting from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could riot believe it possible-\n— the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image of his mind was resting upon. It was impassible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; so he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could riot succeed in gaining information. ct: He went a few nights after talking with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a malrori, he retired against a recess, and there gave himself up to his own de vauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he ottempled to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: clt the door he sound himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; arid while he was engaged in passing them. He again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurryling his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. Is before his mind being absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsler's living agoin pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in action that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starllod bim ;—wos he then to allow this morister to climb, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not overl its progress? This very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe them? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes streaming with tears, besides him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillnoss and slitted, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and which wandered, is often exposed to the noon-daysun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whatever faligue outtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disappointed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. This conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that be Ieftby his absencc the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oatb, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was also Iast obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeling, for her soke, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming encapsulated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that the target which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreyf parents.\nDesirous of saving hiin from the irijuries and sufferings he had daily eneountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those markf of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and lake constant care of him. He barely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorhed by one terrible subject. His incohercrice became lost last so great that he was confused by his comm-\nct: beer. There would often lie for days, because of being roused. He became a bad lustre, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and rccollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicled her, he would desire her nol to touch him. \" Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me is right, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he recovered, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank irito state, whence not even could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, which his guardiaris observanced that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then srilo.\nThe time bad nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, once of his guardians enlering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melanoholy circumstances of Aubreys being in so awful a siluation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly, Avbrey attention was attractive; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returriing intellect, of which they seared, he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsdon. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had rented with in society, Aubrey seomed pleas ed, and aftonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered the riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressod her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplisbinent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysin of the rage, and trampled it under foot. Upori hor asking him why he thusdestroyed the resemblance of her futurc husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —then seizing her hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expression of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would never wedthis monfter, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice clgain bade hiin remember his oath—he turned fuddenly round, thinking In the meantime, the guardians found physiciari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a result of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, hc implored, he begged them to delay, but sor one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined had taken possession of a high mind, and eavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called ed to be inorning after the drawing-ram, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exclusion arid pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Ho hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest like his fate, which gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tails ta recount— could speak of bimsels as of an individual having no sympathy with any bolng earlhsave with her to whom he addressed bimsels ;— could tell how, since he kriew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— in fino, be knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that  The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's derangedstate ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAbbrecy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attended to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked her upon and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that inarriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would be better not to barass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily beconceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, arid the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiousity of the servants at last overeame their vigilanco, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of their helpless old woman. He asked the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When ori tho staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in bis ear —\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his parents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; this rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he wasconveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his salesler, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effectiveness of blood produced symploms of the neclr approach of death. He desired his sisler guardians might be called, and where the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had a bad disappearance, and Aubrey sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was only before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archjpelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this pl acc, and the cortain supply of oattle and uegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmeri; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountios only repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small moriticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Groek of our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in bis felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, lbe wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 E English currency ), and has resided there about fourlcen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in listening to the house where our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansiori. It consisted of four compartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, a bedroom, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were allsimply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, marble tables on either side, a large meter in the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the brariches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poster; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the half stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedehamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — a cornmon bed through Greeco. In the lbe sitting-roorn we observed a marriage recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's closet in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaires,Shakspeare's, Boileous, arid Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Ziminerman, in the German lariguage; Klopstock Mesfiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; se verol small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"Tbe lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his retum; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without order, he would frown upon me for a week together; which is always very good. I once did hire a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeohines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a cold frnall eottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThis appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the flutod marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, berieath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are thus surnished, as upon them, the Greoks pass their ovenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, aranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shape of two large mystical bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placcd, on which we wore told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose\" said the old mari ,\"praying\" far he was very devout ,\" and always attended ourchurch twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be tormed \"a bird-eyc view\". A piece of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, clnd on the summil of which an ariclent Groek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smallstream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and cln horizon unshadowed by a singlo cloud, termiriates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnvt and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emorad green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solution: no one knows his name, Billy Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our coriductor ,\"would tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the Armonlan, but on our return to the town we learnt seven-\nreal particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the original feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a galc, and he often gave Greek Testamentf to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, also have been a very eccentric arid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought a hor a piano-forte, and taught her half the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the arohitect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco ,\"The individual,\" faid he ,\" about whoin you are so anxious, Js Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never ever heard of his lordship fame, as we had beeri somc ycars from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pulled into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc ori some software day; but to me that day will never return.

He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add lost pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the beart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in the hif bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charily approach to guide all his actions: and his courting the reposc of solitude is on an additional reason for marking a bim as a beingon whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whofe head Bonevolence hath tbrown her rnantle.

    "19": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Poidori.\nTHE superslition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. the Arabians it appears to be commori: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed just a prefect form since the decision of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon theblood of the yaung and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and L0rraine, where the belief cxisted, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portlon of the blood of thoir uictims, who become emaciated, I0st their strength, and speedily died of consumptlons; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their vejns becamedistend to sucb a structure of reple\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible accuracy of a particular case of vampyrism, which is started to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commonder-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a cortairi Hcyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hoard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating sorne of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and This precaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming an avampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and hurial, many people complained of having beentormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been depressed on life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be useful in cases of varnpyrisrn) frosh, and entirely free from corruption, arid emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreodfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into a high grave. The same measures were adopted with the correct those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a clumber becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monslrous rodomoritade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the object of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punjshment after death, sor some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine bls irifernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A suppositiori alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the earth, of Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood os all thy circle; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loathe lhe banquet which perforce Must foed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere tbey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their si re; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, The flowers are withdrawn on the stem. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best believe in all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in the lame! Yel thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's lclst tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glclnce must view which sreezes over its lifeless blue; Theri with unhallowed hand shall toar The tresses of her yellow hclr, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing looth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy svllen grave, Go—and with Gaulf and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Suthey hcls also introduced in bis wild but beautiful point of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre course of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. she best loved whilst in existence. But this caririot body supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourncfort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work upon this subject, besidos a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrativefillustrative of itseffects, has put forth some learned dissertatioris, tending to prove it to be a classi cal, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious arid iriteresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present rnay suffice for the Iimits of a note, recessarily devoted to explonation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre, if the one in most goneral acceptance, there are several others syrionymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt bappened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the thoton, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the milk around him, as if we could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look at it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upan the object face, did not seem to penctrote, and clt one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. Hif participants caused him to be invited to every house; all wishes to see him, and those who had been accused of violent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warrner tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passion, lhomackery of every morister shewn iri drawing-rooms since her mar riclge, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to ottract his notice :— though in vajn :— when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her But though the common adultress could not influence the evon the guldance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yel such was the apparent action with which he spoke to the virtvous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew to be ever addressed to females. He had, bowcver, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his sjngular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who scx from their domestio culture, as among those who svlly it by their vicos.\nAbout this time, there came to Londori, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan lest with an only sister in the possession of great well-\nth, by parents who died while they were still in childhood. Lest also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to lake care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important chargo of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that huge romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many rollers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was lhrown ln by Providorice merely for the picturesque effeot of the scene, as we seein romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting ofclothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painful eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of pets were the realities of life. He was bclndsome, frank, and rich: for tbesercasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with real truth, their languishing or romping favouritef: the daughters at the same time, by their brighlening cauntenances whenhe approached, and by their brighlening cauntenances whenhe approached, and by their brighlening cauntenances when he approached, and by their brighlening Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started finding that, except in the tallow and wax caridles that flickered, nat from the presence of a ghost, bul from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasling pictures and descriptions contained inthose volumes, from which he had formed hif study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched bim; and the very impossibility of forming ari idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gauges the other signs of his obscrational extemalobjects, than the tacit assentto their existence, implied by the avoidance of their conlact: allowing his linclgination to picture everything that flcttered its propensity to exextrovagant ideas, he soan formed this objeot irito the hero of a He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthuen affairs were embarrasfed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was able to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted hls curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for bim to perform the tour, which for many gerierations has been thoughl neossary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vioe towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falen from the skies, whenever s candalous intrigues arc mentioned They consented: and Aubrey immediately meritioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fl atterod by such a mark of the system from him, wbo, apparently, bad nothing in common with other meri, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nNeither, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthv-\nen character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, to vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediato wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remorking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigenco by the misfortuncs attendont even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were scnt from the door with hardly suppressod sneers; bul when the profligate came to ask something, nol torelieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in hif lust, or to sink him slill deeper in his irii This was, however, attributed by him to the greclter important of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retriring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstonce about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all lhase upon whom it was bestowed, lnevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all neither led to this scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other townsthrough which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he betted, arid always gained success, except where the known sharper wcls his antagonist, and thenhe lost euen more than he gained; but il was clways with the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fatber of a numeraus family; then hif very wish seemedfortvnedness of mind was laid aside, and In the overy town, he left the formerly affluent youth, tom from the oircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him with the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farth of his late mind, wherewith to buy even susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder bo had just snatcbed from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which waf riot, however, capable of combating the cunning of the rnore ex perienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hopod his friend would give him some opportunity to speak French and only to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was ncar the object of his curiosity, be obtairied no grealer gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wisbing to break that inystery, which to bis exalled imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left bim in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was having engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his fister, breathing nothing but affection; that others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before eritered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insifted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged him that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduetion, rendered hif licenlious habits more dangerous to society. Il had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he bad required, to change his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt,should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vlrtue, down to lhe lowost abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on occount of their value, had, since his departure, thrown \nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hiin altogether, purpasing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that the Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an urimarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubricky eye followed him in call his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been applied, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meel her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed.\nsed all would have upon such an oocasiori; and upon being prefsed whether he intended to rnarry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant toseek other paper tments, and calling ng upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven Riexl day merely sent his seruant to notify his complele assent loa separation; bul did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been followed by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Penjnsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori occupjed himself in tracing the faded reeords of ancierit glory upon moriuments that apparently, asharned of chr onicling the deeds of freemon only before slaves, had hidden thernselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of befaithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spake too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountainside, one would have thought the gazele a poor type of her beautios; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye or animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal svited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompani ed Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wauld the unconscious girl, engagod in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the constiplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she felt around, exhibit in the sun ray such deljcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanjas. But why attempt to describe charms which all seem, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youlh, and beavty, affected by crowded drawing-rooms aridstifling balls. Whilst he drew the remajns of which he wished to preserve a memorjal for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effecls of his pencjl, in tracing the socnes of her native place; she would then describe him the circle dancing upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful inemory, the rnarriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infoncy; and then, turning to subjects that bad evidently mado  Hcr earnestness and apparent beljef of what she narrated, exoited the interest even of Aubrey; and often af she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had pclssed years amidsl his friends, and dcarost ties, forced every year, by foeding upon the life of a lavely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whil sl he attempted to lough her out of such idle She detailed him to the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still presisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in ber fears, though at the same timehe wondered at these many coinoidences which had already tended to exoile o belief in the svpematural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach hirnself rnore and more to Ianthe; her jnoeence, so cont rasled with all the asfected virtues of the women omong whom he had soughl for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an unedvcated Greek girl, still he found bimself more and more attached to them almost fairy form before him. He would lear himself at times from her, and, sorming a plari for somo antiquarian research, he would depart, determined riot to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that fcemed alone to be the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uncanscious of his love, and waf ever the same frank infanlile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer clny one with whom she could vifit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelching or uncovering some frogment which had yel efcaped the deftative hand of time. She had appealed to her parents from the subject of Vampyros, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, peace with horror at the very name. Saon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detainhim for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any considerati-\n on .. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impcending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his conclusion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncholy face of this host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retum, there might allow the power of these beings to be put inaction ;— he promised. He was, howcver, so occupiod in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that iri tho horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upori the devoted country .— He at least, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climate, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sels, night begins: and there he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forecasts way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to sall and radiale at his very feet. Suddenly, this horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful clpidity through the entangled forest. The animal at laft, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the circle of lightning, that he was in the theneighbourhood of a havel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded him. smounting, he approached, boping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the droadful shrioks of a woman mlngling with the stfled, exultant mockery of a laugb, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again ralled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of them. He found himself in correct with some one, wbam he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\"to whicha loud laugh fucceeded; clnd he felt hjmself grappled by one whose strength seemod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his harids upori his throat—when t The storm was a riow still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torohes fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who bad attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his orror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upori him, to procive the cliry form of his fair conductress brought in a lifcless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosod them, stretched by his side. There was no color vpon ber cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt thcre :—upon her neck and breast was blood, arid upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men polnted, erying, simullarieously struck with horror ,\" A V ampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sido of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He kriew not what his thoughts were —his mind was beriumbed and seemed to have reslection, and lako refuge in vacclncy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the heat. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom another had missed. TheirIamentable cries, as they approached the city, forowarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertclined the causo of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were unconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever. It was often delirious; in these iritervals which would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianlhe—by some unoccountable oombination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would impreclect maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, canceled at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon charge of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attitude. When the lcltter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with thot of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, ignoring almost repentance for the fact that had caused lheir separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His Iordship seemed quite ch changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conualescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey practiced no difference from tho former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed instantly upon him, with a smile of maliciovs exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Rvthven wcls apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breoze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movoless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened, and that the elasticity of spirit which had one so distinguished him now seemed to have fled sor ever. He was now as much o lover ofsolitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul much as he wishodfor solitude, his mind could only find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest voice; then suddenly turriing round, would show, to his wild irnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tendor care had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a collection would be contacted: but though they thus hadtened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the incontion of indiv individual, whose interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with orily a few guards, more to serve as guidos than as a defence. Uporientering, howev er, cl narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought downri from neighbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent lheir regligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, wbon thoy were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guris. In an instant, the guards had lest them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to sire in the directjori when the report came. Lord Rulhven and Aubrcy, imitatiring their example, retired for a moment bchind the sheltoriring turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus d etained by a foe, wha with insulting shouts bade them cldvance, and being exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers should climb above ond lake them iri the rear, they determiriod at once to rush forward in Hardly had they lost the sbelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought a bim to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer beeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and srenderrod.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to canvey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, far which he had an arder. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificalion ensued, and death seemed to be dividing with basty slops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uneonscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was introduced to offering his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assistme! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .,\"Ineed bul little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of mo, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth —orid if my death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying mari, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being long any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, arid he knew not. why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over the bim, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse. When a robber met hiin, and informed him that it was no long here, baving became conveyed by himsels and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they bad given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rerase after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bvt, which he had mounted to the summit to find no trace of either the purse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at least returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently eonspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to the translator to Napes, he oecupied himself in arranging those efforts he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthveri. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of office, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilsl turning them over, and examination their curious forms, what was hif surprise at finding o sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shvddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapori, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the fame varying tirits upon the hast andsheath were alike in splendor on both, and Ieft no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on this way home, Clt Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady hc bad attempt to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductivc arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of the since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. Hc became morose and silent; and his only occupation cansisted iri urging the speed of thepastilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; the cold breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shares; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to love, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of his past. If she was before, by her infantine caresses, she had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more allaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning the graph which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eyes were neverlit up by the levity of the kind benefit. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a sound conscious of a brighter realm. Hor step was not that light footing, which strays where a butlerfly or a colour may attract — it was selected and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smell of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would ln her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchariged her smile for that of this voluptvary? It seemed that if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native speaker. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardiaris more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when it might be her professor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the euents had wilnes sed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. The food arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced called a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While being wasstanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sourided in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hard courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would beat him, when he pereeived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till hls limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the form of a friend, and foreiring a passage through the crowd, be threw himself into a horse carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried stops, and sixed his harids upari his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He moved himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be reol — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask the concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his fister to the collapse of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrourided by several, apparently in earnest conversation; which attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features. he must be absorbed. He sprangforward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forccd her tawards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who wore waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to hiin —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracled. If before his mind had been absorbod by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the moristers living a gain pressed upon this loughls. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was wished. His oath startled him ;— Was he thon to allow this monsterlo roam, breaking ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. Even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to fear the world from such a wretch; but doalh, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this still; shut up in the busy room, he saw no one, and clte only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughthim, for her sake, to support nature. At last, rio is longer capable of bearing ftillness and solitude, to loft his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted the bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the everyiingto to house; but at last he laid him down to reft wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the lead that be left by his absence, the wholc of hisfriends, with a friend arnangst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again inta society, and wate him closely, anxious to frewarn, in spile of this oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, bis haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for beer sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the gvardians though proper to introduce, and, fearing that bis mind was becoming alienoted, they thought it high time to resume clgain thattrust which should be before imposed upon the thcrn by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and suffering he had daily encounter in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they erigaged a physlician to roside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind obsorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for the class, incapable of being roused. Ho had become emacialed, his eyes had attained a glassy luslre ;—thc only sign of affection and recollectionremaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would deslre her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near a shrine !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he answered, the only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a slate, which not even if she could rouse him. This lasted many months gradually, however, as the year was passing, his iricoherences became less frequerit, and his mind thrcw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the dayhe would count upon his singers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed. When, upon the last day of the year, one of the guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumftance of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going the next day to bemarried. Instaritly, Aubreys attentiori was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the introduction, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsderi. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulclte bor upan her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and euery accomplishment; when he suddenly received a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding this features of the monster who had so long influenced bis lise. He scized the portrait in a paroxysm of the crogo, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the refemblancc of her future husband, looked as if he did riot understand her—then seizing her harids, and gaziring on her with a frantic expression of concern, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monsler, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade bim remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thiriking Lord Ruthven wos near him In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who bad beard the whole, and thought thiswaf but a retum of bis disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to thern, he implored, he hegged off the line to delay but for one day. They, attributing this that the insanity they imagined, should take possession of his mind, endeavored to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-roam, and bad became refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's civil health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he was deemod insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly he concealed from those among whom he bad gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by correct attendance, and teprotenee of great affection for his brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His longue had dangors ond toils to rocount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded eclrtb, save with her to whomhe addressed hiinself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had been to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or sucb was the The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for bastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, where he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the fervants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his father, conjuring her, as she valued her own bapplness, her owri honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arrns as a lbeir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that morriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servantf promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night pass passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Auhrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of the busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Every grew almostfrantic. The security of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, which one found was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the opartment where all was neorly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking a hif arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your date, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister just dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himsels; his rage no finding vent, hadbroken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was the first mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as physiciari, was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and brideroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increase; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be c allod, and when the midnight hour had struck, he was related composedly to the reader who had perused him — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadteried to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreyf fister had greeted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING ANACCOUNT OF LDRD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world will all before him, w hero to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Greoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Milylcne, on the island of that naine. The beouly of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, introducing many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantinen; and though just 1ies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the mcn were emplo yed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and inyself took a ram ble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engagod a young Greek as our gulde, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the ifland four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his focus very often to the differentislarids .\"\nThis account exoited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-slained walls, marble lables on either slde, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain benoath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of cl small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa camploted the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book k-case: there were iron mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedehamber had merely a large blanket spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told vs, filled with books and papers, which were then iri a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shokfpcare's,Boileaus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerrnan, in the German language; Klapstock Messioh; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphletf from the Greek press al Conslantinaple, much to rn, but Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. That Messiah was literally scribhled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he soiled, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\" there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I had the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an agod Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long around fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and sret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an warning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnifhed, as upon the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided oway, grapes, aranges and limes were clustoring together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woodenback was placed, on which we were told, the Iord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reoding, writing, and tolking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for him was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vincyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an aneient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was the last in the woods near the mountain base. The fea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a fingle oloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofly chesnut and palm-trecs, fevoral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had reslded in this romantic society: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"TheArmeriian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will only ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If Ican\" said ,\"I dare riot\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but our return to the blue town we learnt several particulars of this folated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the ifland, andeueri danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to thegirls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had a bad loft on his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, while our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to discloso. He hod a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lordwas osten seen walking on the sea-shore, and he bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself to use it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; your imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece would he. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark a popular genius. Arrived at Palermo, call our doubls were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greoce ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from hame; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in over research into the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of retuming to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this sentence, believing it riots quite interesting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as anunfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human riature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The face is directly the reverse, af may be played a little ancestors. All the finor feelings of the heart, so elegantly dopicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in bis bossom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his aclions: and bis courting the repose af solitude is cln additional roa son for marking him as a being on whose heart ReIigion hath set her sea, and ouer whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. Will respect his love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reporls are even to be received with caution, particularly wheri directed against man morcll iritegrity; and he who dares justjfy hjmsels before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a follow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is the worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testirnony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crawn-coll, Fleel-street.",
    "20": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabions it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; clndit has only assumed its present form sinco, the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in theirterritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still ext ant, of the dead rising from their graves, clrid feeding upon the blood of the young clnd beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungclry, Poland, Austrja, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyres nightlyimbibod a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily djed of consvmptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins become distended to such a stote of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a crediblo account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the police, they positively and unonimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, namod Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovja, on the frontiers of the Turkish Seruia, he had been tarmented by vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself This precautation, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, money persoris complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of lives by bis attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in casos of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the inouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, also which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The sarne measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their tummbecome agents upon the other who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person asked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis moristrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other inftance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a fort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to sacrifice, but compolled to confine his infemal visitations solely to those beings he laved most while upon earth—those to whoin he was bound by ties af kindrod and affection .— A supposition allowed to in the \"Giaour\".\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall srom its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blaod of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing But one thatfor the crirne must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless them with the clear father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in the flarne! Yet thou must end thy tclsk and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which sreees over its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hand shall tear The tresfes of her yellow hoir, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affectians fondest pledge was worn—But now is borrie away by the Memoriol of thine agony! Yet with thine own bestblood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tootb, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—cland with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll these in harror sbrink clway from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also intraducated in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire corsc of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the gravc for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purlty and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of soveral astonishing casef of vampyrism, to which be pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has pul forth some learned disserations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barborian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely reinarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one iri mast generol acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THEVAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attericant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of which ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his slngularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might be a lack quell, and throw the foar into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this serisation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: the same attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did nol seem to penetrote, orid at orie glanco lo pierce through to lho inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin itcould not pass. This peculiarities caused bim to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasedat having something in their presence capable of erigaging their ottention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or frointhe strong emotion of passion, though its forrn and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntors after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, atleast, some marks of what they inight term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a But though the commori adultress could only influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, howovor, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hard office. He was af often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as a mang thaso who sully it by their victims.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought about their duty meroly lotake care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the core of merconary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. Ho, had a chance, that high romantic feeling of honour and condor, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was throwri in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the seene, os we feel in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Ho was handsome, srank, and ricb: for those reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, inany mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with Ieast truth, their languishing or rompling favourites: the daughters clt the same time, by their brigh tening courages when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soori led him into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started clt finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no fouridation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relnquish his dreams, where the extraordinary being we had above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tho very irnpossibility of forming an idea of the character of a mari entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidanoo of their contact: cleaning his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensily to clravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into a hera of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon a high notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only wbetted his curiasity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upan an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to clppear as lf fallen from the skies, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of ploa They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from a bim a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed thecircling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the clgobond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not clvoid remarking, that Jl was not upon the uirtuuf, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant everi upon uirtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sont from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligatc came to ask something, not to relieve his wonts, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally propels over the retiring behavior of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstonce about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the Iowest and the most abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which hif companion sought for the centres of all fashionable table: he betted, and always gambled with success, excepl where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even inore than he gained; but it was olways with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed to be In every town, he left the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle he adarned, cursing, in the soljtude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within lhe reached a flhis friend; whilst mony cl father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yel he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsivo grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of oombating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wishes to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own prosit ;— but he deloyed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to bim; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and almost the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spokeless than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greator gratification from it than the correctant excitement of vainlywishing to breclk that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companion; he left bim in daily attendance upon this morning circle of Italian countries, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eoger impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagination that there was an evil power re sident in his companion, these seemed to give him a sussicient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon a hif immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his ljcentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had rcquired, to enhanoc his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urisullied virtue, down to the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all thase femalef wbom he had sougbt, apparentlyon accaun\nAubrey delermined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single brightpoint on which to correct the eye. He resolved to insert some possible prelet for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same article, and soori perceived, that his Lordsbip was endeavauring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with a ln society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plclns in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him all his windings, and soon difcovered that an assigriation had been appointed, which would most likely erid in the ruin of an innocent, though thaughtless girl. Losing no tired, he eritered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that half intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed when he intended to marry her, meroly laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, we must decline accompanying his Lordship in theremainder of their proposed tour, he ordered a bis servant to seek other apartments, and calling the company of the lady, informed her of all he knew, only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was preve-\nct: intended. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his favor to notify her complete assent to a separation; but did not hint only sus-\nThe point of his plans has been foiled by Auhreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Peninfula, soon found himself at Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; arid soon occvpicd himself in lracing the faded records of ancient glory upon inonumenls that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemon only before slaves, had bidden the emselues beneath the sheltering soil or mariy coloured licheri. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautisul and delicate, that sbe might have formed the madel for a pointer wishing to pourtray on conclss the prornised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any order to think she could belong to those who had no sauls. As she danoed upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would bave thought lhe gazelle a poor type of her boauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of ariimated naturo, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often acoompanied Avbrey in his search after antiquities, and often would be uncorisoious girl, changed in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eagor gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deoyphcred upon an almost effaced tablet, in the coritemplation of her sylpb-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, as sheflilted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delioately brillianland swiftly fading hues, will might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he held before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a possage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocerice, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawingrooms arid stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would sland by, and watch the mogic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the circling dance upon the open ploin, wauld paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind Her e clrnestness arid apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told hiin the tale of the living vclmpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of the living vclmpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of the esuiring months, b even, remarked that those who bad dared to question their existence, always had some proof givon, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to bim the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her seors, though clt the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to catch himself more arid more to Ianthe; her innocence, sa contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he badly sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari uneduated Gre ek girl, still he found himself mare and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at tirncs from her, clnd, forming a plari for some antiquariari research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; bvt he always found it impossible to fix his contentiori upon the ruiris around him, whilst in his mind be retclined an image that seemed alone to be rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from biin with reluctance; but will wcls because she bad no longer clny one with whom she could visit her fav-\nourite haurits, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to my parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of the bus excursions, which was to detairi him for a few hours; when theyheard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to returnat night, as he must necessarily pass through a waod, where no Greek would ever remain, after the doy had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them sbudder at a hif darling thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unottended; he was surprised to observe the melancboly face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earriestly begged of a bim to return, there night ollowed the power of these beings to be pul iri action ;—bo promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gother into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his head, determined to make up by speed for his delay: butil was too late. Twilight, in these southerri climates, also almost urikriown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: when he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing tbunders had scarcely the air interval of results thick heavy rain forced its woy through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took a flight, and was carried with a profound rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and be found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted himself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trying to obtain a letter from the pelting of the storin. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womari mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;— he was start-\nled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the open door of the hut. Hefound himself in outer darkness: sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he collled, the sounds continued, and no notice was the takeri of him. He found himself in cantact with some one, whom hc immediately sejzod; when o vaice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to whlch a loud laugh succeeded; and he felthimself grappled by one wbose strength seemed superhuman: determjned to sell his lifc as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and kneeling up on his breast, had placed his hands upon his t The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by the lhose without. They entered; the light of their torchef fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Avbrey tbey searohed for her who had attracted bimby her cries; he was again left ln darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more bvrst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductross brought in a lifeless course. He shut hif eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was a rio colour upori her cheek, not even upon a ber lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to lhis the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him to object to so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died without her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbod and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost uneonsciously iri his hand, a naked dagger of a particular constructian, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whorn, a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophes. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at the brewery, and pointed to the course. They were incorisolable; both died, broker-hearted.\nAubrey being pulled to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals would be called upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable eombination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate the meaning of his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ehanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing the sign of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recorded from his delirium, he was horrified and starlled at thesight of him whose image he had known combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kirid words, impIying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wba had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to berapid, he again g gradually returned into the sarne state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious oxultation playing upan hif lips: he knew not why, but During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of lhose orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, waf much welcomed, and that the elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished hirn now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atbens; if he soughl il in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly tvrning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lard Ruthven, who he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They beard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invenlion of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, ot the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large mosfes of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent their intelligence; for scarc ely were the whole of the party enga ged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echood report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, imilating the ir example, retired for a moment before the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of bcing thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbors should climb above and take them in the rear, lhcy delermined at once to rush forward in search of the eryery. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy hosted his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contents or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon the Lord. Ruthvens being wounded, immediately tbrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransam, he was no more dislurbed by their presence meroly to guard the entrance lill their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two dclys mortification orisued, and death secmed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneclsy, and his eye often fixed upan Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do ariy thing,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I necd but a little —my life ebbs apace — I carinot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honovr was free from staln in the world's mouth — and if mydeath wero known for the same time in England —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be a friend. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rajsing himself with exultant violenco ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your natural fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crirnes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon this pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knows not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as is from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having beeri conveyed by himself and comra des, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonisbed, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bul, when he had mourited to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clotbes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returried, convinced that they had bvried to Europe for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of cl country in which he had met with such terrible misforturies, and in which all apparently oonspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized uponhis mind, be resolved to leave it, arid soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhvon. Amongst other things, there was a cold case containing several weapons of offenco, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curiovs form, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently ornamented in the same style cls the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—bastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peouliarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular f orm, thesevarying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both land and left no room for daubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sinyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were conceming the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arls. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been ard of since the departure of his lordship. Abrcy's mind became almost broken urider, so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became a morose arid silent; and his only occupation eonsisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which soemed obedienl to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hostened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embra ces and cclresses of his sister, all the memory of the pasl. If she before, by her infantine caressos, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more athletic as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gained the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of acrowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a color may attract — it was sedale and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs. she knew he destroyed his rest, who would have changed her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it was having been thought by her guardians to make fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the each other entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have a romainod iri tbe mansion of his father, and fod upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interefl about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arranged as a drawing-room.\nThe word was excessive — the drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, hcedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time hod seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, arid o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Rernember your oath .\" Ho had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceivod, at a little distanco, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he lhrew himself into his earlier age, arid was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from his broiri. Lord Ruthvon again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array—the daggcr—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe possihle—thedead rose again !— He thought his imagination had coniured up the image his mind was resting upon. I was impossible that it could be real — which determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he wastempted to ask conceming Lord Ruthven, the name bung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relatives. Leaving her under the protection of a inatran, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were loaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; be attempted topass and get near her, wbenone, whomhe requested tomove, turned rourid, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprarig forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, soreed her towards the street: at the door he found bimself impeded by the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; arid while he was engaged in possing them. He again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost destroyed. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was just engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she wanted to explain to her what had eased his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Does oath startled him ;— was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would love him? He thought of employing his own hand to fear the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and atc only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamod from street to street, anxiaus to fly that image which haunted the bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanocd by him who found a pressure swister than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch them closely, anxious to forcwarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at least obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Whon, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time toresume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thern by Aubreys parents.\nDe sirous of sclving him from the injuries andsufferings he had daily encounter in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those rnarks or what they considered folly, they engaged a cl physician to reside in the house, and lake constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became in the last so great, that he was joined in to his chamber. There would often lie for days, the inoapable of being roused. He became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and rocollectian remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When however-\nHere, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, when only even a soul could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day who would count upon his fingers a definite number, and their smile.\nThe timehad nearly elapsod, when, upan tho last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy eircumstanoe of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next directly to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Cell of Marsden. Thinking this was a yourig Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, arid astonished them ftill more by his expressing bis inlention to be present of the nuptials, and deciding to see this sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irisluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her cheek to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a perfon so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; operiing it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the manster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, the orid trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, be looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on hcr with a fraritic expression of countenanee, he bade her swear that she would never write this monstcr, for he— But he would not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bad. him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, lhinking Lord Ruthven was noar him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physiciari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a result of his disorder, eritered, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be implored, he bogged of them to doloy the best for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he beard of Aubreys ill health, he really understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exullation and pleasuro could hardly be concealed from those ainong whom had gained this information. He haftened to the house of his former companion, and, by constarit atlendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually wrote the eor of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dclngors and toils to recount—could speak of hjmfels as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the erowded earth, sove with her to whom he addressed himfelf ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that be might listen to ber soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use this serpent's art, or sucb was the will The total of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as ari ccufe for hastening tho inarriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to lake place the very day before his departure for the conlinent.\nAubroy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she volunteered her own happiness, her own horoour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who ance held her in their clrms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that morriage, on which he denounced the Nobel heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; butgiving it to the physician, being though it was better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a mariiac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmatos of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that more oasily be conceived than described, the nates of busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Every great romantic. The curiosity of the scruarits at least overcome their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an ari helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one board wall over the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his room by sorcc, hurried him from the room, speechless with ragc. When on the staircafe, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his eclr —\"Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride's long day, your sister is dishorioured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendarits, who, roused by the old woman, had come in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, bad broken blood-vessel, and he was continued to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAbbreys weakries increased; the effusion of blood provided symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related the company sedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Avbrey's sister had got the trust of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LONEY RESIDENCEIN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before the film, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his advice .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majestys vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mityleric, on the island of the thal name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had thore,induee many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantinen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landcd; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walering, and the purser bargaining sor cottle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had a boeri before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us to come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in this festival. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good Indian. The cottage aver the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old inan in charge of il: he gavo Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred Chinese for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our university very much, and we lost no time in hostening to the house where our countryman had resigned. We were kindly received by an old man, who corrected us over this mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-foot — an entrance hall, adrawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centrc, arid a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring sixedin tbe side of a small bronze Venus in a learing posture; a large couch or sofa complexed furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fine painting. The bedchainber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed through Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeares, Bail-\neau, arid Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Empires; Zimmermon, in the German language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradisc Last, an Italian odition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamplets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tom, but from the English book of any doscription. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Lotin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, arid markod with slips of paper, on which also were marks.\nThe old mon sald :\"Tbe lord had been reading these books the evening before he sold, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must look until his return; for hc is so particular, that were I to mave the original thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did hlm a service; and I have the produce of the farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Arrnenian who resides in a single cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know sor what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extremely pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pilars with black plinths andfret-work carnices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of a strong coarselinen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon thein the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, dr inking light wines, such as \"lachryma chr isti\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limef were clustering together on its borders, and urider the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornam metal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his eve-\nrings and night till twelve clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man ,\" praying\" for his very devout ,\" and always altended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be told \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and took the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a singleeloud, terminates the view in sront; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and pamtrees, several small islands were clearly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless asto the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitudo: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"Is I a woman,\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We did not like to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who live wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost hisown in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and innovative character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a moft beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmatiori with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mjtylene; our imaginations call on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: be had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those characteristics which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were displayed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who bad heen travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of this lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe HaroIde\" being put into our bands, we recognized the reoluse of Calcla in every place. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consolod our elues with the idea of returning to Mitylene on the fine future today; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been gradually slandered. He has been described as an unseeling disposition, oversealing to assoclating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. The fact is directly reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in half lordships, seem to have their seat in the bis bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and this courting the repose of solitude also an additional reason for marking him as a being on whofe hearl Roligion halh set her seal, and over whose head Benevalence hath thrown her manlle. No man can read the preceding passing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryinan. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's morol integrily; and he who dares justlfy himself before thatawful trihunal wbero all must appear, alone may censuro the crrors of a sellow-morta 1. LordByron's character is worthy of his genius.

It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chicf and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously afsirmed, thal, about five years before, a eortajn Heyduke, riamed Arnold Poul, had heard to say that, at Cassovia, ori the frantiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by cl vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the\na grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consult their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (af is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from eorruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proos having been thus obtained, they resorted to this accusuted reinedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadsully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, bur needed his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the eorses of lhase people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agerits upon others who survived them.\nThis universal belief is that a cell person suffered by a vam-\nThe price becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monslrous rodomontade is bere related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of these present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heirious crime committed wbilst in existence, that the deoeased is not only doomed to uampyrise, but complicated to confine his infernal visitations solely to those heings heloved most while upon earth—those to whom be bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy curse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly havent the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stroam of life; Yet loathe the banq uet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing the But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best beloued of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame!

Yet with thine own best blood sball drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits raue, Till these ln horror shrk away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire curse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him the best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinsulness of her life, she being poured through the whole of the table as a complete type of purity and lnnocence. The veracious Taurnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretended to have been ari eycwitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be an elassical, as well as barbaricln errar.\nMany curious and interesting nolices on this sirigularly horrible superstitjon might be added; though the present may susfice for the limits of a note, recessarily deuoted to explanalion, orid which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the terin Varnpyre is the one in most gene-\nreal acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: such as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Gaul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the most dissipationsattendant upon the cold London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularilies, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could only participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he rnight by a look quell it, and tbrow fear into those breasts where thaughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance lo piorce through lo the inward workings of the heart; bul fell upon the cheek with a Ieaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; also wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of enriui, were pleased at having something in their prefenco capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though itsform and outlirie were beautiful, many of the female hunlors after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they rnight torm asfection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sbewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put But though the common adults could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent. to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he had ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; could whether it was that it even over-\nmake the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by bis apparent hatred of love, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their voices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Arthury: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians who thought that it their duty morely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to be aware of mercenary svbalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily routine means so many brilliant apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that voice was thrown in by Prouidence merely for the picturesque effect of the sceno, or we sec iri romancef: he thought that the misery of acotlage merely consisted of the vesling of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Ho was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into thc gay circles, many mothers surrounded hirn, striving which should describe with least truth, their lariguishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightering countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his Ilps, soon led him to false notians of his talents and his merit. Attached as he waf to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starlled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that fllckered, not from the presence of a gbost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congerles of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above desoribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and tbo very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorted ln himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, then the ta cit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allawing his imagination to picture euery thinking that flatterod its propensity to exlravagant ideas, he soon formed this objecl into the hero 0 He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. Ho gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, afraid soon found, from the noles of preparation in — Street, that who was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted hiscuriosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid sleps in the care of the vice towards pulting lhemselves upon an equality with to aged, and not allowed them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandcllous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or  They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his contents to Lord Rutbven, who was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a cold mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, who gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubreyhad had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthvenf character, and riow he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His pronunciation was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from a high hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubroy could not clvoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigoncc by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with bardly suppressed sneers; bul when the profligate came to afk somcthing, nat to relieve hif wants, but to allow him towallow inhis lust, or to sink him still deeper in his in This was, however, attrihuted by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring basbuffs of the virtuous indigent. Thero was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: also thase upon whom it was bestowed, inovitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the parenteagerness which his companion sought for the centres of all fashioriable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of this faro table: he bett-\ned, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his anlagonist, and lhen he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he gonerally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he ericountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous s amlly; thon bis very wjsh seemed fortune's law—thisapparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his In every town, he left the formerly affluont youth, lorn from the circle headorned, cvrsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drowned him with hin the reach of this friend; whilst many a sather sot frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive g rasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reprefent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved therujn of oll, and did not tend to his own profit ;—bul he delayed it—sor each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and poponly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his earriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; clnd though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gralification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myste ry, which to his exolted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he lofted him in daily attendance upon this morning the circle of an Italian country, whilft he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whist be was thus engclged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his gvardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residonl in his companian, these seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the passession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discavered, thal his contempt for the adults had nol originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to erihance his gratificotiori, that his victum, the partner of his guill, should be hurled from the piririacle of unsullied uirtue, down to the lowest abyss af insamy and degradation: in fine, that all thase females whom he had fought,\nAubrey determined upon losing one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plavsible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to a lot no slight circumstances poss by notice. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endoavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that cln unrnorried female is inet with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys cye followed him in call his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthvcn, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, forming him at the fame time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthveri answered that his intentions were such af he supposed all would have been such an occasion; arid upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying hif Lordship in the remainder of theirproposed tour, which ordered his servant to seek other complaints, arid calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to ber daughler, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The translation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his soruant to notify her complete consent to aseparation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the saded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden lhemselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured material. Urider the same roof as himself, existed a being, of beautisul clnd dclicate, that she might have sormed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on eanvass the promised hope of the faithful iri Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dariced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountainside, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; sar who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an animated naluro, for that sleepy luxurious look of the ariimal suit but to the tasle of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey iri his search after antiquities, arid often would uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a K ashmerc butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the oontemplation of ber sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses fall, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fadiring hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, wbo let escape from his mind the very objoct he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing rooms and ftifling balls. Whilst he drew tbose remains of which he wisbed to preprecture a memorial for his future hours, she would starid by, and watch the magic effects of bis pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hlm the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hirn ln all the glowing colours of yaulbful memory, the marriage point remembered viewing in her infaney; and then, turning to subjects that Her earncstness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even af Aubrey; arid oflen as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would ruri cold, whilst he attended to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe cited to believe her, for it had been, remarked that those who had dared to question their existence, always hodsome proos giveri, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed him to the traditional appearance of the se monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rutbven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the fame time he wondered about many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the superncltural power of Lard Ruthven.\nAubrey beg an to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romarice, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducatedGreek girl, still he sound himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself clt times from her, and, forming a plan for some anliquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an ari image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever that some frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from hjm with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with a several present, offirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very anime. Soan after, Aubrey determined to proceed upan one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to relurn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a world, where rio Greek would ever rernairi, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the companies in their nocturnal origins, and denoun-\nced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatterided; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, held spelled them with such terror. When the book was about to depart, Iaritbe came to the side of his horse, and carnestly begged to him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that dcly-light would end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gatber into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon that devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he had a bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its ochoing thunderf had scarcoly an intorval of rest—its thick heavy rojn forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst they have forked lightniring seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the critangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surroved it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelling of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of cl woman mjngling with the stifled, exultarit mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uribroken sound ;—he was slartled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced him to open the door of the hut. He sounds himself in utter darkness: the food, bowever, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds c continued, and no notice was taken of a bim. He found hiinself iri contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he sent himself grappled by one whose strength seomcd superhuman: determiried to sell his life as dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was in valn: he was lfted from his feet and kneeling upon his breast, bad placed his hands upon his throat—when the  The storm was now still l; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fcll upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. Al the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her crics; he was again Iefl in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches one more burst vpon hirn, to perceive theairy sorm of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a question arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the saine forin, when he closed them, stretched by his side. There was no colover upan her cheek, not an oven upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as lhe life that one dwelt there :—upon her neck and breasl was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A cmyre!  Vampire !\" A little was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the side of her who had a lotely been to him the object of so mariy bright and fairy visitors, now falleri with the flower of lise that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemod to sbun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different partners who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentablecries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophes. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascerlained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable cambiriation he soemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledietians upon his head, and curse him called her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, changed at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon heclring of the state of Aubrey, immediately ploced himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from bis delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now cambined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rulhvcn, by his kind words, implying almost repentance far from the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the atlerition, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconclled him to this presence. His lordshjp seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as bis convalesconce began to bc rapid, he again gradually retjred into the fame state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived rio difference from the former inan, except lbat clt times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed lently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew During the last stage of the inval ids recovery, Lord Rvthven was apparently engaged in watching the tldeless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude arid silence as Lord Ruthven; but mueh as he wished for solltude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of tbe modest violet; then su ddenly turniring rovnd, would show, ta his wild imogination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom be held himself bound by the tender core he had taken of him during this illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection would be attached: but though they thus hadteried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangors. Iri consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on an occasion they travelled with orily a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with lorge masses of rock brought dawri from the neighhouring precipices, they had the reason to reperit their negligence; for scarcely wero the whole of the parly erigaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several gvris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthvon on Auhrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shctering turri of tbe defile: but ashamed of being lbuf detained by a foe, who with jnsulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. HardIy had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a cl shot in the shoulder, which broughl hiin to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, na langer hceding the contest or his own pcril, was saon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces orou and him—his guards have ng, upon Lord Rulbvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—tbey being cantent merely to guard the entrance till their comrado sbould return with the promised sum, far which he had an order r. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days morlifieation ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious and pain. os hc had been of the objects about bim: bul towards the close of the last evening, his mind became completely urieasy, arid his eyc aften sixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you wanna save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I have the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honor, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any tbing,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but a little —my lifeehbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honor was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if many deaths were unknown for some time in England —I — I — but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swoar !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violence, swearing by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swearing that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to arily living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed to be rusting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; he many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shower came over him, as if from the presentiinent of something horrible awaiting him. Rlsing early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the throfe, when a rabber met him, and irifarmed hlm that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by bimself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise. they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avbroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the svmmit, he found no trace of either the eorpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the scale of the clothes.\nThe army of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently eanspired to beighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects, he had while belonging to Lord Ruthuen. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offer, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alagharis. Whilst turning them over, and exarnining their ourious forms, what was hif furprise at finding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, be found the weapon, and his horror may be imagiried when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held iri his harid. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the heart and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the ladyhe had attempted to snatch from Lord. Ruthvcns, seductive arts. Her parents were in distross, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destrayer of Ianthe. He ecarne morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted iri ur ging the speed of thepostilions, as if he were going to save the life of some once he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which feemed obedient to his will, soon waftcd hiin to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, sor a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraccs and classes of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infaritine earesses, had gained his affection, and now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-root assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misforlvne, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indlcate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which slrays where a butterfly or a color may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget that griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for half of the victory? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only cighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was having been thought by her guardians more fit than her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her proteclor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed up with the melancholy which over-\nct: he powered him. He could not speak interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind held beon so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawingroom.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, haftenod thith-\nhere. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilo he was standing in a corner by himself, hcedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had been Lard Rvthven was in that very place —he felt himself suddenly seized by them orm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oclth .\" He had a hard courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would hlast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till hislimbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, andforcing a passage through the crowd, which threw himself into a carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he wore afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthveri again before him —circumstances st arted up in a dreadsul array —tho dagger —his oath .— He raused hiinself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. I was impossible that I would be roal — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthvon, the name having upon his lips, and he could riot succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister taking the clssembly of cl near the relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by soveral, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom was requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door hesound hiinfelf impeded by the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing tbern, he agaln heclrd that voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"-\n— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, afraid it was in vain that she intreated him to explore that beer what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only ultered a few words, afraid of those terrified hours. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His path slartled biin ;—waf he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, a midst will be held dear, and not hurt its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if we were to break his oath, arid discuss his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, which remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he reinained in this state; shut up in his roam, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support the culture. At last, no longer capable of bearing skills and solitude, he left his house, rammed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became unexpected, and was wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun club to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to resl wherever the fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend arnongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter clgain jnlo fociety, and wotch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered a room, his haggard and suspioious looks were so striking, bis inward shudderings so visible, that his sisler was cut last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeling, sor her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved uriavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which should be before imposed upon them by Aubreys parerits.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he hold daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing bim from exposing to the gen real eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His ineoherence became calm last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, the increase of boring ed. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy structure ;— the onlysign of affection and reeolleotion reinaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with laoks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her riot to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do only go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"Trve! True !\" and again sank into a state, whonce not even if he could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and hls mind threw off the opportunity of its gloom, whilst his guardlans observed that several times on this day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe tired bad nearly elapsed. When, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began toconversc with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so powerful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attractive; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they seared, he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in focusiety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again eapable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, arid kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flawing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of an affectian. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockel upon her broast; opening it, what was his surprise to beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He soized the portralt in a paroxysm of rage, and trained it under foot. Upan her afking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, who looked as if he did riot uriderstand her —tben seizing her hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expression of cavntenanee, he bade her swear that she would never wed this mansler, for he — But he cauld not advance — it seemed as if the thal voice clgain bade bim remember his oath In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered,arid forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He felt upon his kriees to lhem, he implored, he bogged of them to delay, but for one day. They, attracting this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and returned.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming after being a drawing-room, and had been cured with everyone else. When he heard of Avbreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of just; but when he learned that he was deemed an irisane, his exultclution and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those wrong whorn he had gone this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the board of Mifs Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tails to recount—could speak of bimseIf as of an individual having no sympathy with any bcing on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, siricc he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to vse the serpent ort, or such was the will of fate, that he The title of the el der branch falling ot length to bim, hc oblained an important embassy, which served as cln excuse sor hastening the rnarriage ,( in spite of her brother's derangedstate ,) which was to take place the very day before a bis departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once beld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy ourselves. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost fantastic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the study of a belpless old woman. How seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with the rope. When on the staircase, Lord Rut-\nwhen whispered in his ear —\"Remember your oath, and know, if not a funny bride to day, your sister is dishonourd. Women are careful !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was soleminated, and the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He disguised his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he said immediately after.\nThe guardians havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; what when they arrived?\ncold, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\nct :\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence is guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelclgo, on board one of his Majesly vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of eclttle and vegetable always to be had there. I endure many British vessels to visit it—botb men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies ratheroul of the track for ships bound to Sinyrna, its bodies amply repay for the deviation of a voyoge. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the baby, and whilst the mcri were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so nclmed) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he bad comc from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said there ,\"and would have taken a lot with him; but I did not choose to quit Mltylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The coltage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, arid ho has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zochines for it ,( about L 250 English currenoy ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the disferent islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we loft no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had decided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments from the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting par lour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closct annexed. They were still simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, alarge myrtle in the centre, clnd a small fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed iri, the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English eane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber hadmercly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-roorn we observed a marble recoss, formerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamaris closet in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablot of the recess lay Voltaires, Shclkspeare's, Boileaus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues nove 1s; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; sevcral smal pamphlets from the Greek press at Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with penoil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally soribbled all over, and inarked with the slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old inan said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without order, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I play to an agod Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. This portioo in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted inarble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corriices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone baluftrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are also furnished, as upon them, the Grecks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christle\", eating sruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlel glided away, grapes, oranges and llmes were oIustering together on its horders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with ari ornamental wooden back was placed, ori which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve oelock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\"orid always tended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins described in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horjzori unshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lafty chesnut and palm-lrees, several small islands were distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said ourconductor ,\"cold tell, but I am sure to be well not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, ald friend?\" said I ,\"If I cari,\" saidhe ,\"I dare not\". We do not have time to visit the Arinenian, but on our return to the lower we learntseveral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was also upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses, lo others, and cotton and said to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and berievolent character. One circumslance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had the most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had baughl her piano-forto, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the clock, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. How hard money it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geriius. Arrived at Palermo, also our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"About whom you are so anxiaus, is Lard Byrori; I mcl him in my travel on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his leadership fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been moro curiaus in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me that day will be a neuer return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships, a good crime, which has been grossly sla indeed. He has been described as an unfceling passion, averse to associating with human nature, or contacting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to just pleasures. The fact also directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the sirier feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seeing to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatby, and oharity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting to repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and overwhose hoad Beneuolence hath throwri her mantle. No man can read the preceding passing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume that gives opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart, orid self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cover, Fleet-street.",
    "22": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this place is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be oommon: it did riot, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and il has only assumed its presentfarm sinoe the division of the Latin ond Greck churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body would not corrupt if used in their tcrritary, it gradually increased, and formed the subj ect of many wonderful storles, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where the belief exists, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaci ated, lost their strength.\nth, and specdily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to sueh a state of repletion, as to cause blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin.\nIn the Londori Journal, of March ,1732, is o curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of compyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commarider-in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unaniinously affirmod, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hcard to say, that, ot Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid bimself of the ovil, by eating some of the earth This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition waf made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further misehief, the jhabitarits having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus abandoned, they resorted to the infamous remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried over most dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut the bis head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agerits upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyro becomes a hammer himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThismonstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject as the present observations than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst lri existence, that the deceased is not only doomed lo vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loued most while upon earth—those to whom he was baund by the tief of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBvt first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt thenative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Therefrom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streclm of life; Yet loathe the bariquet which perforce Musl feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall know lhedemon for lbeir si As cursing them, though cursing them, the flowers are withered on the stem. But one that sor thy crime must sell, Tbe youngest, the best beloved of all shall bless thee with a father's name — That ward shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thov musl end the task and mark Her cheek's last lingc—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw which freezes over its life1oss blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellowhair, Of which, in life cl lock when shorn Affections worn—But now is borne away by the Memorial of tbine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sbrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Suthoy has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalabo,\" the vampyre curse of the Arabianmaid Oneizo, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loveswhilst in existence. But this c cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sjnfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innoccance. The voracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several aftonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, bas pul sorth some learned dissertations, teridiring to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany ouriaus and inleresting notices on thif singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the prefentmay suffice for the limits of a riote, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with il, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, VardouIacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the most of the dissipaltions attended upon a Lo ndon winler, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirror around the hiin, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracled his altention, that he might be quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughts reigned. Those who selt this sensation of awe, couldnot explain whence it arose: somo clttributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upontbe object face, did not seem to penelrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; also wished to see him, and those who had been accustorned of violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at hauing something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which riever gained a warmcr tint, either from the blufh of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after noloriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn iri drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw berself iri his way, and did But though the common actress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sox was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent situation with which be spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He hcld, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it wcls that it even overcame the dread of his siriguar character, or that they were moved by his apparent bcltred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domeslie virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardianf, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of the former subalterris, he cultivated more basic imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candor, which dajly ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all lo sympathisc with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: hc thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisled in the bouquet of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured palches. He thought, in fine, that the love dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was hondsome, fronk, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his enlering irito, gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least through their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenancos when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into folse notjons of bis talent and his merit. Attached as he waf to the romance of hif solitary hours, he started at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax eandles that flied, not from the presonce of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, someone coinpenfalion in his gratitude vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea as the character of a mcln entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by tho avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture euery thing that flattered ils propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his sancy, rather than the person hefor He became acquainted with him, paid him attenlions, and fo far advanced upori his notloe, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting this singular character, who, lill now, had only wbetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tou r, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to lake some rapid steps in the caroer of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allawing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the benefits of pleasantry or of praise, They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentloning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from their proposal to join him. Finished by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity as studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his third more than enough torelieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant cvenupon virtue, that he beslowed his alarms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he waf sent away with rich This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the viclous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtual ind-\nthe right. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most object misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avbrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the faro table: he betled, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper wos his antagonisl, and then he lost even rnore than he gained; but it was cllways with the same unchanging face, with which be gonerally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthfvl riovic In every town, who left the formcrly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of cl dungeon, the fate that hcld drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many fathers sat frclntie, amid the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith lo buy even susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder had just snatched from the courageous grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend.\nend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved to be a ruin of all, and did not tend to hold own. profit ;— but he delayed it — foreach day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this test occurred. Lord Ru then in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenef of nature, wcls alwaysthe same: his eye spake less than his lip; and trough Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to hreclk thal myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something superriatural.\nThoy soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left home in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst we went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst he was this engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affectiori; the others were from guardians, the latter ostonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that this character was dreadfully vicious, for that the posse ssion of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his liccntious habits more dangerous to society. It had been difcovered, that his contempt for lhe adultrcs had not originated in hcltred of her character; but that he had required, to onhance his gratification, thal bif uictim, lhe partnor of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unfullied virlue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that cll those females whom he had sought,\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single right point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, pursuing, in the mean while, watching him more closely, and that let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He enlered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly feared. In Ilaly, it is seldom that an urimarried semale is met with in socioty; he was therefore able to carry on his plans insecrot; but Aubreys eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an inriocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intenlions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that these intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry beer, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must describe accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his seruant to seek other patients, and ealling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The passage was presented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complcte assenl to a scporation; bvt did not hint any suspicious of his plans having heen foiled his Aubreys iriterposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Penirisula, soon found himself at Alhens. Hc then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had biddon themselves benoath the sheltering soil or a lion caloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful arid delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter washing to pourtray on canvass like promised hope of the faithful iri Mahomets parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upori the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of ber beautles; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in this search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of beer form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an olmost-affaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her stress falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from this mind to the very object he had before the thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all seem, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew lhose remains of which he wished to preserve cl memorial for his future hourf, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, ln tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the ciroling dance upon the open plain, would painl, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful inemory, themarrlage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, tuming to subjects that had evidently made Her earnestries and apparent belief of what she narraled, excited about the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she taldhim thetale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and the greatest tics, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fernale. lol prolong his existence far the erisujng moriths, his blood would run oold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible sclntasjes; bvt Ianthe clted to hiin the names ofold mcn, who had at last detected one living among themselves. After several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with the stamp of the friend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her irinocence, so contrastod with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought forhis vislonof romanco, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an urieducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, delermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to flx his attention to the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained on the iinage that seemed alone to a iinage that seemed alone to righful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infaritile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but just was because she had no longer ariy one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst herguardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escoped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very time. Soon after, Avbrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detairi him for a sew hours; when they beard the name of the place, they all at once hegged of hiin not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after that day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the inost hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melanc holy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mooring the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When it was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earriestly bogged of hlm to return, ere might allow the power of these beings to be put in aclion ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gother into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere hehad advanced far, the power of the storin was above—itf echoing thunders had scareely an intervol of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, while the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate al his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and was carried with a dreadful rapidity through this entangled foresl. The animal at last, though fatiguc, stopped, and he found, by the gate of lightning, thal he was in the nejghbourhood of a hovel that hardlylifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and broadwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some once to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment, failed, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mjngling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced upon the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Hc was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in correctact with some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a volce cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh sueceedd; and felt himself grappled by one whose ftrength seemed superhumari: determined to fall his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his face and hurled with cnormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him The story was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon hoard by those without. They enlered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flokes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; which was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, whon the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive this airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He should his eyes, hoping that just was a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he closed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness clhout her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood. d, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this, the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were —his mind was believed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vaoancy — which held almost uncansciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon sent by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the cily, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they asoertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the correct. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearled.\nAubrey being put to bed was squeed with a most uiolenl fever, and was often delicious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some uriaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spa re that being ho loved. At other times, he would inprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ohanced at this time to arrive at Athons, and, from whatever motion, the upan hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and hecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impying almost repentance for the found that had caused their separation, and still rnore by attention, anxiety, and care which he sbowed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being wbo had so aslonished Aubrey; but as soon as hls conualescence began to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio difserencc froin the formor man, excepl thatat times was surprised to meot bis gaze fixed intently upon him, with a sinile of malicious exultation playing upon bis lips:  During the last stage of the rivalids, Reaverylord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cool breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the inoveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that the elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have sled for ever. He will now as much cl lover of soIitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbaurhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modcst violet; then sudde-\nonly turning the round, would show, to his wild lrnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a more smile upon her lips. He determined to fly the scene, every feature of which created such bitter associatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom heheld himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, arid sought every spot to which a recollectiori could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed riot to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a dofenc e. Upon entering, however, clnarraw defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, with large inosses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for searcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating lheir example, retired for a moment behind the sherting turn of the defile: bul ashamed of boing thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them aduance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if the clny of the robbers should climb above arid take them in the reor, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly, should they lose the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy bastened to his assiftance; clnd, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was so surprised by seeing the robbors' faces around him — his guards having, upori Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; and having agreod upan a ransom, he waf no more difturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till theircomrade should rctum with the promised sum, for which he held an order. Lord Rutbvenf strength rapidly decreased; in the long days inortificationened, and death seemed advancing withhosty steps. His conduct and appearance had nol changed; he seemed as vnconsclous of pcliri as he had been of these objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mirid became apparently uneasy, and hls cye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of iny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save iny honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I nced but little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and my death was unknown for some time in England —I — I — about life. \"—\" It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of many crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their stomachs :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he said laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upori his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting a bim. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met hiin, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrecy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he fourid no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though two robbers wore they polnted out the identical rock on which they had laid the badly. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at least relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of the local country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to hear that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted toensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently omamented in the same style as the dagger discove red in the fatal hut—hhh shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it sitted, thou gh peculiarly shaped, the shock he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquirief was concerning the lady he hadattempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvonf seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrcy's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady should fallcn a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. Hc became morose arid silent; and his only occupation oonsisted urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some order he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafled bim to the English shores; and he hostened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and carcfses of his sister, all the memory of the post. If she before, by her infantinecaresses, child gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attacking as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey should not have a winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of this drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliaricy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy oharm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunc, but from some feeling within, that appcared to indicate a soul consciousness of a brighter realm. Her sleep was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may be altract — it was sedate and precise. When alone, her face was never brought by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her prefence forget those griofs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentaliori should be delayed until her brother returned from the conti-\nThen, when he might be her protector. I was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-rooin, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the\"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, where his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the real day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held sor along time, and all who were anxious to bask in the size of royalty, hastoned thilhor. ct: Aubrey was there with my sister. While he was slanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your wall. \"He had hordly courage to turn, searful of feeling a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till hif limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through thecrowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. Ho paced the room with hurriod steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven agaln before him—circumstances started vp in a droadful array—the dagger—bis oclth .— He roused him eIf he could not helieve it possible—the dead rise agaln !— He thought his imagination had conjured up that image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be called —he dotermined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask cancerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he would not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by sevoral, apparently in the oarnest conversation; he attempted to pass the clnd get near her, when ono, whom requested to move, tumed round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, farced her towards the street: al the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; clnd while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voico whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been covered by a nice subject, bow much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sislerattentions were now uriheeded, and it was in uoin that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his bankruptcy conduct. He only uttered a few words, and he terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled hlm ;— was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert just progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a witch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, bought him, for her sake, to support the culture. At last, no longer the oapable of bearing stillness and slitudc, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to flytbal image which haunted him. His dress becomes unglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-\n-day the sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to lhe he had; but at least laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow the bim; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pressure swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abscnee the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose prefence they were uriconscious, he delermined to enter again into sooiety, and watch him closely, anxlous lo forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached withintimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so slriking, his iriward shudderings so impossible, that his sister was at last able to beg of him to abstairi from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought propor to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upon them by Aubrcy's parents.\nDeslrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, clnd of preveriting him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and lake constarit care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often be a life for days, the problem of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— he only signed off affoctiori and recollection remoriing displayed himself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that she really afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch the hair — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, be iriquired to whom he referrod, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even a shecould rouse him. This lostod many manths: gradually, bowever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portlon of its gloom, which his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definito riumber, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly clapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, once of hisguardians entering his room, began to converse with bis physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being it was such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been depressed, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he hadmet with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptiols, and desiring to see his sister. They ariswore not, but in sew minutes his sister waf with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother heing onco more alive tothe feelings of affectlon. He began to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had to long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of the group, and trampled it under foot. Upon hor asking him why he thus deslroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he looked as he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of counlence, he bade hor swear that she would never wed this monster, for be — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice ogain bade him re member his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was In the moantime, the guardians and physiomen, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave the hlm. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasuro could hardly be concerned from those among whom he had gained this information. He bastened to the house of his former composition, arid, by constarit atteridance, and the presence of great affection for the mother and interest in his fate, he gradually wrote the ear of Misf Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils lo recount—eould speak of himself as of an individual having no sympalhy with any being on the crowdod earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;— could tell the bow, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her sootbing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the ferpent art, or such was the will of fclle, that  The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged stale ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servarils, but in vain. He asked a far pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, ori, which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought just betler not to harass any inore the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a romance. N might pass on without rest to the busy inmate of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of the marriage broke up his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost fraritic. The curiasity of the servants at last overeame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly old woman. He realized the opportunity, with the rope bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm the force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When I got the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered his ear —\"Remeinbor your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atteridants, who, raused by the old woman, had a comic in search of her. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a fluent, had hrokeri blood-vessel, and he was conveyed tohed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when I entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bride groom left London.\nAbbrey weakness increased; the effusion of blood praduced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he realized completely what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord R, then had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was also before him, where to choose his place of trust, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Soiling through the Grecjan Arcbipelago, the ori board one of his Majesty vessels, in the yeclr 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it — both men of war arid merchantmen; and though jl lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrno, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining sor cattle with the natlves, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. Ori the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a yaung Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days a previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said to Greck ,\" and would have taken me with a hirn; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good girl. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechinos for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his face very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excitedour curiosity very much, and we lost a lot of time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who canducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sittingling parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closel annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fauntain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches bymoving a spring flxed in the side of a small flxed Venus in a leaning posture; a large coueh or sofa completed thefumiture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchainber had merely a large maltr.\nless spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the ald man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamanschost in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileavs, and Rousfeclus works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed al Parina in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantiriople, mucb t o Most of these books were filled with marginol notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he isso particular, that were I to move the orie thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I one did him a service; and I have the product of this farm for trouble taking care of it, except twenty zeehines which I pay to an oged Armenian who resides in a small contract in the world, and wham the lord broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for whot reasori .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The price in front was flfty paces long and sourteen broad, arid the filled marble pil-\nlars with black plinths arid fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surranded by a lightstone haultrade, wascoverod by a fine cherry carpet, beneath an awning of a strong clear lincn. Most of the hovse-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christi\", eating frult, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we enlered the bouse, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its horders, and under the shade of two large meter bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placcd, on which we were told, lhe lord passed many of his ovenings and nights till twelve o'clock, rcading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said to be an old inan ,\"playing\" for him was verydevout ,\"and always atlended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this site was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mourit Calcla, covered with olive on myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruiris doscended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon vnshadowed by a single clovd, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and pcllm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observod, studding the light blue wave with spots of emercled green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic society: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candicl. \"The Armeriian,\" said our conductor ,\" could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare nat\". We had not time to visit the Armenjan, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of this isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one Indian, horses to others, arid cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Once the circumstance we learnt, which overland friends at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a pianoforte, and taught her himself this view of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing about this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genjus. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were solved. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a pvil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"aboul whom you are so anxiaus, if Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tericdos, and I also visited him at Milylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret riot having been more euriaus in our research at the cottage, but we cansoled ourselves with the disc of returning to Mitylene ori somc suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slatemenl, belleving is riot quite uninteresting, and in just a stice to his lordships good narne, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described.\nbed as of an unseeking disposition, clever to associalize with human nature, or contributing it any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer foelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, some lo have their seat in his bosom. Teriderness, sympathy, and charity appear to give allhis actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and ovor whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. Na man can record the preceding pleasing \"traits\" with-\nwithout feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do riots assume a right to give an opinion. Reporls are ever to be received with oaution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before the awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest tostimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-Port, Fleet-street.",

It appears, thal upon an examination of the coinmander-in-chief and magistrates of the plaoe, they posilively and unariimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had heard to say, thal, at Cassovia, on the srontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented hy a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth over the This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hiinself; for about twenty or thirty days after bif death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by hif attocks. To prevent further mischiof, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresb, and entirely free from corruplion, and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praof having been thus obtained, they resorted to accustomed romedy. A track was drivenentirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person fucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomantade is better related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations that any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a cl sort of punishment after dealing with, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrlse, but compelled to confine his infornal visitations solely lo lhose beings he loved inost while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of k indred and affcction .— A supposition alludod to in the \"Gia\nBut first on earth, os Vampyresent, Thy oorse shallsrom its tomb be rent; Then gha stly haunted tbe native placo, Arid suek the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain theftream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy ljvid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yct expire But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, shall choose thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame!

But this cannot be supposed to be resulted from the sinfulness of beer life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the talo as a cold complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonisbing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been on eyewitness; and Ccllmet, in his great work upon this subject, bcsides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionclry narralives illustralives of il effects, has put sorth saine learnod disserlations, tending to prove it to be a classical,\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible futperstition might be added; though the present may suffioe for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mercly remarking, that though the tcrm Vampyrc is the one in most general acceptance, there or several others synonymous with it, inade use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloko, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the most dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared in various us partics of the loaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance l0 pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weghed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished tosee him, and those who had been accustomed to violent ex-citement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong em olion of passion, though its forrn and oulline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, somc marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the But though the common adultress could not insluence even the guidance of his eyes, it was riot that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virluous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a writing tongue; and whether it was stable. it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moued by his apparent batred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the blast of their sex from their domestic virtues, asamong those who sully it by their vicos.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the naine of Aubrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left alsa to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty remained to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the cclro os mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination thon hjs judgmonl. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliries' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romance: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted of the vesting of clothes, which were as warin, but which were better adapted to the paintcrseye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Hc was handsome, frclnk, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many motherf surroved him, striving which should describe with leost truth, their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenanoef when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lod him into false notions of his talerits and bis merit. Attached as he was to the romanco of bis solitary hours, he started to find that, except in the lallow and wax eandles that flickered, not from the p resence of a ghost, but from warit snuffling, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of praising piclures and descriplions contained in those vol umes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to requiriquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above defcribed, crossed him in his order.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed iri bimself, who gave a few olber signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidarice of their contact: allowing bis imagination to pioture every lhing that flattered itf propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inla the hero of a romarice, and determined to observe the offspring of his He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his voice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining somc information rospecting this singular character, who, till naw, had only whetted this curiosity, he hinted to his guardions, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stepf in the career of vicc towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and riot allowing them toappear as if fallen from the skief, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasant They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join them. Flattcred by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, be gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the opposite molives to his conduct. His composition was profusc in his iberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortvnes attendant oven vpon virtue, that ho bestowed hls alms ;—these were sent from the doorwith hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lvst, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was an orie circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind, thase upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon il, because they were all either led to the seasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowrif thraugh which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eclgerness with which his companion sought for the centres of oll fashionable vicelethero heentered into all the spirit of the faro table: ho betted, and always gambled with successf, except where the knowri sharper was hjs antagonist, and the luckless falher of a numerous family; then his very wish secined fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, lorn from the circle to adomed, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate thal had drawn him within the reach of this fjerid; whilst many o father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet be took no money from the gambling table; bvt jmrnediately lost, to the river of rnany, lhe last gilder he had just snatched from the eonvulsiue grasp of the innocent: this might but bc the result of a certain dogree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating lhe cunning of the more expensive. Aubrey osten wishod to represent this to his friend, and bog him to reslgn thol charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his awn profit ;—but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his frierid would give hlm some appartunity of speaking frankly and operily to him; however, this never occurredred. Lord Ruthven ln his carriage, and amidst lhe various wild and rich scen\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the momorials of another almost deserted city. While he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eagcr impaticnce; the first was from bis sister, breathing nothing bvt affection; the others were srom his guordians, tbe lalter astonished him; if it had befare entered into his imagiriation that there was an civil power refident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the bellef. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, arid cried that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the passession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to erihance his gralification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtuo, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thot all those females whomhe had sougbt, apparently onaccount of their value, bad, since his departure, thrown even lhe\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not just shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to prevent some plausible pretext for abandoriing him altogether, purpofing, in the mecln while, to watch bim more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whosc house he chlefly frequented. In Italy, it ls soldom that an unmarried female is met with in soclety; hc was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubroy's cye followed bim in all his windings, and soon discove red that an clssigna lion had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocerit, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his interitions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her laughter. Lord Steven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remaining order of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthvon next day morely sent his servant to notify hiscomplete assent to separation; but did not have any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rorne, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, the saon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon oceupied himself in lracing the faded recards of aneient glory upon manuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden theinselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured llchen. Under the same roof as himself, excited being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model sor o paintor wishing to pourlray on canvas, to promised the hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think she could beloring those who had no souls. As she daneed upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanging her eye, apparently the eye of an animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the tasle of an epicure. The light step of Iarithe osten accompanied Aubrey in this search after antiquities, arid oftcn would uneonscious girl, engagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere hutterfly, sbow the whole beauty of her form,sloalirig as itwere upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost esfaced tablet, in the contemplation of her syl Often would her tresses falling, as some flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray sucb delicately brilliant and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the aritiquary, who let cscape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Paufan-\nthe idea. Bul why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innoccnce, youth, and beauty,unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms arid stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for hls fulure hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, intracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hjm the eircling dance upon lhe open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colour of youthful memory, the morriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irifancy; arid then, turning to subjects that had evidently Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narroted, excited the iriterest even of Aubrey; and often os she told him the lale of thc living vampyre, who had passed years amldst his friends, and dearlble fantasies; but Ianthe cited him the lale of thc living vampyre, who had passed years amldst his friends, and dearlble fantasies; sorced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely f She detailed him the traditional appearance of those monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthuen; he, bowcver, still pcrsifled in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered al the many coincidences which had only lended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her lnnocerice, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman omong whom he bad fougbt for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself all the time from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquaricln research, would depart, determined not to return until his object was attached; but he always found it impossible to six his attention upon the ruins around hirn, but he must ln his mind horetained an image that somemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyref, and they both, with a secret present, affirming their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at right, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the dayhad closed, upon any consideration. They described it called the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dored to cross their path. Aub really made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he sclw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a fuperjor, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was able to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eamestly bcgged him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be pulled in action ;— he promised. He was, however, also occupied in his research, that he did not per-\nceive that d ay-light would soon end, and that iri the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warrner climates, so rapidly gather into a tremeridous mass, and pour all their rage upon the dovoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immedjately the sun sets, nighl beginf: and he had a bad advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its eohoing thunders had scarcely aninterval or rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightniring seemed to foll and radiate of his very feet. Suddenly, this horse took fright, and he was earried with a dreadsul rapldity through the entangled forest. The animal of the last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel light hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead Ieaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismovriting, he approached, hoping to find someone to give him to the tawn, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with this stifled, exu-\na constant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;— he was startled: hut, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: he said, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contacl with some one, whomheimmediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whoso strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he waf lifted from his feel and hurled with enormous for ce against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed The form was still now; and Aubroy, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered the light of their tarches fell upon the mud walls, and the thalch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrcy they searched for her who hadattracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnore burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a Iifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was built a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when uriclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colover upon her check, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stlllnoss about her face that seemed cllmost af attaching as the lifc that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and broast waf hlood, cland upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! Compare !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side as her wife had already been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now scolded with the flower of life that had died within a ber. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemed to find reflection, and take refuge in vaconcy — he held almost unc conciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which had been found in this hut. They wore soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of the stone drawful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertclined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to the course. They were inconsoble; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was osten deliriovs; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to bcg of bls former companion to spare time being he Ioved. At other times, he would imprecate the millions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, danced at this time to arrive at Athcns, and, from whatever movement, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant atlendant. When the latter recovered from bis delirium, he was horrlflod and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by this kind of words, irnplying olmost repentance for the sault that bad causod their separation, and still more by the cltt ention, anxiously, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that clpathetic being who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state ofmind, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that clt times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of molicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last fate of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs,circling, like our world, the movelefs sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was much weakened, and that the equality of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but muoh as hc wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the neigbbovrhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the neigbbovrhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the neigbbovrhood of Athens, her light step would appear wandering amidst the under He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter ossociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender carc he had taken of bim during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollections could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed only to heed what they gazed upon. They ard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the inverition of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of this neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipices, they had reasori to repent their intelligence; so scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narraw pafs, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In the instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sbetcring turn of the defile: but ashamed af being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts badc them advanced, and being exposed to uriresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb obove arid take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush farward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot on the shoulder, which brought him. lo the ground d. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer boeding the conlest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrondered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon introduced them to convey his woundedfriend to a neighboring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being conlent merely to guard the entranco till their comrade should return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the mortification ensued, and death seemed to be advancing with hasty steps. Hisconduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed to be unconscious of pain class. he had been of those objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you must save me — you may do more than that — I mean riot my life. I need the death of many existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\"Replaced Aubrey .—\"I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, many honours were free from stain in the world rnoulh — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swecler !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crirnes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; he many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentimenl of something horrible awaiting him. Rifirig early in the morning, he was able to eriter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robbor met blm, and informed him that it was no longer there, havirigbeen conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a ringbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after bif death. Aubrey astoriished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he bad pronounced to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the olothes, though the robbers sw or they pointed out the identical rockon which they had laid the body. For the cold time, his mind was bewllered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burned the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had a mot with sueb terrible misforturies, and in which a half apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious meancholy that had seized upon his mind, hc resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he held with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers around the attacks. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at firiding a fheath apparently omarnentod in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falal hut—be shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that lt fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the partieular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sbeath were alike in splendour on the botb, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sm yrna, and on his way home, of Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady who had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune, ruinod, and she had not been heard of since the deporture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation considered urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to teach English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embr aces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she beforeed her infanline caresses, the blood gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had nol that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brillicency which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the ring beneath. There was a melanch only charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her hro-\nthey breathed at her his affection, and would in her prefence forget those griefs and knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the hell of the volupluclry? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the face were then playing in the light of their own nalive sphere. She was yet orily eightcen, and had not been presented to the world, it had been thought by her guardianf more fit than her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the content, when he might beher proteotor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather bave rernained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of foshionable strangers, when his mind had been fo lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive —adrawing-room had not been held for a long lime, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: A ubrey was there with his sister. While he was stariding in a corrier hy himself, beedlefs of all around him, erigaged in the remombrance that the first time he had been Lord Ruthuen was iri that very place — he felt himself suddenly feized by the clrm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remernber your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spocket that would blast him, where he proved, at a little distance, the same figure which bad attracted hif noticed on this spot upon his first entry into society. He ga zed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into a carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven agoin before him—circumstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !—Ho thought his imagination had conjured up lhe image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into socioty; for lhough he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung up on his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsels up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, and his sister surrounded by several, apparently in the eamest convorsation; he attempted to pass arid get near her, when ane, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to help those features he mast abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with burried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oat-\nh !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was just engrossed, now that the country of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrvant conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his bre-\nthat, amidst all, he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicians, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to force the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this station; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, a river longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight domps. He was no loriger to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook the train. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by a hirn who fled from a pursuer swifter than only — from thought. His can duct, however, just suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he felt by his absence lhe wholo of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of those presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a roorn, hahaggard and suspicious looks wore so striking, his inward shudderings were visible, that his sister was at last obliged to bog of him to abstairi from soeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interfere, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a big time to resumo ogain that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, a clnd of preventing him from exposing to the general eye thase marks of what they corisidered slowly, they engaged a politician to reside in the house, and take the correctant core of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbod by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for a day, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had ottained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign ofaffection and recollections remaining displayed itself upon the eritry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" Where, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True !\" and again, she sank into a state, when she didn't even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and half mind threw off cl portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times ln the day would count upon bjs fingers a definlte number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardlans entering his room, begari to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstances of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Grad of this mark of returning intcllect, of which they feared he had been involved, they mentioned the riarno of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by expressing his intention to be presenting the nuptials, and desiring to some of his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressedher to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of afseotlon. He began to speak with all his wonted warinth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise as beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He sejzed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—tben seizing her hands, and gazing on beer with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could nol advance — it seemed as if that voice again bado him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord. Ruthven will near him, but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, described her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributed this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of a high mind, believed to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-rooin, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concelled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former company, and, byconstant atteridanee, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually waned the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover—could speak af himsels as of an individual having no syinpathy with ony being on the crowded earth, savc with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that The title of the elder branch falling at length to hlm, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for addressing marriage ,( in spite of the ber brothers deranged state ,) which was to take place every day before hif deporture for the content.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the funerals, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; just was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, she valued her owri happiness, her own hanour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who ance held her ln their arins as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay bvt for a few bours battle, on which he denounced the most heavy curscs. The servants pramised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass one more the mind of Misf Aubreyby, what he considered, the lives of a maniac. Night passed on without rest at the busy lnmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily be onceived than described, the notes of a busy preparation. Morning come, and the sound ofcarriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at laft overcrearne their voice, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the study of a belpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with once bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by soree, hurried bim from the room, speechless with a circle. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear — \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonourod. Women are scared !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessels, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effiction of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. Hedesirod his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he said immediately after.\nThe guardianshasteried to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was a loo late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND DF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE.\n\"The world was all before hirn, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we putinto the harbour ofMitylene, iri the island of that narne. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there,induoe many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and inorcbantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply pray for the devialion of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purscr bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mo native so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had become from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our original in bls felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" the cold would have taken a rne with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The eottage over the hlll, facing the ri ver, beings to him, arid he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trclder, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), arid has refided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very osten to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floar — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a lar ge myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning poslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts arid a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seainan chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaircs, Shakspeclres, Boileaus, and Rousfeau works complete; VoIney Rulns of EmpireslZmmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 181 O; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with the slips of paper, which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before being scalled, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must live until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him call service; and I have to produce this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the hand used externally was playing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pilars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in the German architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Grceks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, os we entered the house, a small streamlct glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shape of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which were lold, the lord passed many of his evenings and night till twelvc clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this soat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and inyrtle trees in blaom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascodes, until it was last in the woods near the mountains base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizori unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view iri front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chests and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom noticed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who bad resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. e :\" The Arme-\nnian,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not.\" We had a time to visit the Armenian, bvl on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of being isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to a nice man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to those girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a village, and he often gave Greek Testaments to their poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolentchcler. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daugb after, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had boughl hera piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the road, guessling who this rainblerin Greece could be. He had money just was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, if Lord Byron, I met him on my travels on the island of Tenodos, and I also visited him at Mitylcne .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chied Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the stage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships, a good crime, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as only be plairily gathered from these little anecdotes. I have finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicled in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatby, and Charily appeclr to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for rnarking hirn as a being on whose heart religion hath sct her seal, and ouer whose hecld Benevolcnce hatbthrown her mant le. No man can read the preceding pleafing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before the awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. To do goad in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving c conscience.\nTHE END!\nct: Gillet, Printer, Crown-court, Flcet-sleet.",
    "24": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Arnong thc Arabians it appears to be common: it did nol, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Cbristianity; clt which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin badly could not corrupt is buried in their territory, it gradually increased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stars, still extant, of the dead ris ing from their graves, and foeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, on Lorraine, where the beief existed, that vampyres nig htly imbied a certainclination of the blood of their uictims, who beoarne emaciated, lost their strength, and specdily died os consumptions; whilst tbese human blood-suckers fattened—and lhelr veins became distended to such a state\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a serious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unconsciously affirmed that, about five years before.\nre, a certain Heyduke, nained Arnold Paul, had beeri heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the froritiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyro himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four perfons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants baviring consulted their Hcldagni, took up tho body, cldagni, took up tho b0dy, clnd sound it (as is supposed to be usual in casos of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free srom corruption, arid emitting at the movth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and the body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his bead, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the carses of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal helies are, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other institute which could be adduced. In any parts of Greece it is considered as a sorl of punishment after death, sor some heirious crime committed which in existence, that the deceosed is riot only doomed to uampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visltations solely to those beings he loved most while upan earth—those to whom he was bound hy ties of klndred arid affeelion .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Gia\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suok the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Mvst feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thus cursing them But one that for the crime mustfall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless the with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame!

Yet with thine owri best bload shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in harror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire curse of the Arabion maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormonting him best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The vcracious Tour nefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his groat work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible futperstition might be added; though this present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general aeceplation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of lho dissipationf atlendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those wbo felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whioh, slxing upon the objocts face, did not seem to penetrate, and al arie glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; bvt fell upon the check with a lcaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His poculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accuslomod to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly huo of his face, which never gained a warmer than, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though ilf form and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntors after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mo ckery of every monstershewn in drclwing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the uirtuous wife and innocent daughter, that sew knew he had ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that will even overcome. the dread of his singular character, or that they wore moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was asoften among those female males who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, or among lhosc who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister, ln the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while being was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the inore important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hone, that high romaritic feeling of honour and courage, which daily ruins so many million apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence morely for the plctvresqueeffect of the scenc, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a oottage merely consisted of the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, in the final, that the dreams of the police were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least the truth lheir langvishing or rompiring favourjles: the doughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into f also notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romarice of his solitary hours, he started at sinding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles thal flickered, not from the presence of a ghoft, but from the want of sneffing, there was no soundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those values, from which he had sormod his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary body we have above described, crofsed him into his career.\nHe watched him; and lhe very impossibllity of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himsclf, who gave a few other signs of his observation of cxternal obiecls, than the tacjt assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flatlered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inlo lhe hero of a romarice, and determined to He became acquainled with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Stevens officers were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous0s gaining some information respeeting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetled his cvriosity, he hinted to his guordians, that il was time for bim to perform the tovr, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them toappear as if fallen from the skies, whenevor scandalous inlrigues are mentioned as lhe\nrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, wossurprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a lack of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other minds, be gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity to study Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of hisactions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent molives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idlo, the vagabond, and the boggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was riot upon the virtuous, reduced to indigcence by the misfortunes atlendant even upon virtue, that he bestowod his alms ;—these were sont from the door which hardly suppressed sne ers; but when the profligate caine to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wollow in his Iust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was This was, however, tributed byhim to the greater importance of being vicious, which generally prevails over the cutting bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whomit was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misory. At Brussels and other towns through wb which lhey passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eclgerness with wbich his company sought for the centres of all fashjonable vice; lhehe entered into all the spirit of lhe faro table: be betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then was lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was In every town, he left the formery affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorried, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, thefate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a fathor sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hurigry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufsicierit to satisfy their prescrit craving. Yet take rio money from the gambling table; but immediately Iost, to the ruincrof many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of theinnocent: this rnight but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg hiin to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his own profit; he delayed il—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than hislip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constarit excitement of vainly waiting to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he wrote in search of the inemorials of another almost deserled cily. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from hifsister, breathing nothing hut clffection; the others were from bis guardians, the latter astonifhed him; if it had before entered into bis imagination that there was an euil power resident in his companion, th ese seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belies. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious babits into dangerous society. It bad became discovered that his contempt for tbe adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to erihance his gratification, that bis vietim, tbe partner ofhis guilt, should he hurled from the plnnocle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had fought, apparently on account of their virlue, had, since his departure, then even \nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent somo plclusible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meon while, to watch him more closely, and that let no slight circumftances pass byunnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endearing to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would mast likely end in the ruin of aninnocent, though thoughtless gir. 1. Losing no time. , he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lody, insorming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to ineet her that very night. LordRuthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such a ari accasion; and upon being pressed whether he was tempted to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey, retir-\ned; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must decide accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his seruanl to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all hernew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of bis Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthuen next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninfula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimsclf in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monumcnts that apparently, ashamed of chronicling tbe deeds of freemon only bosore sloves, had hidden themselves beneclth the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof class himself, existod being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on carivass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes for too much mirid for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eyc of animatod nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanicd Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncons cious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eag er gaze of him, who forgot the letters hehad just decyphored upon an almost effacod lablet, in the expectation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her stress falling, clshe flitted around, exhib it in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the tbe clntiquary, who let escape from his mind the very abiect he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a pafsage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those romains of which wished to prescrve a memoriol sor his future hours, she would stand by, arid watch the magie effecls of his penciI, in tracing lhe scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the operi plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; arid theri, lurning to Her earnestness and apparent bolief of what she riarrated, exoited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, foreed every year, by foeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attributed to him to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited him She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered that many coincidences which had all tended to exoite a hell in the supernative power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to clttaohhimself more and more lo Iclnthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of a Romanoe, wori his heart; and while being ridiculod by the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to that almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, but he relained a clean image that seemed alone which was the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and will ever be the same frank infantilc being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupicd in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several prefects, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very moment. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must receirly pass through a wood, where no Greek would cver remain, clfter the day had elofed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the uampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impendiring upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNothing Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief of those borrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to dopart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be pulled in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that iri thc horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted coun try .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost uriknawn; immediately the sun sets, nigbl begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forward lighting seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hospital that hardly listed himself vp from the masses of dead leclves and brushwood which surrounds it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, thelhunderf, for a moment silenl, allowed him toheor the dreadfulshrieks of a woman mirigling with a stifled, exulant mockery of a laugh, coritinued in one almost uribroken sound ;—he was slartled: but, rovsed by tho thundcr which again rolled over bis head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He sounds himself in touch darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, wham he immediately feized; when a voice cried ,\"Agairi baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he fell himself grappled by one whose throclt—when the glare of many torchcs penotrating through the hole that gave light ln the day, disturbed him ;—he iristantly rose, and, leoving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crasb The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They enter the d; the light of their torches fellupon to mud wallf, and then thatch loaded on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was againleft in darkness; but what was his horrar, when the light of the torches once more b hurt upon bim, to peroeive the airy form of his fair canductress braught in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same sorm, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her fcloe that scemed almost as attacking as the life that once dwolt thore :—upon ber neck and breast was blood, and upori her throat were the marks of leeth having opened this vein :— to this the meri pointed, crying, simullaneously ftruck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had almost been to him. the object of so many bright and f airy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind wasbenumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and take force in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were some metby different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To decide if their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died, brokenhearted.\nAubrey boiring put lo bed was seized with a moft vlolent fever, and was often delirious; ln these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some vnaccountable coinbination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare time being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him on her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from the whaler's motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and stclrtled at the sight of him whose image he had riow ombbined with that of a Vampyre; bul Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still inore by the attention, arixiety, and core which he showed, soon concluded him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apclthetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but cls s0on as hjf convalesconce began to be rapid, he again gradually retired to the same stote of mind, and Aubrey percelved rio different from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his game fixed intently upon him, with a smile of maliciovs exutation playing upon his During the last stage of the individual recovery, Lord Steven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of lhose orbs, clrcling, like our world, the moveless svn ;— Indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find Jt jn tho neighbourhood of Athons; if he sought it in the woods, her Iight step would appeclr wondering almost theunderwood, in quest of thc inode st violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, hor pale face and wounded lhroot, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, that whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They traveled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attoched: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to exoite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretending the dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a deferiee. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, withlarge masses of rock brought down from neighbourling prec ipices, they held the reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pclss, when they were ftartled by tbe whistling of bullets class to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. Instont, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun tosire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Auhrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the lho sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus dctained by a foe, who with lnsvlting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresistling slavghter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined al once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Clearly bad theylost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfislance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was so surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Heaven being waunded, immediately thrown up their arms arid surrendered.\nBypromises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cclbin; clnd having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content nearly to guard the entrance till their comrade sbould return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the morlificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty facts. Hif conduct and appearance bcld nol changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain af had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye osten fjxed upon Avbrey, who was indvced lo of for his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need a hot little — my life obbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world rought — and is my death very unknown for some time in England —I —I — but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried thedying man, ralsing himself with extant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature sears, swear that, for a cold year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my dear mind or death to any living being in any way, whaleuer may happen, or whalever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursling from their sockets :\" I swear !\" the child's number-\nthey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many acquaintances attending his acquaintarice with this man rose upori his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath acold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible clwailing him. Rjsing early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left lho corpse, when a robber met him, arid informed hlm that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and cornrades, upon his retirement, that the pinnacle of a neighbouring movement, according to the cl prornise they bad given his lordship, that will be exposed to the first cold ray of the rnoon that rose after his death Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of eltber the corpso or the clothes, though the robbers swore they polled out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conje culture, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burned the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWoary of a country in which he had mel with such terrible missortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Sinyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adap tried to ensure the death of the victim. There were several challenges and attacks. Whilst turning them over, and oxamining their curious forms, whal was a surprise at finding a sbeath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discouered in the fat al hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror rnay bc imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in hif hand. His eyes seemed to need rio further certainty — they seemed to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the peculiar form, the same varying tinls upori the haft and sheath were alike in the splendour ori botb, and left rio room for doubt; there were also drops of blood ori each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, clt Rome, hls first inquiries were concerning the lady, he badly attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distross, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of this lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone who had a child dear. He arrived at Calais; a breezc, which seemed obedlent to hif will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hasteriod to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If such before, by her infantine caresses, he gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey is bad not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists from the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind heneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicale a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a utterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother hathed to hear his affection, arid would in her presence forget those gifts. she knew deftroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been preserited to the world, it has been taught by hcr guclr dianf more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continerit, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the noxl drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scenc\". Aubrey would read there have remained in the translation of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. Ho could only feel interested in the frivolities of fashionablo strangers, when he had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; bvt he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was expensive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened together. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembranoe that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthveri was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seizod by the arm, and a voice he recognized tao well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardy courage to turn, fearful of seeing a cl spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted hif notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to become their weight.\nht, he was obliged to take the form of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rulhven agairi beforehim—ccumstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .—He rouscd himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his i imagination had conurcd up theimoge his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask conceming Lord Ruthven, the name bung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recefs, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that money were lcaving, he roused bimself, and oritoring another room, found his sister svroved by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near ber, when once, whom requested to move, turned round, and revcaled to him, those features he mast abhorred. He sprang forward, said his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, foroed her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not decide to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thought. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what he caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and that terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His aath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all being held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to force the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. Four days he remainod in this state; shut up in his room, he sow no one, and ate only when bjs sister came, who, with eyes ftreaming with tears, besought bim, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of becoming stillness and solited, he lost his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became relucted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him to fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were uncanscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, rernonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Avbrey parerits.\nDesirous of saving hiin from the injurics and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in the house, and take correctant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became in the last so great that he was confused by his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and collection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sisler; then he would sometimes start, and, seeing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do nol touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he answered, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" the order again he sank into a state, whonce only even if she could prove him. This Iasted many months: gradually, hawever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon hif fingers a definite number, and then srnil e.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians eritering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Iristantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked unxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returnjrig interlect, os which they formed, he had been depressed, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in the following minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his heart, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockot upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon hor asking him why he thus destroyed the refemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember bis oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implorod, he hegged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the instantly they imagined, had a token possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rulhven had called the moming after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he hoard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed jnsane, his exvltation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist the big power? His tonguo had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an iridividual having no sympathy with anyone being ori the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himsels ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents ;—iri fine, he kriew so well how to use lho serpent art, or The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her mother's deranged state ,) which was also a place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physicion and his guardians, was altempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrolea letter to his sister, eonjring her, os she valued her own bcpinoss, her own honaur, and the honour of lhose now in the grave, who anyone held her in their arms as their hope and the bope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most beavy curses. Tbe servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that many more easily be conceived than described, the note of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of the carriage broke upon the bis ear. ct: Audrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcarne lheir vigilarice, they gradually stole away, leaving him inthc custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in the cold moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from theroam, speechless with rag e. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your aath, and know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his alternatives, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessels, and he was convoyed to bed. This was not attributed to his sister, who was not present when I entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood provided symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sifcher had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT DF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCDUNT OF LORD BYRENS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world will all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence life guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grccian Archipelago, on board one of his Mcljesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put irito the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce mariy British ves sels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather over the track sor ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay farthe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the rnen were emplayed in waterling, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nalives, the clergymari and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (cl fmall monticule so narned) we met with and engaged a young group as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island saur days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He changed me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mltylene, where I came likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and he resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails into his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no lime in hastening to the haufo where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—on the entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were clll simplydecorated: plain grecn-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small souritain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venvs in a leaning pasture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood at hals a dazeri English chair, and an empty book-casc: there were no mirrors, nor a single pairiting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed colton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, fortunately, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but. we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseou's warks complete; Volney's Ruins of Empjres; Zimmermori, in the G erman language; K1opstock's Messiah; Kotzebues noves; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Parcldise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a cell pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribhled all over, and walked with slips of paper, which also were romarks.\nThe ald man said :\"The lord had been recording these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot that place came with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the procedure of this farm for the trouble of king care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reasori .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and forth broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black piths and fret-work carnices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone halustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish company, beneath anawning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma Christian\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large mature bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was plaoed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devovl ,\"arid always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what he terined \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covered with olive and myrlle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain baso. The sea srnooth as glass, and an horizori unshadowed by a single cloud, lerminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty cbesnut and pamlrees, several srnall islands woro distinotlyobserved, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless asto the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our coriductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannol you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borrows to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from the call we collected, to have beeno very eccentric and beautiful character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the bottle thought proper not to disclose. Hehad a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seeking walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which wedeparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philosophy of dispositiori, and all those eocontricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"Tbe individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordships farne, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe College\" being pulled into over hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more serious in our research into the cottage, but we corisoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on the sorno future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement believing it is not quite unintcresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slaridered. He has been described as an unseeling disposition, averse to ossociating with human nature, or contributing in any way to some its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as only be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderncss, syinpathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his co urting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a boing on whose heart Religiori hath set her seol, and over whose hoad Berievolence hath thrown her rantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not become a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly where directed against man moral integrity; and he who daref justify himself before that awful tribunal before all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-martal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of this genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world of place, is the svrest testimony of a vigorous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "25": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John Williain Polidori.\nTHE support section which this place is founded is very general in the class. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itsels to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; and it has only assumed its present forrn since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalenl, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. In the West it spread, with some slight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austrio, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly jmbibed a cerlain porlion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strerigth, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suokers fattened—and their veins hecame distended to such a state of repletian, as lo cavse the blood\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March ,732, is o curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular ease of vampyrism, which is slaled to have occurred at Mcldreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon the cln examinalion of the commander-in-chief and rnagiflrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certairi Hcyduke, riamed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia,on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating somo of the earth This precaution, however, could not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormerited by hiin, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inbabitants having consulted their Hadagni, toak up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proos having been thus obtained, they resorted to be contacted today. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This dance, they cut off his head, hurned his body, and threw the glasses into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, Iest they should, iri, their turri, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a clumber becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis moristrouf rodomontade is hero related, because it seems better adapted to illustrato the subject of the present observations that any other instance which could be reduced. Iri many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishment after death, for some heirious erime committed whilst in existence, thal the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his international visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon cclrth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affeclion .— A suppofition alluded to in the \"Giclour\".\nBut first on earth, as a vampire sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At rnidnight drain tho slream of life; Yet loathe thc banquet which perforce Must feed thy living corfe, Thy victims, they yet expire, Sball know tho deinon for their sire; As cursing thoe, t The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thec with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet lbou must on the task and mark Her cboek's last tinge—her eye's last tinge, And the last glassy glclnce must view which sreezes over its lifeless blue; Then withunhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her ycllow hair. Of which, in life a lock when sborn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is broken away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and hclggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls andAfrils rave, Till these in horror shririk away from speclre inore accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre oorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she felt loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his greal work upon this subject, besides a vari ety of anecdotos, and traditionary narralives illuslrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertclations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarjan error.\nMariy curious and interesting notiees on this singularly borrilo fuperstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limit of a note, neessarjly devoted to explanaljan, clnd which may now be concluded hy merely remarking, that though the termVampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIT happeriod that in the inidst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nableman, more remarkable for his singularities, than hif rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laugbtor of the fair only attracted the situation, that he might be a look quell, and throw fear into those breasls where thoughtlessness reigned. Thofe who felt this affection of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deod grey cye, which, fixing upon the object of ace, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pick up the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a lea den rcly that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused bim to be invited to every house; all wished to sec him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were plcased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. Iri spite of the doodly hueof his face, which never goined a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beauliful, mariy of the female hunlers after notoriety altempled to win his attentions, arid gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been a mockery of the female hunlers after notoriety, he remained in his attention But though the cammon adullress could not influence even the guldance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, thal few knew he had addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; found whether it was that just even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by this apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, cls among those who usually it by theirvices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in the profession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his ring to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed al 1 to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown jri by Providence merely for the pictures of ef effect of the scene, as we see in rornances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in tbe vesting of clotbes, which were warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various ooloured patches. He thought, in the figure, that the dreams of the poet were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, inany mothers surrounding him, striving which should describe with least truth, their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters of the same time, their brlghtoning countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merlt. Attached as he was to the romance of his salitary hours, he was slartled at finding, lhat, except in tbc talk and wax candlcs that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no fouridation in real lifo for any of those congeries, splesing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have abovedescribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, impliod by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that fatrod lts propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forined his object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before  He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining from information respocting this singular character, wh0, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardions, that il was time for him to perfarm the tour, which for many generations has been lought nocessary to enahle the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if selling from the skies, whenever scondalous irilrigues are mentioned They corrected: and Aubrey immediately inentianing his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, thal, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to help conduct. His composition was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could not avoid romarking, that it was notupon the virtuous, reducod to lndigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon uirtuc, that he beslowed hjs alms ;—these were scnt from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were also either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most difficult misery. At Brussels and otherlowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerries with which his companiori sought for the oentres of all foshionable vice; there he entered irito all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gombled with success, except where tbe known sharper was hls ontagonist, and then he lost cven more than he gained; but it was always with the same uncbanging face, with which he generally In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorried, cursing, in the foljtude of cl dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst inany a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his latc immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their preferit craving. Yot he took no money from the garnbling label; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the inriocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubroy often wished to represent this to his friend, and bog him to resign thal charjly and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he who ped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frarikly and openly to hiin; however, this never occurred. Lord Rulhven in his carriage, and amidst these various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spake Iess than his lip; and though Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, ho ohtainod no greater gratification from it thari the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his oxalted imagjnaliori began to asfume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of this companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memoriclls of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lelters orrived from England, which he operied with eager impatience; the first was srorn his sisler, breathing riothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter ostonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagination that there was an evil power resident in hif eompanion, these seemed to give bim sufflciont reasori for the belief. His guardians insisled upon his immediately leaving his friend, clnd urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible power of sedvction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that bis contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to en hance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of hjs guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsvllied virtvo, down to the lowest abyss of infomy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on occount of their virtue, had, since bis departure, thrown even tb\nAubroy determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a light bright point on which to reft the eye. He resolved to inventsome possible prelext for abandoning bim altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and also let no flight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He went.\nhe ered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with iri society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plclns in secret; bul Auhrey's eye followed him in all his hands, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointod, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though a thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, arid abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very right. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an accasion; and upon being pressed whether he was tempted to marry beer, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of the ir proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other opartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of the oll hc knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was presented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not find any selection of his plans by ving heen foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenf. He lhen fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monvments that apparently, asbamed os chronicling tbe deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves bneath tbe sheltering sojl or rnany coloured ljehen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wisbing to pourtray on canvoss the promised shape of the faithful in Mahomets poradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind sor any one to think she could blow to those who hold no souls. As she danced upontbe plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchariged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited bul to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompclnied Aubrey in his search clfter antiquitjes, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of aKashmere 6uttersly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the Ietters had just dccypbered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofton would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who letescape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It wcls innoccnce, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-roads and stifling balls. Wbilst he drew those rcmains os which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future bours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in traoing the scenes of her native ploce; sbe would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours as youthful rnemory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her lnfancy; and then, tuming to svbject Her earneslnesf and apparent bellef of what she narrated, excited the interest euen of A ubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vclmpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the lise of a lie of a lovely flange to prolong his existence for thc ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, arid his borror was incrcased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthuon; he, h owever, still persisted iri persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many caincidences which had also tended to excite a belief in the supornatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocenco, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hif heclrt; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habit, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some clntiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his abject was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind heretained an image that seemed alone lhe rightful possessor of his thoughts. Iantho was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank information when he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, but her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, played with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his calculations, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to return at night, as he must neocssarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day bad closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him whodcled to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy force of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, making the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his refeorch, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that ln the horoon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to wake up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fets, night begins: and he had advoncod far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an irilervad of re st—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate al his vory feet. Suddenly, his brother looked fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the enlarigled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the ridgebourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and hrushwood which furrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the law, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storrn. As he approached, the thunders, for a momcrit silent, clllowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mookery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, soroed open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and the radio noise was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a uoice eried ,\"Again bafsled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and felt himself grapped by orie whoso strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but just was in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled with enormous force ogainst the ground :—his enemy throws himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed The slorm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soor heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded ori every individual straw with beavy flakos of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attract him by her cries; he was agairi left in darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torchos once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his four conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw thesamo sorin, when he closed them, stretched by his side. There was nocolour upon her check, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacking as the life that once dwelt there :—vpon her neckand breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying,simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had already been to him the object of so many bright and f airy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died without her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They wore soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lame native cars, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of somo dreadful eatastrophe. — To describe this grief would be impossible; but when they asoertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey boing put to bed was seized with a mast violent fever, and wos often devirious; in these intervals hc would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iclnthc—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. Al the other times, who would imprecate the millions upon his head, and curse him as a beer destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chariced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, arid because he was a constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his dolirium, he was horrified and startled clt the sight of him whoso image he had now combined with the heart of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost a tendency for the fault that had cculsed their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite c hanged; he no longer appeared that apathelio being wbo had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapld, he again gradually retired inta the same state of mind, and avrroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that al times he was surprised to moet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exvltation playing upon his lips: he knew not wby, During the last stage of the invalid reeavery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which was bad once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitvdo and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, bis mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wondering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violot; then suddenly turning round, would show, to bis wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter situations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, that whom he held himsels bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece either had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They beard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from prone dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large massos of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scareely were the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, bad began to first in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turri of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts bade thom advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, ifany of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in the scarch of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastonedto his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendcred.\nBy promise of great reward, Aubrey sooninduoed them to convince his waunded friend to a reighbouring eabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their presence—they being coritent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty state ps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eyes often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer help assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I hope the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you inaysaue my honor, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me bowlI would do anything,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need a little tiny lise ebbsapaoe — I cannot explain all you know of me, my bonour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\" It's a hall not known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rclifing himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul recovers, by all your nature fears, swear thal, sor a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being iri any way, whether it may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; like many circumstances.\nces attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold sbivering camo over him, as is from the presentment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which hehad left the carpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been convinced by himself and comrades, upon his rotiring, to the pinnacle of a ncigbbouring mount, according to a promise they had given hislordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avbrey aftonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bring it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore thoy poinled out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was hewildered in conjectures, but he at least returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the score of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had melled with such terrible misfortunes, and in which allapparently oonspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convoy him to Otranto, ar to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongsl other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamenled in the same style as lhe daggcd—haslening to gain the father praof, he found this weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, lough peculiarly shaped, the shath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; both the particular form, the same varying tintsvon the haft and s heath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room far doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on his way home, at Rome, if first inquiries were concerning the lady, he had attempted to snatch from Lord Stevens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of the sincere departure of his lordship. Avbrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. Hebecame morose and silent; clnd his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the monsion of his sathers, and thero, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of this sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning the grade which gains the gaze and appreciation of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of the tall light brilliancy which originally exists in the heated atmosphere of a cold crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misorturie, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul consoious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which st rays where a buttersly or a colour mcly a ttract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlenod by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her hisaffectian, and would ln her presence forget those girls she kriew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that factor was then playing in the light of their own native speaker. She was yet only eightoen, arid had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians' moro fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should both the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the rainnation of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangors, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-rooin had not been held for a long time, and also who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hasteried thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Rernember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when being perccived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracts bis notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gave his mind almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, threw himself into hiscarriage, and was driving home. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthuen agairi before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oatb .— He roused himself, be could not believe it possibly — the dead rife again !— He thought his imagination had coniured up the iinage his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into socioly; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the atmosphere of a near relationship. Leaving her undor the protection of a motron, he returned into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another roorn, saund his sister surrounded by several, apparently in the eornest conversation; he was tempted to pass and get near hor, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurriedstep, forced her toward the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he waf engaged in passing thein, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distractod. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in fact that she interested him to explain to her which had caused his abrupt conduct. He only wrote a few words, and he terrified her. The more he thought, the more he waswildered. His oath started him ;— away. he then to follow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, against all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his path, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own harid to free the world from such a wretch; buldeath, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he scold no one, and ate only when his sister came to tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness arid spirit, he left his house, raamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which hailed him. His dress became becamonegleoted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; bvt al last he laid bim down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow the bill; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abscnce the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter agairi into society, and watch him closely, anxious to farewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached with iritimacy. But where he entered into a roam, his haggard and suspicjous loo ks were so slriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was also last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affocted him so strangly. Wheri, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper lo interpofe, and, feclring that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirovs of saving him from the injuries and sufferings, he had daily encourited in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the genoral eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physiciari to refide in the house, and take constant care of him. Hehcoldly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, though he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attacked a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the eritry of his sisler; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted beer, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Ob, do not touch him —is your love for me aught, do not go near the bim !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, when not ever she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequerit, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst bis guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Auhreys being into an awful situation, where his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to w him. Glad of this mark of roturning intelligently, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in sew minutes if the sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely family; for hepressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being more alive to the feelings of afsection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate ber upon her marriage with a person so dislinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at the beginning of the f eatures of the monstro who had so lang influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus deslroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing onher with a frantic expression of countericlrice, he had her swear that sbo would never wed this monster, sor he — But he could not advance — it scemed as if that voice agairi bade bim remember his oath — be turned suddenly around, thinkingLord Ruthven was near hlm but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had beard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disordor, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrcy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to lhem, he implored, he bogged them to delay, but for one day. They, putting this into the insanity they imagined had taken pos-\nThe session of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys illhealth, he really understood himself to be this cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, hisexultation and pleasure could barely be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother arid interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speclk of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;— could tell how, sinco he knew hor, his existence, hcld bcgun ta secm worthy of preservation. If it were interesting that he might just en to her soothing accerits ;— fine, he knew so well how la use the serpent's art, or such was the will of The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served cls an excuse sor hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her mother's deranged state ,) which was to take place every day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to hurt the seruarits, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrato a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own bonour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, also delayed but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the pharmacist, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the travellings of a maniae. Night passed ori without rest to be busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servantf at last ovorcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the lhecustody of their helpless old woman. He soized the opportunity, with one bound wos out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the apartment where all worenearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthuen whispered his ear —\" Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to the day, your fister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, which pushed him towards his atteridants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; hisrage not finding vent, had broken a hlood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not a menlioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bride groom left London.\nAbbrey weakness increased; the effusion of blood praduced symptoms of the near approach of death. He des ired his fisters guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he reacted composedly when the reader hcls perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but where they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, arid Aubrey's sister had got the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCDUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world will all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we pull into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the eertajnsupply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce inany British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a language. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the boy, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser boarding for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and mysels took a ramble to the oove called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the grow of Mount Ida (a small mountain fo nomed) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Sclo with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with a hair; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old mari, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stoiried walls, marble tables on either side, a large rnyrtle iri, the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, arid an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two sluffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the sitting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large stomach chest in the closel: it was open, but we did not think overselves justified in examinations. On the tablct of the recess loy Vollaircs, Sbakspeare's,Boileau's, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzehues noves; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek Most of these books were filled with marginol notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked withslips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man sald :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he scolled, and forgol to place them with the others; hut,\" said he ,\"there they must lle vntil bis return; for he is so particvlar, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the procedure of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except the zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small oottage in the world, and whom tho lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know whatreasori .\"\nThe appearance of the house extremely was pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen braad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in European architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof of, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong ooarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, or upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking Iight wines, such as \"lacbryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bvshes, a marble seat with anornamcntal wooden back waf placed, on which we were lold, lhe lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a birdeye v view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla,covered with olive and rnyrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small streclm issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, through a vista of lofly chesn ut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solution: none knew his name but Domiriick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Thc Armeriian,\" said our conductor ,\" could tell, but I am sure hc will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friends?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the original feast. He gave a cow to one man, borrows to others, and cotton and talks to the girls who live by wearing those articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we called, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclosc. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was aften seen a king of the seashore, and he had bought her apiano-farte, and taught her himfols the music of the girl.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful side of Mitylenc; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philosophy of disposition, and all those secce-\nthe ntricities which mark peculiar genius. A arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece.\nce ,\"The individual\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trovels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recuse of the callcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researchesat cottage, but we concluded ourselves with the idea of retuming to Mitylene ori some fulure day; but to mc that day would never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, arid in a place to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unf-\neeling disposition, averse lo asfociating with human nature, or contrlbuting in any way to solve its sarrows, or add to its pleasures. The first just directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his position. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his caurting the repose ofsolitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion shall set her seal, and our head Benevolence bath thrown beer mantle. No man can read the perfect pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and both who dares justify bimsels before that awful tribunal, where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellloomy. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and when the world applause, is the surest testiony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Prince, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "26": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE suporstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greekf until after the estoblishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea became prevalent, that a Laljn body could not corrupt jf bvried in their territory, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feoding upon the blood of the young and beautisul. In the West it spread, with sorne slight variation, oll over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyres nightIy imbjbed a certain portion of the blood of lheir vjctims, who becclme emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily diedof consumption; whilsl those human blod-suckers fcltcned—and their vcins became distended to such a slate\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreygo, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a cortain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a uampyre, buthad found a way to rid himself of evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyres grave, and rubbing himself with his This precaution, however, did not prevent this from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death arid burial, many people complained of baving been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his atlacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in classes of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting the moulhlnosc, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have a crledout as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they caught his bead, broken his body, and tbrew the asbes into his grave. The same measures wereadopted with the causes of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just, that a person sucked by a hammer becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to iIlustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it just considered as a sort of punishmerit after death, for some heinous crime cominitted whilst in existence, that the deceased js not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine hls infernal visitations solely to thoso beings he loved most whole upori earth—thosc ta whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Gi\nBut first on the earth, of Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tombbe rerit; Then ghaftly haunt the riative place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sisler, wife, At mldnight drain the stream of life; Yel loalhe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon sor tbeir sire; As cursing thee, The flowers are withered on the stomach. But if that for the time must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy tclsk and mark Her cbeek last linge—her eye Iast spark,And the lasl glassy glance rnust view which freezes over lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow bair, Os wbich, in life a lock when shorn Affections fondest pledge was worn — But riow is broken away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Tben stalking to the sullen grave, Go—cland with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these iri borror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the gravo for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whllst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resolved from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenco. Tho veracious Tournefort gives a cl long account in his travels of sevoral astonishing cases of vampyrisrn, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmel, in bis great work upon this fubject, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditionary narratives ilustralive ofils effects, has put farth some learned dissortotions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superslitiori might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, clrid which inay now be conducted by merely romarkling, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most gencral acoeptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made usc of in various parts of the world: as Vravcol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attondant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the story, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than this rank. He gazed upon the earth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of this fair only altracted his attention, that he might be a look quell, and throw sear into those breasts where thoughtlessness rcigned. Those who felt this senfation of awe, could not explain whence lt arose: some attributed it to the dead groy eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to lho inward workings of the hearl; but fell uponthe cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could nol pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warrner tlnt, elther from lhe blusb of rnodesty, 0 r from the strong emotion of passion, though its forrn and outline were beautiful, many of the femole hunters aftcr notoriety attempted to wjn his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockery of every monster she But though the common advice could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Hc had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form to boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who svlly it by their voices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left alfa to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mlrid to the care of the merriary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of a honovr arid cancer, which daily ruins so many inilliners' appreritics. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vjcc was thrawn in by Providence merely sor the plcturesque offect of the scene, as we see in romarices: be thought that the misery of a cottage merely corisisted on the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colourcd patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded him, striving which should deseribo with least lruth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he ope ried his lips, foon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitaryhaurs, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot from the presentoo of a ghost, but from the want of sneffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of the thal congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquisb his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of sorming an idea of the character of a man enlirely absorbed in himself, wbogave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacil asserit to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagarit ideas, he soon formed this object into the horo of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his riotice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually felt that Lord Ruthvens offairs were ombarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perforrn the tour, which for mariy generalionf has been thought necessary to enable the young to lake some rapid steps in the career of vico towards putling themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the fires, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the benefits ofpleasantry or as praise They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from hlm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men. He glodly accepted it, arid in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHjtherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthvens characler, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than the enovgb to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey would not avoid remarking that it was riat upon the vlrtuous, reduced to lndigence by the misfortunes attendont even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask fomething, not to relieve hls wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity,  This was, however, altributed by him to take greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the various indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordsbip, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those vpon whom it was bestowed, inev jtably found that there was a curse upon il, because they were all either led to scafsold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns lhrough wcls surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cenlres of all fashjonable uice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: hc betted, and always gambled with fuccess, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and lhen he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging sace, with which hc gerierally watched the saciety In every lown, he loft the formerly affluent youth, torn from thecircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; wbilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to solve their present craving. You look no money from the gambling table; but immediately last, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cvnning of the more expensive. Aubrey often wished to represent this to bif friend, and beg help to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this letter occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, arid amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from just than the conftant oxeitement of vajnly wisbing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a timo loss sight of his companion; he left him in daily ottendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, which he went in the searoh of the memorlals of another almost deserted city. Whilst he wos thus engaged, letters clrriued from England, which he opened with eager impatlence; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but afsection; the others were from his guordiclns, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered irito his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason sar the belief. His guardians insisted upon help immediately leaving his friend, and urgcd, that his character was dreadfully uicjous, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduclion, renderod his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, thclt hif contempt for lhe adultress had not originated in halred ofhcr character; but that bo had required, to enharice his gratification, that his victim, the pa rtner of his guilt, should be hvrled from the pinnacle af unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abysf os infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he hcld sought, apparently on\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rost the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and said perceived that his leadership was endeavouring to workupan the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequently. In Italy, it is seldom that cln unmarried female is met with ln society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Avbreys eye followed hirn in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appainted, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, being enlered by the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he would be intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey relired; clnd, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship iri, the remainder of their proposed tour, be ordered his servant to seek other opartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Revethen next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans being foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stops towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of cbronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering sail or many coloured lichen. Urider the same roof as himfelf, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have for ined the model for a pajnler wisbing to protectray on canvass the promised hope of lbc faithful in Mahometa paradise, save that her eyes for too much rnind for any orie to think she could belong to those wbo had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle called the poor type of her because\nties; for who would haveexchanged her eye, apparently the eye of anjmated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an eplcuro. The light step of Ianthe often accompaniedAubrey in his search after antiquities, clnd often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her farm, floating as just were upon the wind, to be eager gaze of him, who forgot the lelters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced lahlet, in the contemplotion of her sylph-like figvrc. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exist in the sun ray such dellcately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgctfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the veryobjt he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none cari appreciate ?— It was innocence, youlb, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling ballf. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to provide a memorial for his suture hours, she would stand by, oncltchthe magic effects of his pencil, in tracing lhe soen es of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open pain, would pclint, to him in cll the glowing colo urs of youthful memory, thc marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made  Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him lhe tale of the living vompyre, wbo had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensving moriths, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of the narlble fclritasies; but Ianthe cited given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confeff it was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could he no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences whichhad all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; her innocence, so controsted with all the affected virtues of women among whoin he had sought for a hif vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an urieducatedGreek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for the same antiquarion research, he would doparl, delermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image thatsoemod alone the rightful possession of his thoughts. Anthony was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because sbe had no longer any one with whomsbe could visit hor favurite haunts, whilst her gvardian was occupied in sketohing or uncoveringsome fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She badly appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several prosent, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very time. Soon after, Aubrey doterrnined to proceed upon one of the exoursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when theyheard the name of the place, they also at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Grcek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who daredta crossed their path. Aubrey made light of lheir representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring lhus to mock a fuperior, an indirect pawer, lhe very narne of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the bolief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and eorneslly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soori end, and that in the horizon there would be one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather irito a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He al last, bowevcr, mounted his horse, detormined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twllight, in these southern climates, just almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, njgbt begins: and erehe had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its ecbolring thunders had scarcely an lnterval of resl—jts tbick heavy roin forced ils way through the canopying faliage, whilst the blue forked Iightriing seemed to fall and radiate at his very effect. Suddenly, his horse looked fright, and was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal atlast, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the rightbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approached, hoping to send some orieto guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the pelting of the storm. As be approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a waman mingling with the stifled, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: hut, roused by the thunder which clgain rolled over his heod, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: sourid, however, a guide hirn. He was apparently unporceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. Ho found himself ln contact someone who he immediately said; when a voice cried ,\"Agairi basfled !\" lo which a loud lough succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by ane whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; bul it wasin vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with eriormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and knoeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat — when lhe glare of many torches penetrating through the hole The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch lacked on every individual straw with heavy flakef of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horrar, when the light of the torohes once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his falr condesctress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arisiring from his disturbed imagination; bvt he gained saw the same form, where he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no color upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast wos blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having apened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultarieously struck with her ,\" A Vampyre! Compare !\" A little was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had clearly been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that bad died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was henumbed and seemed to shout reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a malchr had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parties of the same dreadful catastropho. — To describe your grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsalable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violentscver, and was often delirlous; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven arid upon Iantho—by some unaccountable combiriation he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse them as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in some house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almostrepentance for the fall that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. Hls lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who bad so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he ogain gradually retired irito the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio difference from the former man, except that most times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted hjrn. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs,circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyos of all.\nAbrcy's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the thal elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him riow seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silerice as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wishod for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; lf he sought it clppar wandering amidst tbe vnderwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, wovld show, tohis wild imagination, her palo faoe and wounded throat, with o meek smiled upan her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recolleotiori could be attached: but though they thus hastened from the place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which theylmagined were only the invention of individuals, whofe interest it was to excito the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of this neglecting the advice of the inhabilants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a deferice. Upon entering, bowever, a narrow defile, clt the battom of which was the bcd of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they bad reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistleling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the repart came. Lard Ruthven and Aubrey, imitalizing their oxample, retired sor a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being lbus delained by a fae, who with insulting shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb obove and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a cl shot in the shovlder, which braught hjm lo tbe ground. Aubrey haslened to his absence; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown over their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubroy soon introduced them to envy his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by theirpresence — they were not more disturbed by theirpresence — they were merely to guard the entrance till their eoinrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had a cold order. Lord Ruthvens slrength rapidly decreased; in two days of mortlsication enfued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uneonsciovs of pain as he had been of tots about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye aflen fixed upori Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with moro thari usual earnestness —\"Assisl me! you inay save money — you may do more than that — I mean only my life, I heed the death of iny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, yavr from friends' honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you kriow ofme, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a doy you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breclthed no more.\nAubrey relired to rest, but did riot sleep; the many circumstances attering his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oalh, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about lo eriter the hovel in which he had left the corpso, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and eomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaccle of a neighbouringmount, according to a promise, they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moori that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he held mounled to the sumrnit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbcrs swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. Far time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, even inced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country iri which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superftilious molancholy that had selzed upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naplcs, he occupied himself in arranging those effects, he held with him bolonging to Lord Robert. Amongsl other things, there was an ease containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Wbilft turning them over, and examine their curious forms, what was his surprise as finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hasteriing to gain further proof, be found the weapon, and his borror may he imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held ln bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the parlicular form, the same varying tinls upon the haft and fheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were alfo drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to search for Lord Ruthuen seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of the bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost brokering under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the death of Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupatiori consisted in urging the speed of the positions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which soemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, crowded to lose, in the emhraccs and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she befare, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still rnore attaching as a companion.\nMiss Avbrey had not written that grace which gains thegaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the beauty of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charin about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some foeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul canscious of a brighter problem. Her step was that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensivo. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when berbrother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence suggest those griefs she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the content, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so lorn by the events he hadwitnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to this protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe word was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to block the smile of royalty, hastened the thithor. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first lime he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice herccognized too well, soundod in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, feclrful of seeing a cl spectre that would blast bim, when he perceived, or a little distance, the same singer whichbad attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried sleep, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him—orcumstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had corijured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — determined there-\nore, to go again into saciety; for though he atlempted to talk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He wrote a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a noar relationship. leaving her under the protection of a matron, he rotired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found a bis sister surrounded by several, apparently in earncst conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprarig forward, seizod his sister's arm, and, with bvrricd step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of scrvants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again beard lhat voice whisper close to him —\"Remernber your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sisler, soon reached hame.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrowed, now that the certainty of the monster living againpressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oclth startled him ;—was he thought to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and close his suspicions, what would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for beer, sack, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing skills and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that irnage which haunled him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with being evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiaus for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—froing thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by bis absence the whole of his friends, with a friend omon gst them, of whose prefence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious toforewarn, in spite of bis oath, allwhom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered into a room, his baggard clrid suspicious looks were so striking, his inward fhudderings so visible, that his sister was also lost abliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, sociely which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrarice proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interposeland, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before impossed upon them by Aubrey parents.\nDesirous of faving hlm from the injuries and sufferings be had daily encounterod iri his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incaherence became so great that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for a day, incapable of being roused. He had become emaeiated, his eyes held attained a glassfy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollcction remainingdisplayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that surely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" Where, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he sank into a state, when not even if she could rouse him. This lost many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohcrences became less frequent, and bis rnind throw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardiaris observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed. When, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering this room, began to conuerse with bis physiclan upon tbc melancboly eircumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning Inteleot, af which they feared he had dprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsderi. Thiriking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in soclely, Avhrey seemed pleased, and astonisbed them still more by his expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, this sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he presscd her back to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brothers being once more able to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to corigratulate her upon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at choldiring the features of the monster who had so long influenced his lives. He seized the portrait in a paroxysan of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her osking hiin why he thus destroyed lhe resemblarice of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —then seizing her bands, and gazing to her with a frantic expression of countcnance, he badc ber swear that she would never wed this rnonster, for he — But he could not cldvance — it seemed as if that once again bade him remember his oath —he In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but the return of his disorder, enter-\ndead, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He sells upon his knees to them. He implored, he begged at them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, conceived to protect him, and retired.\nLord Ruthveri had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. Where he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concaled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual bauing no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thal he might listen to ber soothing accents ;— in fine, he knew so well how lo vse the serpent's art, or sucb was the will of fate, that he gained her This title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the content.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardianf, attempted to bribe the servants, but in prison. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who one beld her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to dolay but for a sew hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would not be harass any more the murder of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that mainly inore easily be conceived than described, the notes of a busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of the circles broke upan bis eor. ct: Aubroy grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving them in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seemed the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri calls the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless withrage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered his ear —\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his clients, who, roused by the old woman, had come in a secret touch of him. Aubrey could rio longer support himself; his rage not sending vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the politician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solenized, and the bride and bridegroomleft London.\nAuhreys weakness increased; the effectiveness of blood produced symploms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the night hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians bastenod to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rulhven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence hisguide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylenc, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, introduced many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmon; and though it lies rather out of the track for sbips bound to Smyma, its hountiesamply repay for the deviation of a vayago. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, arid whilst the men wereemployed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nalives, lho clorgyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, arid other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule sonamed) we met with and changed a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the jsland four days previous to the arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a plol ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a very odd man, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he bas left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English eurcency ,) and bas resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he still ln his felucca very osten to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted over the mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-slaor —ari entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, marble tablcs on either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branohes by moving a spring field in the side of a small bronze Venus in a learning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall, slood half a dozen Eng-\nlist cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamer had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts arid a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large searnan chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the lunch contents. On the tablet, the recess lay Voltaires, Shclk speares, Boileclus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Rvins of Einpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Kotzebues Paradjse Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constanlinople, much torri, but no English book ofany descriplion. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messich was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books which euening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have to produce this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who refides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extremely pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black pillars and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher lhari than roof. The roof, surrourided by a light slone ablustrcle, was coloured by a fine Turkish carpet, bonealh an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnifhed, cls upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma chrusli\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small strcamlet glided away, grapes, orangef and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the fhode of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and lights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"playing\" for he was very devout ,\"andalways attended over church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, couered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and ori the symbol of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smootb as glass, and on thehorizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminales the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-lrees, several small islands were distinctly observcd, studding the light blue wave with lots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquirics were fruitless as that the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bonker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"cauld tell, but I am sure who will riot ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" said I —\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the private feast. He gave a cow to one month, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, said he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collecled, also have been a very occentric orid benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought a paper not to disclose. Hc had the most beautiful doughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her humsolf the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all over the rack, guessing this ramber in Greece could he. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folliring in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels from the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard as his leadership the same, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into over the hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the stage, but we confused ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some futuro day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to a high lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unseeling difposition, averse to afsociating with human nature, or contributing in aary way to solve its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly to the reverse, as may beplainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so clearly depioted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderries, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is a clear additional reason for markinghim as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolenco halh thrown her mantle. Noman cari read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not discuss the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with conclusion, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himsels befare that awful tribunal where all must appear, olone mcly censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown-colour, Fleet-street.",
    "27": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superftition upon which this tale is found is very general in the East. Amorig tbe Arabians it appears to be comman: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed this present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which limo, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latinbody could not oorrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West lt spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Australia, and Lor rajno, where the belief exists, lhat vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who bocame emclciatod, losttbeir strength, and speedily dicd of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers sattcned—and their veins bocame distended to such a state of repletion,\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a crcdibleaccount of a particular casc of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, inHungary. Il appears that upon the cln examination of the commander-in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unonimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontierf of the Tu rkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid himself of the evil, by ealing some of the earth This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and trial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been depressed of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrifm) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, liver and blood. Proof having been obtained, they resorted to the accomplished remedy. A stroke was driven entirely through the heart and body of A rnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The sarne measures were adopted with the course of those persans who had previously died from clumpyrism, lest theyshould, in their tvrn, become agents upon others who sur-\nct: guide them.\nThe uriiversal belief is that a person asked by a vampire becomes a hammer himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief a bullie.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because il secms better adapted to jllustrate the subject of the present observation than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishment after death, for some heinous crime eommitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrife, but compelled to consine his infernal vifitations solely to those beings who loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in this \"Gi aour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy curse shall from its tomb be rent; Tben ghastly baunt tho nalive plac e, And suck the blood of all lhy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wlfe, At midnight drain thc stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy uictims, ero they yet expire, Sha But only that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheeks Iast tinge—her eye last spark, And the last glassy glance musl view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affections fondest plodge was worn — But now is borno away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own bestblood sball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard llp; Thcn stalking to thy sullen grove, Ga—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sbrink away from spectre more ccursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced him to his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thaloba\", the vampire corso of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the gravo for the purpose of contacting him. she loved the best whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being poured through the wbole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tho veracious Tourriefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have heen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, clnd traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertatians, tending to prove it to be a classical, as a world of bargain error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely rclrking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblernan, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that much might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensotion of awe could not explain whence it arose: some attributedit to the dead grey eye, which, fixing up on the object face, did not seem to penotrale, and at one glance lo pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wishes to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were placed at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strongemotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female bunters after notoricty atlempted to win his alternatives, and gain, at least, some mclrks of what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw hersels in his way, and did But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent situation with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to fomales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that il even overcame the droad of his sirigular character, or thal they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form that boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully il by their victims.\nAbout the same time, there came to Landon, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an elephant left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in childhood. Left also to himsels by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they reinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary fubalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, chance, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that uice was tbrown iri by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of this scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was hands, ome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay oircles, many mothers surrounded him, striving to describe with least lrvth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, hy their brigbenlng countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false riotions of his parents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for the army of that congeries of pleasing pictures arid descriplions contained in those voluines, srom which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in this gratified vonity, he was about to reinquish his dreams, where the extraordinary being we have obove described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched hirn; arid the very impossihility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of hif ohfcrvation of external objects, than lbetacit asserit to tbeir existence, impIied by tbe avidanoe of their eontact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extrclvagant ideas He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far conceived upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that LordRutbvens asfairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gajning some insormation respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hjnted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tovr, which for many generations has boeri thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallcn from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from hjm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling words.\nHilherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Arthur, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profvese in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagobond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to jndigence by the misfortunes altendanteven upon virtue, that he bcstowed his alms ;—these were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk something, riot to relieve his wants, bul to allow hiin to wallow in his Iusl, or to sink hlm still docper This was, however, attributed by him to the greater impartunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retriring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mlnd: all those upori whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were also either lcd to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and lhe most abiect misery. At Brussels and other to wns through which they passed, Aubrey was svrprized at the apparent eagerness with whiob his companion sought for the ceritres of all fashionable vice; there he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then how lofl even more than he gained; but il was always with the same unchariging face, with which he generally watched the faro table: he betted, and always gambled In every town, he left the formcrly affluent youth, torn from the circle headorned, cursling, in the solitude of a dvngeon, tbe fate that had drawnhim withiri the reach of this friend; whilft many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, wilhaut a single farthing of his late immerise wealth, wherewith to buyeven sufficient to satisfy their present crauing. Yet he took rio money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, then last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resigri that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to help; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and am idst the various wild and rich soenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was neclr the ohiect of his cvriofity, he ohtained no greater gratification from it than the conslant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which lo his cell ted imagination began to assume the appearance of something superncltural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in a long daily attendance upon the running circle of an Italian concert, whilst who went in search of the memorials after almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with cager impatience; the first was srain his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had beforeentered into hif jmagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, this seemed to give a bim fufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for lhal the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered bis licenlious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that bis coritempt for the adultress had not origiriated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his grallfication, tbat hisvictim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullicd uirtue, down to the lowest aby ss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thal all those females whom behod sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in this mean while watching him more closely, and to let the right slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged to carry on his plons in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appreciated, which would not likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to ineet her last night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely lclugbed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the match of the Iady, informed hor of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the cha racter of his Lordship. The assignment was presented. Lord, even the next day morely sent his servant to notify his complete answer to a separation; but did nothing any suspicion of plans having been foiled by Aubreys inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleep towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then flew his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chranicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath this sheltering soil or many coloured Iichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing to pourtray on canclss the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think she could beloring those who had bad no souls. As she danced upon the table plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gclzello a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, ap parently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the last of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after aritiquities, and often would be an unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, flaating as it was upon the wind, to the eoger gaze of hjm, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered upon an almost effaced tablet, iri the contemplatlon of her sylph-like figure. Often would hurt tressef falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading huef, it might well excvse the forgetfulness of the antlquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vilal importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausonias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfocted by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst we drew the thofe remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, fhe would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the fcenes of ber natlve plaoe; she would tbon describe him lhe circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hiin in all the glowing colours of yovthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered uiewiring in bor i nf Her earneftness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited tbe interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and deorest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon lhe life or a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, which he had at least detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and childreri had been found marked with the stamp of She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty oceurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisled in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAvbrey began to attach himself more and more to Ionlho; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of ramance, won his heart; and while he ridicvled the idea of a young inan of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still be found bimself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attainod; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention to the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retoined an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Charlie was conscious of his love, and was ever the same frank irifantile being he had first known. Sbe always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had rio longer any orie with whom she could visit her favourite havnts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, people with a borror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon once of his excurfions, which was to detain hjm for cl sew hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once bcggod of hirn not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where rio Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of those vampy trees in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made the light of their reprefentation, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their bload force, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubroy set off his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was convinced to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his borfe, arid earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon on, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, northern warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous inass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, rnounled his horse, decided to make up by speed for a high delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, if almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain foroed its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning feemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, this horse took sright, and he was corriod with dreadsul rapidity through this entangled force. The animal at Iast, through fatigue, stopped, arid, he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of the ahovel that bardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiflcd, exutant mockery of a lclugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled out his head, he, with a sudden efforl, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in the bitter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; wben a voice cried ,\"Agoin baffled!\" to which a laud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wos in vclin: he was lifted from his seat and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy lhrew himself upon him, and kneeling upon hif The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual strow with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey thoy searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left iri darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of bis fair conductress brought in a lifeless eorse. He shut his eyes, hoping that just was built a visi on arising from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unolosed them, strected by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, riot even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess about her face that seemed almost as attacking as the life that once went there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veiri :— to this thc meri poinled, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was called by the side of her who had latoly been to him, the treatment of such many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flow of life that bad died without her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take a rescue in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soori met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her from a mother badly missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some droadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked Aubrey, and pointed to the oarse. They were inconsalable; both died, broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare lhe being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon charge of the lho state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of hirn whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthuen, by his kind words, iinplying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled her to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appcared that apathetic boing who hod so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same stato of mind, arid Aubrey pereeed n0 difference from the former man, except that at time he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malieious exultation playing upon his lips: he kriew not why, but this During the last slage of the invalid recovery, LordRuthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of those arbs, circling,like our warld, the movoless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the blue eyes of the call.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, is much weakened, and that elafticity of spirit which had once so distinguished them now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silence clsord Ruthvon; but much as he wished sor solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins, he had formerly freqvented, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he thought it ln the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning around, would show He determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created such bitter affections in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greeoerieither had yet been. They travellcd in every direction, and sought every spot to which arecollection could be otlacbed: but though theythus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest will be to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended danger rs. In the consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they trauelled with only a fcw guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large mass of rock brought down from the righthouring precipices, they bad reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating tbeir example, retired from a moment behind the sheltering turn of thedefile: bvt ashomed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouls bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, is any af lhe robbcrs sb sb ould climb above and take thcm in the rear, they determined al once to rush sorward in search of the enemy Hardly had the loft, the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Auhrey bclstened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest of his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him—hjs guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of the royal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to corivey his wounded friend to a neighbouring eabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; iri two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advaricing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of tbjcts about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye ofton fixed upon Aubrey, who was indeed to offer his ossistance with more than usual earnestnoss —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of me, my honaur was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It should not be known. \"—\"Sweeclr !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant vialence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, butdid not sleep; themany circumslances attending his acquaintanco with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his catch, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the prospect of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his reliring, to the pinnaccle of a nejghbouring mount, according to the cl promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moan that rose after his death. Aubrey ostonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted that the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but the heat last returned, convinced that they badly buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apparently occurred to hear that superstitious meancholy that he had seized upon his mind, be rosooved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Will waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a caso containing severol weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamerited in the same style as the daggerdiscovered in the fatol but—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found a weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—lhey seemed gazling to be bound to the dagger; yet still hewifhed to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on the bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rame, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been a child of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of the same one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obediont to his wall, soon wafted him to the English horse; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her inscline caresses, had gained his confusion, now that the womanbegan to appear, she was still more attractive as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assernblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowdboard apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. Thero was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some foeling within, that appeared to indjcate a soul coriscjous of a bright realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a bottle or a colaur may attract — it was sedate arid pensive. When olorie, her face was never brightened by the smell of joy; but when her brother hathed her affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluntary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the local face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eightoen, and he had not been presented to the world. It had been thought by ber guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her proteetor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"bvsy scene .\" Auhrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the friendships of fashionoble strangers, when his mind had been so torn by lbe eventf he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe words excessive—a drawing-roomhad not been held for a long time, and also who were anxious to bask in the sinile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the emergency that the sirst tiine had seen Lord Ruthven waf in that very place —he felt himsels suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized tao well, sounded in hiscar —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a speaker that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, this same figure which had attracted a high notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was able to take the form of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, hethrew himself into his carriage, and was driven horne. He paced the room withhurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started vp in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oalh .— He roufed himself, he could right believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the riame hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Learning her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently iri earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, when he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those pictures he most abborred. He s prang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door be found himself impedced by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remcmberyour oalh !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey becomes almost disrupted. If before hif the mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living ogain prossed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only touched a few words, and those terrified her. The more thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled hlm ;— Was he then to allow this rnorister to roam, a ring ruin upon his breath, almost all he heard dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suggestions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; a wretch; a hut death, he remembered, had been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with cyes streaming with teors, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At laft, no longer capable of bearing stillness and folitude, he left his house, roamed from the street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the indinighl damps. He was right longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he lest by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfcious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch them closely, anxiaus to forewarn, in spite of being oath, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached withintimacy. But when he entered the room, bis haggard and suspicious loaks were from striking, his inward shudderings were so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, asoclety whichaffected hlm strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interp-\nose, clnd, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encourited in his wanderings, a cold of preventing him from exposing that the gene real eye those morks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His income rence became in the last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. Thero he would often lie for a day, incapable of being roused. He had become emociated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the orily sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, selzing her harids, with looks that surely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do riot go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, this ordinary answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he sank into a state, when not even if she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a defiri ite number, arid then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to canverse his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys boing in so awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. The cold of the thifmark of retuming intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thlnkingthis was ayoung Earl, whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonjshed them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptiols, and deciding to see his sistor. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He will apparently again be capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for hc pressed her to hisbreast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished far rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locketupon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at holding the features of the monsler who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, the orid trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him by he thus destroyed the resemblance of her suture husband, he looked as if he did not undersland ber—then seizing her hands, and gozing on her with a frantic expression of counlenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, sor he—But he could not advance—il seemed as is that voice ag ain bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly rourid, thinking Lord Ruthven In the meantime, the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the wholc, and though this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forced him from Miss Aubrcy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, which begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanily, they imogined, had taken possession of his mind, compared to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concerned about those among whom he had gained this information. Hc hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant atteridance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his face, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils also recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no syrnpathy with any being on the crowd earth, save with her to whom he added himself ;—covld tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to soem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents ;— fine, he knew so well haw to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that The title of the elder branch falling al lcngth to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excvse for hastening the marr iage ,( in spite of the hcr brothers deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was lest by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen andpaper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuring beer, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the gravo, who once held her iri lheir arms of their hope and the hope of lheir house, to delay the bill for a few books that marriage, on which he denounced the most heovy curses. The servants pramised they would deliver jt; 6 vt giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the husy inmatef of the hauso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concerned than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon a high ear. Aubreygrew almost frantic. The curiously of the servants at last avercame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He said the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his cell —\"Remember your goal, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women arc frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had some in search of him. Avbrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a vent, had broken a hlood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, or the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader bas perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians based on protecting Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreyf sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE INTHE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of real, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce mariy British vessels to visit it—both men of war and mercharitmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were emplayed in watering, arid the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the eave called Homers Schoollarid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule sonamed) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who toIdus he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with hjm; but I did not choose to quit Mltyleno, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The contact over the bill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mari iri charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcer, six hundred zoehines for it ,( clhout L 25 Y English currency ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he soils in his felvcca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countrymarihad resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mission. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables ori either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa coinpleted the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottonquilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we obseved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was operi, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajres, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rovsfeous works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Ziminermon, in the German language; Klopslock of Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schjllerplcly of theRohbers; MiItons Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek pross at no English book of a copy description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in the Italian arid Latin. The Mossiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"Thelord had been reading these books the evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bul,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, would frowri upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small eottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanaple; I don't know for the whole reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleased. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the futed marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornioes ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roos. The roof, surrourided by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strorig coarse linen. Most of the housetops ore thus furnished, upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in sinoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlot glided away, grapes, oranges andllmes were cluslering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble feat with an ornamental wooden back waf placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twice clock, reading, wriling, and lalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said to the old mon ,\"prayiring\" for he was very devout ,\"and always atterided our church twice a week, hesides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be terrned \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich uineyords led the eye to Mount Calclo, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountainbase. The sea smooth as glass, and an horjzon unshadowed by a single eloud, terminates the view in front; and o little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesriut arid palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; our enquirjes were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic society: none knew hif name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our coriductor ,\"cold tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannol you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can,\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We should not have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learn several particulars of this isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls who he was last upon the island, and he danced with them at the nuptial seat. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and colton and said to the girl who lived by weaving these articles. Hc also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a game, and be osten gauge Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very ecoentrie arid beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage bought a paper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the word was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had thought of her piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the informalization with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessling who this rambler in Greece could be. He bad money, it was ovi dent: he had a plurality of disposition, and all those activities which mark a peculiar genius. Arrived at the altar, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual al ,\" said be ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him al Milylone .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply. did we regret not having been more curious iri our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some fruit day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been greatly slaridored. He has been described as of an urifeeling disposition, aired to associating with human nature, or contributing in one way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the singer feelings of this heart, so elegantly depicted in his leadership poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Teriderness, sympathy, and chority appeor togvido all his actions: and his eourting the repose of salitude is an additional reason for mar king him as a being ori whose heart Religion hath set her seol, clnd over whose head Benevolence hath tbrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be cured with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may ensure the errors of a fellmortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the furest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-sleet.",
    "28": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John Williain Polidori.\nTHE superstition concept which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, exterid itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has orily assumed its present forin since the division of Latin and Greok ohurohes; at which time, the idea he ooming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if bvried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forined the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their gravcs, and feeding upon the blood of In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the beljef existed, that vampyres rightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who hocame cmacialed, lost their strength, and speedily died af consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and oven\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credihle account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stoted to baueoccurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon the examination of the commander-in-chief and magjstrates of the placo, they positively and unanimovsly affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the lho earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been lormented by hirn, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attack. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having contaminated their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual iri cases of vampyrsm) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accomplished remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pclul, at which he is reported to have tried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, broken his body, arid threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the powers of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted toilustratc the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Grocce it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heirious crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased just not only doomed to vampyrise, but compolcd to confine hls infornal visitations solely to the ose beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom who was bound by ties of kindrcd and asfection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first onearth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its toinb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the nativeplaco, And suck the blood of all thy raoe; There froin thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loalhe the banquet which perforce Mvst feed thy living corse, Thy victims, Where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, the flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall be ess thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in slame! Yel thou must end the task and mark the cheek's last tinge—ber eye last spark, and the laft glassy glarice must view which freezes its lifoless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear, the tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in lise a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is broken away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard ljp; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more acoursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thillaba\", the vampyrecorsc of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilft in existence. Both cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of their life, she being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purily arid innocence. The veracious Tournesort glves a long account in his travelf of several astonishing cases of vampyrifm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, clnd traditionary narratives illuftrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissortations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible svperstitjon might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuoted to explariation, and which may now be concluded hy mcrely remarking, that though the term Vampyro is the one in most general acoeptation, there are several others synonyinous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoul acha, Goul, Brou\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midft of the disslpations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various politics of the leaders of thetori a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, their rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear of those breasts where thoughtlessness resigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: somc attributed it to thedead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at once glance to pierce through to the iriward workings of the heart; hut fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weghed upon the skin. it could not pass. His pecuiaritios caused bim to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to v iolent excitement, and now felt the weight of erinui was pleased at gaining something in their presence capable of erigaging their attention. In spite of the dcadly huo of his face, which riever gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form clnd outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after riotoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monftor shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to this virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbo over the same time, there came to London, a yaunggentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duly merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquishod the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltems, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, bence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, while daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed cll 1 to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effecl of the scene, as we see in romonees: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the paintor's cyeby their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many molhers surrounded him, striving which fhouddescribe with least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their spclrklingeyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into f close riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he wasto the romance of his solitary hours, he started atfinding that, except in the talllaw and wax candles that flickored, not from the presence of aghosl, but from the want of snuffing, there was no faundation in real life for any of that congerjes of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very inpossibility of forming ari ldea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other slgns of his observatian of extemal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by lbe avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flatters its propensity to extravagant ideas, be saon formed this object irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his foncy, He became acvailled with bim, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon bis riotice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Deflrous os gaining some iriformation respecting this similar character, who, till now, bad only whetted hls curiosity, he binted to his guardiaris, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rclpid steps in their career of vice towards putting themselves upan an equality with the aged, and nol along there to appear as if fallen from the skies, wheneuer scandalous intrigues aro mentioned af They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him aproposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from bjm, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other friends, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nMatthew, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found, thal, though many more of his co-\nctions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent methods to his conduct. His companion was profusein his liberality ;— the idea, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Auhrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virlue, that he estowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, bul to follow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink bim still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the victims, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumslance about the chority of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion foughl for the centres of all fashionable vice; thore he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betled, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the sameunehanging face, which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash yauthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerovs family; their very wish seemed forlune's law—this apparent abstractedness of inind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more firethan that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the c ircle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the falo that had drawn hlm wilhin the reach of this fierid; whilst mony a sat frantic, omjdst tbe sat frantic, omjdst tbe spoakirig looks of muto hungry children, without a single farthi Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatchod from theconvulsive grasp of the innocerit: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of oombating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent his to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profile ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and only to him; however, this never occurred. Lard Ruthven in his carriage, and omidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the correctant exciternent of violent wishing to break that mystery, which to his exoltod imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernaturol.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of this companion; he left bjm iri daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian cauntess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whether he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eagerimpatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affeclion; lhc others were from his guardians, the attack astonifhed him; if he had before entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately loaving his friend, and urged that his characler was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered hif licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contract for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; bvt that he had required, ta enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnaole of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest clbyss of insamy and degradation: in fine, that al 1 th0se sernales whom he had sought, appclrently on account of their virtue, had, s\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was erideavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it is sad that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was lherefore obliged to carry on bis plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windirigs, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would not likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing na lime, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and ahruptly asked him his inlentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that over night. Lord Ruthven answered that his inlentlons were such as he supposed the call would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed when he inlended to marry her, inerely laughed. Aubroy retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment must declineaccompariying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and colling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he kriew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely serit his servant to notify his complete assent to a separatlon; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nhaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and crossing this Periinsula, soon sound himself at Athens. He then sixed his relationship in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traeing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only beso rc slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured liehens. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wisbing to pourtray ori carivass the promisod hope of the foithful in Mahomets parodise, saue that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who hadno souls. As she danced upon the plain, or trippedalong the mountain side, one would have thought the gazele a poor type of her beaulies; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an aniinated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epieure. The light step of Iantbe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beavty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the eagor gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upan an cellular effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her stress falling, as she flitted around, oxhihit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper penetration of a passago in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-roams and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a mernorial frbis future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his perici 1, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to hirn the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to hjm in all the glowing colours of yourlhful memory, the marrlage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a Her eamestness and apparent belief of what sbe narraled, ex cited that interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the liuing varnpyre, who had pa ssed years amidst hjs friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon tho life of liuing varnpyre, who had pa ssed years amidst hjs friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that thorc could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Reven.\nAubrey bogan to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman among whom bo had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, sorming a plan sor from antiquarian research, he would depart, determined riot to return until his attempt was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilft in his mind he rotained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Theanthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being who had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any once with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in sketching or uncovering some frogmenl which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to parents on the subject of Vampyres, and lhey both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at lhc very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursioris, which waf to detain him for a few hours; when they beard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, af he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had passed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vainpyref in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring things to mock a superior, inferrial power, the very nameaf which apparently moded their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had infpired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eamestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— ho promised. He wos, however, occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, arid that in the harizori there was one of those spccks whieh, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gath er into a tromendous rnass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in those southern climates, is almost uriknown; immediately the sun sets, njghl begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wcls abave—its echoing thunders had scareely an interval of rest—lts thick heavy rclin forced its way through the canopying soliage, whilst the blue sorked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at bis very feet. Suddenly, a bis horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entongled forest. The animals at last, through fatigue, stopped, and how found, by the glare of lightning, that was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or let the least forget to obtain shelter from the plotting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, called him to hear the dreodful shrieks of a waman mingling with the ftifled, exultanl mockery of a laugh, contiriued iri one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, ro used by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudderi effort, forced open the door of the hul. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was a token of him. Hc sound himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: delermined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon hlm, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed upon his throat — when the glore af many torches penetrating through the bole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he inslantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, arid in the cold moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer hoard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, wassoon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, arid the trash loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the delre of Aubrey they searched for her wbo had attracted him by her cries; he will again left in darkness; bul what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy farm of his fair conductress brought in a lifcless course. He hurt his eyes, hoping that it was built a vision raising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colover upon her eheek, riot oven over her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her rick and breast waf blood, and upon her throat where the marks of teeth having operied tbe vein :—ta this tbe men polnted, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A Iitter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the fide of her who had lately been to hlm the object of so many bright and falry visions, now fallen with the flow of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost uricorisciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the but. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her when a mother had missed. Their lainentable cries, or they approached the city, forewarried the parents of some dreadful calastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They wore inconsolable; both dubbed a broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a inost violent sever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Rutbven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountoble combinationori he served to beg of his former companian to spare the being he Ioved. At other times, he would imprecate the principles upon his head, and curse him as her defense. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever rnotive, uponhearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in this samo house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him house. I'm over. he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven,by his kirid words, implying almost repentanoe for the foult that had caused their separation, and still more by the alternative, anxiety, and care which he showed, soori reconciled him to this presence. His lordship seemed quite ehanged; hc no longer appeared that clpathelic being who had so aslonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived rio differerice from the former man, except that at times hc was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exutation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunte During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless suri ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitudc and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in amidst the ruins, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, hor pale face clnd wounded t hroat, with a meek smile upori her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assoclation in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They traveled in every direction, and sought every spot that which recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from placo to place, yet they seemed not to heed what theygazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight lhese reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the gerierosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on an occasion they travelled with only a few guards, rnore to serve as gvides than as a deferice. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring preclpices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of the bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several gvns. In an instant, their guardf had loft the m, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering tum of the defile: butashamcd of being lhus detained by a foe, who with insulting shoulf bade thoin advance, and being exposed to vnresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should drink clbove and take thcm in the reor, they determinod at once to rush forward in search of the eriemy Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the coritest or his own peril, was soon furprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately hrown up their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; clnd having agreed upon a ransom, he was no rnore dlsturbed by their prefence—they being content merely to gua rd the entrance till their eomrade should return with the promised svm, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct arid clppeararico bad not changed; he seemed as unconscious ofpain af he had been of the objeots about him: bvt towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, arid his eye often fixed vpon Aubroy, who was induced to offer his asslstance with more than vsval earnestries —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than thal — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honor, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? time. how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if yav would ooncealall you know of mo, my honour was free from stain iri the world's mouth — and lf my death was unknown for some time in England —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and cl day you will not impart your knowledge of my ores or de ath to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; hesunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey cried to rest, but did not sleep; the mariy circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of sornething horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met bim, and informed him that it wasn't longer there, having been conveyed by himsels and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had givenri his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first eldest ray of the inoon that rose after his death. Aubrey clstonished, and taking the severol of men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mourited to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though therobbers swore they printed out the identical rock on which they had said the body. For a line, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at Iast returried, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clathes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchically that had scized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a uessel to convey a hlm to Dtrarito, ar to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Arnongst other things there was a case containing sevoral weapons of advice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious sorms, what was his surprise at finding a sheclth apparently ornamented in the same stylo as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he sbuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the wcapori, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered the wcapori, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered the wcapori, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered the wcapori, and his horror may be His eyes seemed to needno further cortainty—they seemed to be going to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snotch from Lord Stevens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of the silence the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so manyrepealed horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appcared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sistor, all the memory of the past. If she was before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attacking as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey bad not that winning grace with gains the gaze and applause of this drawing-room assemblies. Thorc was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind, health. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate the soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluntary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, aridhad not been presented to the world, it has been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentalion should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the touch of her entry into the \"busy sceno\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the marision of his father, and fed upon the melancholy which averpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, beedless of all around bim, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly sounded by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly courage to lurn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast this, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which was bad att-\nracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost rushing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and force a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed hishands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again hefore him—circumstanoes started up in a dreadful array—the dogger—his oath .— He roused himsels, he could not believe it pofsible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had coniured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; far enough to attempt to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his tips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after a walk from his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; hc attempted to pass clnd get necessary her, when one, whom he requested to move, tumed round, and revealed to him those features he most abhor red. He sprang forward, sprang his sister's arm, and, hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to hirn —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the territory of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in the opinion that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and she terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starlled him ;—was hethen to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all which held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of copying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already moved. Far days he remained in this state; sbut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of boarding stillness arid solitude, he left his house, roamed from the street to streel, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and hewandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; as first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid a brin down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with cl friend amongst them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume against trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving bim from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encourited in his waridorings, and of preventing him from oxposing to the general eye, those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He barely appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoberence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. Thero he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remainsdisplayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then be would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that sevorely afflicted hor, he would desire her not to touch the bim. \"Oh, do not touch him — your love for me is caught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"Truc! True !\" arid again, he sank into a state, when she could not rouse him. This lost many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his ancestors became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, which his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with bis physioian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys hearing in so awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubreyattention was attracled, he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this inark of returning the interest, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the time of the Earl of Mclrson. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avbrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by hisexpressing his intonlion to be present at the nuptiols, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently agairi capable of being clffected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thoughl of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upori hor marriage with a person so dislinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perccived a locket upon her heart; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long insluenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he looked good as if he did not understand ber—then seizing ber hands, and gazing ori hcr with a frantic expression of countenance, how bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance—itseemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oalh—he turned suddenly around, thinking Lord Rutbven was near him but In the meanlimelhe guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, arid thought this was but a return of his disorder, eritered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to dolay bul for one day. The eyes, ottributing this that the irisanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rulhven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could barely be concaled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companian, and, by constant clttendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and inleresl in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Mifs Aubrey. Who could resist hispower? His tongue had dangers and tools to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being an crowded earth, save with her to whom be addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soathing aoconts ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brarich falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged stat-\n e ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure from the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was giving him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, arid the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a moniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be enonceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the study of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a memory found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Where on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in the bus. ear — Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride that day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So crying, he pushed him towards his attendees, who, roused by the old woman, had a race in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was only mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solomnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvbreys weakness increase; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midriight hour had struck, he related oopofedly when the roader hos perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, iri lhe years 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the jsland of that naine. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British uessels to quit it — both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out the lrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties completely repay for the deviatlon of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the cle rgyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previously to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engagod me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but called a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the different jslands .\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our country had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the marriage. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sltting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tahles one another side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branehef by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posturc; a large couch or sofa comp leated the furniture. In the half stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marriage recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which wore them in a large seaman's chesl in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in explaining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Kolzebues noves; Schiller's play of the Robbors; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, bul no English book of any description Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with an apencil, in Italy and Lotin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with strips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading those books the ovening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; hul,\" said he ,\"there they insist lie unlil his return; for he just so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did hire a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of just, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeriian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces, Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillors with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( clock just is now eustomary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of a strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, preparing them, the Greeks pass their everything in smoking, drinking light wine, such as \"lachryma Christian\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlet glidod away, grapes, oranges arid limes were clustoring together and its 6 orders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till two o'clock, reading, writing, arid talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended over church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be called \"a birdeye view .\" A lirie of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cauered with olive and myrtle treef in bloom, arid on the summit of which an anoient Greck temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins desoended in brokeri cascadcs, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a single clovd, torminates blue view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chefnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerad green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our environment fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solilude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And carinot to tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not. \" We had not time to visit the American, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses, love others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and be often given Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which over an old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself to use it.\nSuch wasthe information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philonthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palerino, call our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\" About whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylerie.\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the process of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious iri our research into the college, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene on some suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this sentence, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justioe to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with humori literature, or contrlbuting in any way that sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The facts directly reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegaritly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charlty appear to gulde all his emotions: and his oourting the repose of solitude is an additional reason forclining him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose heod Benevolence hath thrown bermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him, called a countryman. With respect to bis, love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must apply.\nDear, alone may ensure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and when the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virus.\nyour heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "29": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Talo.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superftition upon which this tool is founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabians it appears to be coinmon: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until of the estahlishment of Christianity; and it has only assuined its present form sirice tbe division of tbe Lotin and Greek church rches; at which time, the idoa becoming prevalenl, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their terr history, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorrainc, where the belief existed, thal vampyres nightly imblbed a cerlain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of oonsvmptioris; wbilst these human blood-suekers fattened—and their velns became distended to such a state of recitation, as to cause\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is slated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an exomination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, lhey positively and unaniinously afsirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Hoyduke, named Arnold Paul, bad been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a way to rid himself of evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, This precaution, however, did not prevent hiin from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, mariy people complained of having been tormented by hjin, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and sound it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and flarid blood. Proof having been thus obtalried, they resorled to the occustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the glasses into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belies are that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because use will seem better related to lllustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instaric which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to corifine his infernal visitalions solely to those believing he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded lo in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb beront; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the hlood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed lhy livid livingcorse, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall kriow the demon for their siro; As cursing The flowers are written heredon form. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the hoart lri slame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's lasl spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowod hand shall lear The tresses of her yellow hoir, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affectians fondest pledge wasworn — Bul now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agoriy! Yel with thino own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rovc, Till these in the horror shrink away from spectre more accursod than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire eorse 0s the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, which best loved whisk in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innoconce. The veracious Tourn -!\neffort gives a long accourit in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditionary riarratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explariation, arid which may now be concluded by merely romarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in the most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made vse of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the rnidst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might hy cl look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation and awe could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to pen-\netrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the pierce workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wishes to sec him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagiring their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his sace, which never galned a warrner lint, eirr from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its forrn arid outline was beautiful, mariy of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, al least, some mclrks of what they inight term clffection: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-ro But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to her: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innacent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the drad af his sirigular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those feinales who from the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same train, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan lest with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himfelf by guardians, who thought it their duty mercly to take care of his fortune, whilc they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mer cenary scholars, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in hy Provldence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a mercly consisted in the feeling of clothes, which were so warm, but which were better adapted to the pointcrs eye by their irregulars and various coloured patches. He thought, in the figure, that the dreams of people were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for those reasons, upon bis entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their lariguishing or rompong favourites: the daughtersat the same time, by their brightening countenanoes when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into folse notlons of his talents and his heart. Attached as he was to the romance of his military hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the prefence of a ghost, but from want af snvffing, there was nofoundation in real life for any of the thal congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, bowever, some compensation in his gratified vanity, was about to relinquisb his dreams, where the extraordinary being we have above described, crossedhim is his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of oxternal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their coritact: allowing hif irnagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideaf, he soon formed this object into the hero or romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before He became acquainted with her, paid bim attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were ernbarrafsed, and soon found, from the note of preparation in — Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some infarmation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted bis curiosity, he wanted to his guardians, that it was time for him. lo perform the lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some ropeid steps in the eareer of vice towards putting themselves upon clnoquality with the aged, and not allowing them to apply as if falen from the skies, whenever scandolous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill sbewn in carrying them on. They ensented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intenlions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a rnark as estecm from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men. He gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the eircling waters.\nHowever, Aub really had no opportunity to study hard. Ru has a character, and now he found, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his original. His companion was a process in his literature ;— the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their iminediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upori the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the missortunes attendanl euen vpon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—lbese were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prosligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but toallow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still. Doep care in his iniquity, who was sent away with a rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of bis Lardship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom lt was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were also either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness which his eomponion sought for the contres of the fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his aritogonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it wcls always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when  In every towri, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn srom the circle headorned, cursing, iri lhe solitude of a dungeon, the fate that haddrawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat sranllc, amidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to be even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of rnany, the last gildor he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but he the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of spoak-\ning frankly and openly to him; however, this letter occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratitude from it than the constant excitement of vainly wisbing to break that mystery, which to help exalted imagination began to examine the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Romo, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, which he went in search of the momorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst he was thus erigaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impaticnce; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before enlered inta hif imagination that there was an evil power resident in his company, these feomed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians irisisted upon his immediately left-\nVisiting his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irr esistible powers of seduction, rendered his Incentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, lhat his contempt for the adullress had not originated in the batred of her character; but lhat he had required, to enhance his gratitude, thot his victim, thepartner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the teleast abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, who the character had riot yet shown a single bright point and wish to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purpofing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whofe house he chiefly requested. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on bjs plclns iri secret; but Aubreys eye followed hiin in all his windings, and soon discovered that ari assignation had been crowded, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. losing no lime, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthveri, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, forming him at the same time that he was aw are of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasian; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lody, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prepared. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a soparation; but did not have any suspicion of his plan of having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, the sun sound himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monurnents that apparently, ashamed of ehronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pain, or trippod along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beaulies; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for a lhatsleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his fearch after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, sbow the whole beauly of her form, floating as it wore upon the wind, to lhe eager gclze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an clmosl effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delioalely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, will might well excuse the forgetfulness of the anliquary, who let escape from this mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innoeence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling halls. Whilft hedrew those remains af which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch themagic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the cireling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the growing colours of youthfu 1 mernory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infoncy; and then, turning to subjects that bad evideritly made a greater impression upon her mind, Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled thc irilerest eueri of Aubrey; and often af she told him hjm the tale of lhe living varnpyre, who had passed years amidst hls friends, and dearest tios, forced every yeclr, by feeding upan the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing manths, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted Sbe detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his borror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rutbven; he, however, ftill persisled jri porsuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered clt l the many coincidences which had all tended to oxcite cl belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he should sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, slill he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy forin before him. He would tear himself at times from her, arid, forming a plan for some antiqvarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attalned; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentiori upon the ruiris around bim, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alorie the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the sane frank infantilc being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite clothes, whilst her guardian was occupjod in sketching or uricovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents from the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several prefectured their ex-isterice, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursians, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him riot to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampy trees in their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of theidea; but when he saw the shudder at his daring thvs to mock a svperior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey sel off upon his excursion attended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of hishost, and was concerned to find thal hiswords, mocking the belief of those horrible flends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to theside of his borse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupiod in his research, that he did not perceive that day-Iight would soori end, and that in the horlzon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer cljmates, so rapidly gother into a tremondous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, inounted his horse, determined to moke up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight in this southern climate\nes, is almost unknown; immediately the sun setf, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of tbe storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall clrid radiale at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animals at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he fell in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, be approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from thepelling of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for an inoment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued ln and almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effa hurt, sorced open the door of the hut. He found himself in the outer darkness: the sound, however, guided them. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, s till the sounds continued, and the riotice wastaken of him. He found himself in coritoct with some orie, whom he immediately soized; when a voice cried ,\"Again basfled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted from his feet and hurl ed with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and krieling upon The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, arid thatch laaded on every individual straw with heavy flakos of saot. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was ogairi lest in darkness; but what was his harror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt her :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and even her throclt were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struok with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A little was quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid by the side of a hcr who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now falling with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and soemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been fourid in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom another had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, fareworn the parents of some cruel catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertalened the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both made a brokenhearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and well often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthc—by sorne an unaccouritable combination he seemed to beg of his formor companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledies upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon the hoaring of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose image he hod now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implyirigamost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present. His lordship seemed quite chariged; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the fine state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, excepl that at timos he was surprised to meet this game fixed intently upori hlm, with a smile of malicious exultatiori playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elosticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have felt for ever. He was now as inuch a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atbons; if he sought it in amidst the ruins, he hod formerly frequentcd, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he sought it in tho woods, her light stcp would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, would He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Steven, to whom he held himself bourid by the tonder care he bad taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Groece neither had yet seen. They trovelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus bastened from place to place, yet they seemed riot to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were orily the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended danger. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jhabitanls, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the nelghbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were starlled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shelterling turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insuitting shouts bade them advance, arid heing exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb obove and take them in the rear, they determined clt once to rush forward in the scarch of the enemy. Hardly, they had lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthveri received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his afsistance; and, no longer heeding the conlest or his own peril, was soon suprised by secing the robbers' saces around him—hjs guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their command should return with the promised sum, for which he had an ordor. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the mortification ended, and death seemed advancing with hasty sleep. His condu cl and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the closo of lhe last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, which was introduced to offer help with more than usual eamestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may da more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my exislorice as little as that of the possing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but little — my life ebbs apace — I cannol explain the whole — but if you would control all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my doath were unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried thedying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear hy all your soul treasures, by all your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in an ordinary way, whatever inay happens, or whatever you wanna see. \"— His eyes seemed brighting from their sockots :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shower came over him, as if from the prefecture of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the above iri which he had left the corpse. When arobber met him, arid I informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades. Upon his return, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and laking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they should lay the body. For a tired business mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a curry in which he had met with such trouble misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting sor cl vossel to convey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the hose effects he had with him belonging to Lard Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dangers and attacks. Whlst turning lhem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a shoathapparently ornament in the same style as the dagger djscovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain surther proof, he found a weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he diseovered that it felt, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; bul the particular form, the saine varying tints upon the haft and shealh were alike in spleridaur on both, and left no rooin for doubt; there were also drops of bloodon each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries concerning the lady had attempted to snatch from Lord Rulhvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deparlure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many reported borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became inorose and silent; arid his only occupalion consisted invrging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shorcs; and he hastened to the manslan of his fathers, arid there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ernbracesand caresses of his sisler, all the memory of the past. If she before, by ber infantine caresses, had gained a big affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and appearance of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that lighthrilliancy which only exists in the heated almosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never left up by the beauty of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy cbarm about it which did not seem to arise from misfartune, but from something within, that appeared to indicate a sovl conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was a river brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to hear his affection, and would in her presence forget those girls she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the v olupluary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians make fit that her presentation should be delayed until her mother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was the first approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey weather has remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the event he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prep ready for the next day, which had been arranged as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had riot been held for a long time, and also who were anxious to bask on the smile of royalty, hastened either. The baby was there with his sister. While he was slariding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that very place —hefell himself seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly cooked.\nage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, where he succeeded, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into a bus carriage, and was driving home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again beforehim—circumstances started up in dreadful arroy—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, be could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he atlempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few rights after with his sister to take the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister svrrounded by several, apparently in carnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, sprang his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by tbrowd osservants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erigaged in passing them, hc again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did no dare to turn, but, hurrying hif sjster, soon crowded home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complex-\nexactly was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon the bls thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what he asked his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and lhose terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;—was he then to follow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held declr, and not avort its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remombered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wha, with eyes streaming with tears, besought them, for her sake, to support nature. At lost, no longer capable of becoming stillnefs and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly the image which haunted him. His dress became unexpected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day fun as to midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuertor that any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he lofted by his absenoe the whole of his friends, with a fierid amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to cnler again into society, and watch him closcly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, also whom Lord Ruthuen approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so impossible, lhal his sister was clt last obliged to beg of him to abslain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interfere, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it had a high time to refume again that trust which had been before imposcd upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirovs of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dajly encountered in his wclriderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they corisidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became the last so great that he was confined to his chamber. There would often live for days, an incredible feeling raused. He had become emaciated, his eyes hod attained a glassy lustre ;— he only signed affection andrecollection remaining displayed itsels upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would defire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True !\" and again, he sank into a state, when not even if she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several tirnes in the day he would cool upori his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of the guardians entering his room, beg an to converse with a bis physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anx-\niously to whom. Glad of this mark as returning inlellect, of which they seared behad being deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his express in his intontion to be pre-\nsent at the nuptials, arid design to see this sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to be feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly pereeived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise as beholding the features of the monster who had so longinfluenced his life. Besides the portrait in a paroxysm of the cage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantical expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this rnonster, far be — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him rem ember hls o ath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was In the meantime, those guardians arid physicians, who had heard the whale, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired beer to leave him. He fell upon his knees than them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They attract this to the insanity they imagined to take possess-\nThe ion of his mind, considered to clarify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been revised with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to he the cause of it; but where he learned that he was deemed infane, his exvltation and pleasure could hardly be eoncealed from those among whom he had given this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant atlendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recaunl—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save withher to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, bad began to seem worthy ofpreservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serp entist, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections The title of the elder branch falling at length to hjm, he blamed an importarit embassy, which served as an excuse sor that stening the marriage ,( in spite of her mother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAuhrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardions, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, corijuring ber, as if he valued her own happiness, ber own honour, and the honour of those now in this grave, who once held a hcr in their arms as their hope arid to the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which was denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he informed, the ravings of a mariiac. Night p passed on without rest to the busy inrnates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived their description, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carrlages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The courage of the servants at last overcarne lheir vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive a bim: bc immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried hair from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is disturbed. The women are frail !\" So saying, he passed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, whowaf, not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. ct: The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and brideroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He deslred his sister guardians might be called, and where the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had peruscd — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord. Ruthven had disappcared, and Aubrey sister had glutted the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was called before him, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, since many British vessels visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay the sort of deviation of a voyage. Wo landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for a cattlo with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mouril Ida (a small monticulo so named) we met with and erigaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mjtylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, tbe wine-trader, six hundred zechines for il ,( about L 25 o English currency ), and has rcsided thore about fourteeri months, though only constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time long hastening to the house where our countryman bad resided. We were kindly received by an old inon, whoconducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the grourid-floor — an eritrarice hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spocious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stainod walls, marble tables on either side, a lorge myrtle in the centre, and a smallfountain beneath, which could be made to play through the brariches by moving a spring sixed on the side of a small bro nze Venus in a learning posturo; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookhouse: there were rio mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stussed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout the green. In the slttirig-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examinations. On the lbo tablet of the recess lay Vo ltclires, Shakspeare's, Boileavs, and Rousscau works complete; Volney's R uins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mjllons Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, pririted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with a pile of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had been reading these books lbe evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they mustlie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move on thinking without orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did hire a service; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of learning care of it, except twenty zcchines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house extremely was pleasing. The portico in front was sifty pieces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and frot-work corriices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, walls covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of a strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus surnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we enlered the hovse, a small streamlet glidod oway, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on jls borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle houses, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old mari ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always contacted over church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a birdeye view .\" A line of rich viricyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with alive and mysterious trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in inajeftic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's house. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unsbadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofly ehesant and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldam enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the persori who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew this naine but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" sclid our conductor ,\" could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friends ?\" said I —\"If I can,\" said to him ,\" I dare not .\" We had riot time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had protected eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even drew with them at a large nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new ball for a fisherman who lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testclmonts to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and honevolent character. One circumstance we learn, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not todiscle. He had the most beautiful daughter, with whom the word was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought a piano-forte, and taught himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this karnable in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived to Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeec ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travel on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had never heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious than our research at the cottage, but we oonsoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to ine that day will neuer return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an urifeoling disposition, overse to assooiating with humari noture, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasuros. The focus is directly the roverse, as may be plairily gathered from these little anecdolos. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his home. T enderness, sympathy, and eharity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repase of folitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion halh set her seal, and over whose head Benevalence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the processing pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not ensure a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dclres iustify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may convey the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving consequence.\nTHE END!\nGlitt, Printer, Crown-colour, Fleet-street.",
    "30": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this college is founded if very general in the East. Among the Arabians, it appears to bc comman: it did not, hawever, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming practising, that a Latin body could not corrupt if bvried in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfuls, still extant, of the dead rising from the lheir graves, and feedingupon the blood of the In the West it spread, with some slight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly irnbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victirns, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consvmptions; whilst these human bood-suckers fattened—and theirveinf became distended to such a state of repletion, os to caus\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrifm, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungory. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistratos of the place, they possibly and unanimously offirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been lormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This presentation, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and the cl deposition was mado, but four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted theirHadagni, took up the body, and sound it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting all the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which is reported to have arrived out as dreodfully as if he had been alive. This dorie, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the bases into his groove. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turri, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a clumpyeself, and sucks in his time.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to lllustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous orime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only daomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine his infernal visitotions solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition olluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre fent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Thenghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all by roce; Tbere from lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy Iivid living corse, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demori for their sire; As cursing thee, But one that for the crime must fall, the youngesl, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap by heart in slame! Yel thov inust end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the lost glassy glance must veiow which freezes other ils lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest place was worn — But now is borne away by the Memoricll of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashiring tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to tby sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Asrits rave, Till thcse in borror shrink away from spectre more absorbed than they.\nMr. Southey baf also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Tbalclba\", the vampire curse of the Arobian maid Onoiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting himshe best loved whilst in existence. But this cari riot was supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed throughout the whole of the tole as a complete type of purlty and innocence. The uerclclous Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, in big great work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illusttive of its effects, but put forth some learned dissertations, tonding to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMclny curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which rnay riow be concluded by merely remclrking, that though the lerm Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various ports of the world: as Vroucol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucaloka, \nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the town, a noblernan, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gave up the mirth of around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain wherice it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object focus, did not seem to penetrote, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the fkin it could not pass. His peculiaristics caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent existence, and now felt the weight of ennui, wore pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention on. In spite of the deadly hue of hls face, which never gained a warmer ti nt, either from the blush of modesty, or srom tho strong emotion of passion, thougb its form and oullinc were beautlfu 1, many of the female hunters ofter notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gairi, al least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lody Mercer, who bad beenthe rnockery of every mod But though the common adultrcs could not influence every guidance of his eyes, it was not that the semale sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and irinocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it will that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were inoved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their dome-\nstrict virtues, as among those who sully it by their voices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yel in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they reinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltorns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romontic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' concepts. He believed all to sympathise with virtuo, and thought that uicc waf thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effeot of the scene, as wc see in romances: he thought that the mifery of a cottage merely consisted of the vesting of elothes, which were as worm, but which were better adapted to the painler's eye by their irregulclr folds andvarious coloured patcbes. He thought, in fine, that the dream of poets was the realities of life. Ho was handsome, srank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many rnothers furrounded him, strivlingling which should describe with least truth, their languifhing or romping savouriles: the daughterf at the same time, by their brightening counteriarices when hc approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false nolions of his talents and his morit. Attached as hc was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was st artled at finding, thot, except in the tallow and wax candles that sllckered, nat from the presence of a ghost, but srom want of snuffling, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in lhose volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified variety, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary thing we have above desoribed, orossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the cbclracter of a man entiroly absorbed in himself, who gave a few other sigris of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the iinogination to picture e very tbing that flattered lts propensity toexlravagant ideas, he soan formed this object into tho hero af a rornance He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecling this singular character, who, lill now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for bim to perform the tour, which for mariy generations bas be thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid fteps in the care of vice lowards putling themselves upon equality with the aged, and riot allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, wheneuor scondalous intrigues are menlioned They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentloriing his intentions to Lord Steven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a cold mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHlthcrlo, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to be conducted. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idlc, the vagobond, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Bul Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the uirtuous, reduced to jndigence by themissorlunes atlendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when theprofligate came to ask something, not to rolieue his wants, bul to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his inquit This was, however, attribuled by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally provails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Tberc wos and circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, orsvnk to the lowest and the most abiect misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed,Aubrey was surprized at the apparenleagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he betted, and always gambled with suocess, except where the known sharper waf his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gajned; but it was always with thc samo vnchanging face, witb which he generally wotched the society around: it was riot, however, so when In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the folitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him withiri the reach of this fund; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of a more hungry children, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to sat-\nif they present a crazy thing. Yel, he looked no money from a tbe gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gjldor he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this mightbut be the result of a certain dogree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the rvin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delclyed it — for each day he haped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; bowever, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his car riage, and almost the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he abtained na great ater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break lhatmystery, which to his exalted imagination began to clssume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sighl of his companion; be left him in doily attendance upon the rnorning circle of an Italian countryside, he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened Twitter impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, there seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. His guardiaris insisted upon his immcdiately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers or seduction, rendered his lieentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the advltress had not originated in hatred of hcr character; but that he had required, lo onhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should he hvrled from the pinnacle of urisullied uirtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy arid degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of lheir virtue, had\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single b right point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to even some possible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that bls Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house was chicfly frequented. In Italy, lt is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry ori his planf in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appreciated, which would most likely end lri the ruin of ari innocent, though lhoughtless girl. Losing no timo, bo entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and ahruptly asked him bis iritenlions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intenlions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being prossed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retiredland, immediately writing a note, to say that from that moment he must decl-\nin accompanying his Lordship in the remajnder of their proposed tour, he ordered his seruant to seekolher apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, lnformed hor of all hc knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the ch aracter of his Lordship. The assignation will be prevented. Lord Ruthven nextday merely sent his servant to riotify his complete absence to separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubreys interposition.\nhaving left Rome,Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself of Athens. He lhen fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monumerits that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds offreemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many caloured lichen. Under the same roof cls himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that fhe might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no fouls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought. the gazelle, a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged ber eye, apparently the eye of anima ted nature, a forthal sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often aocompanied Aubrey in his search aster antiquities, and often wauld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmcre hutterfly, sbow the whole beavty of her form, floaling as it was upon the wind, to be eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such deljcately brilliant and swiftly fading hucs, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who lct escapes from his mind, the theory object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But by attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, arid beauty, vnaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling ballf. What he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, should stand by, and wclteh the magic effect of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would there describe him the circling dance upan the operi plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colors of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjects thal had evritly mado a greater impression upon ber mi Herearnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest evon of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the livingvampyre, who had passed years omidst his friends, and dearest tlcs, foreed every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited him the names of old men, She detailed him the traditional appearance of theso monsters, arid bis borror was increasod, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still porsisted on persuading her, that there could be no lruth in her fears, thoughat the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a beliof in the supernalural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman clmong whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an urieducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fai ry form before hiin. He would tear hlmsels at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his ohiect was attained; but be always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, wbilst in his mind he rotained an image that seemed alone the rightful possefsor of bis thought. The patient was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was involved in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, asfirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain bim for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, the clerk the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him to darcd to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring test to mock a supcrior, infernal power, lhe very nome of which apparently made their blood sreeze, was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursiori unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concemed to find that his words, mooking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horselarid earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, sooccupiod in his research, that he did no perceiue that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmerclimates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, moved hif borse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and he had advanoed far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing lhunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its woy through thecanopyjng foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radlate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at least, through fatigue, stopped, arid he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leclves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment fjlent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exul tant mockery of a lavgh, continued in one almost unbroken sourid ;—ho was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced apcn the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: this sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceiated; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found blmself iri contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voi ce cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laughsucceeded !\" to which a loud laughsucceeded !\" to which a loud laughsucceeded !\" to which a loud laughsucceeded hy one whose strength seemod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, hls seet and  The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and then thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flaks or soot. At the desire of Avbrey they searched for her who had attracted him to her cries; he was again left in darkness; but whatwas his horror, when the light of the torches once more bursl upon him, to peroeive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shuld his eyes, hoping that it was a vision arising from his disturbed imagiriation; but he again saw the same form, when he unoosed them, stretcbed by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life thal once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breasl wall blood, and upon her throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, fimultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! Compare !\" A litter was quickly sormed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that bad died within her. He knew not that bis thought wore—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take a refrige in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soori rent bydifferent parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, farewarned the parties of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the correct. They were inconsalable; both died broken-hearted.\nAvbrey being put to bed was seized with a mosl violent fever, and waf often devilious; in lhese inlorvals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unacoountable combination bo seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecote the imaginations upon his head, arid curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Atheris, found, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the silence of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he was borrified and startled at the sight of him whose image was hod now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying the almost repentonce for the fault that had oaused their separation, and slill morc by the attentiori, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic belng who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapld, he again gradually retired into the same state of inind, and Avbrey perccived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was furprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him During the last stage of therivalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raisod by the cooking breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movcless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much worried, arid that the elasticity of spirit which bad ance so distinguished him now seemed to have fled farever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silen ce as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude,his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athenf; if he shouted it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wourided thraat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every structure of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender core who had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greeoe neither held yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a correction could be attached: but though they hadtenod from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow dofile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brougbl down from the reighbouring practice, they had the reason to repent their regligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whlstling of bullets close to their heads, and by the cchoed report of several guns. In instant, their guards had left them, and, placingthemselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashained of being thus detained by a foe, wbo with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climbabove and take them in the rear, they determined at ance to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longcr heeding the contest or his owri peril, wassoon surprised to see the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately hrown up their arms aridsurrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced thern to convince his wounded friend to a neighbouring call; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being consciously merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance did not change.\ned; he seemed of unconscious of pain as he had been of those objects about him: bvt towards the closc of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may have me—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may saue my brother, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .,\" I need a little hul little —iny life ebbs apaco — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from standing in the world's mouth — and if my death was unk now for some lime in England — I — but lifc. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exvltant violence ,\"Swear by clll your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and cl day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to arily living being in any way, what tever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockots :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey retired to relax, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this mari rosc upon his mind, and he knew not. why; when he remembered hls oath a cold sbivering came over the hirn, as if from the prescident of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the lho morning, he was able to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robher met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking a sever call of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it looks. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered iri eonjeetures, but he at last returnedod, convinced that they had buricd the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terriblo misfortunes, arid in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitlous melancholy that had seized upon his mind, to resolve to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects, he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthvcn. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted toensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and attractions. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut—be shuddered—hastening to gairi further proof, he found this weapon, and his harror may be engraved when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hond. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wish to disholieve; but the particular form, the same varying tinted upon the haft and sheath were alike in spleridour on the hoth, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Rutbvens feductive calls. Her parents were in dislress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under many ropeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and filent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the positions, if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English isb shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for an inoment, appeared to love, in the embraces and caress of his sister, all the memory of the past. If such before, by her irifantirie caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gave the game and the appearance of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem toarise from misfo-\ntrue, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step will not be that light sooting, which slrayf, where a butterfly or a colour may attracl—it was selected and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened by the smile of joy; bul, where her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the thrill of the volvatory? It seemed as if those eyes ,— the typhoons were then playing in the light of their own riative sphere. She was not only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It wasnow, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"by busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not sell interest in the frivalities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events who had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfarl to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared sor the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room bad only was held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the family of royalty, hastened either. The baby was there with his sister. While he was standing in a oornor by himsels, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remombrance that the first time he had seeri Lord Rutbven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized tao well, found in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had barely the courage to turn, searful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracled his notice from this spot upon his first entry into society. He gave his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried sleps, and filled his harids upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burfling from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the decld rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he was altempted to ask the enchanting Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in clining information. He wrote a few nights after with his sister to also a nearby relationship. Leaving a chair under the protection of a matron, he rotired into a reeess, and they gave himself up to his own deciding thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many wereleaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest canversaliori; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reveoled to him, those features were most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he faund himsels impeded by lhe crowded af servants who were wicting sor their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisperclosed to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare toturn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unhoeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was a bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held down, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been taught by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wrelch; but death, herembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when a hifsifter came, who, with eyes streaming with teors, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, a trip longer capable of breathing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that magic which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day suri as to the night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the euening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever he ate overtook him. This sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by a hirn who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and wotch bim closely, anxious to sorewarn, in spite of his oath, all whorn Lord Ruthven approclched with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was clt last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, remonstrance praved unauailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, arid, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of soving hirn from the injuries and sufferings who had daily encountered in his wariderings, and of preventing hiin from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engoged a physlicin to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at least so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lose sor days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had altained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and reeollection remaining disp-\nlayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch a harmful love for a friend isaught, do riot go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he preferred, his only answer was ,\"True! True!\" and again he sarik into a state, whence not even could be rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, os the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its glooin, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day hc would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then fmile.\nThe time had nearly elapfed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, beg an to coriverse with his physieian upon the melancholy circumstanco of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to he married. Instantly, hurry attention was attracted; he asked almost to whom. Glad of this inark of returning the intellect, of which they feared being had been deprived, they mentioned the magic of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom who had met with a long society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by bisexpressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to some his self-\nThe correct. They answered only, but in a few minutes the hlsister words with him. He was apparently again capable of being affecled by the influence of her lovely family; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more olive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warrnth, and to congratulate her ber upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and everyaccomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at holding the features of the monster who had so long influencod his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled it under a fool. Upon her asking bim why he was thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her sweor that she would never wed this monster, because he could not advance—it scemed as if that voice again bade bim remember his oath—he lurned sud-\nSuddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had hoard the whale, and thought this was but the cold return of his disorder, entered, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, desired beer to leave the bim. He felt upon his knees to thein, he implored, he begged of them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the irisanity, they imagined the laken poss ession of his mind, endeavoured to pacifyhim, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he beard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his sormer companion, and, by oonstant acceptance, and the pretence of a great affectlon sor brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dongers and loils to recount—cauld speak of himself as os ari individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her that whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, sirice he knew ber, his existence, had begun to seem warthy of preservuation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— in firic, he knew so well how to ufe the serpent ort, or such was the will of fate, The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening this marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was taking place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrcy, when he was left by the physician and his grandfather, attempted to bring the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given bim; hewrote a letter to his sister, oonjuring her, as she valued her awn happiness, her own hanour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once hold her in their arms as a lhor hope and the hope of their house, to delay bvt for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, which thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of a busy preparalion. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of these servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. Ho seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, arid in a moment, sound himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the slaircose, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\"Remember your oath, and know, if only my bride loves the day, your sister is dishonoured. The women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, wha, refused by the old woman, had carne in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himsels; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessels, and he was involved in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nEvery weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisters' guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he relatod composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the first of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grcoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we pulled into the harbour of Mitylene, iri, the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of eattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountiosamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Wo landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and wbilst the meri were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a smallmonticule so named) we melled with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he bad came from Scio with an Englishlord, who left theisland four days previous to our arrival in his feluoca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to gel rnarried. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechjnes for lt ,( about Lz 50 English currency ), and has resided there about sourtecn months, though not constantly; for he sails lri hjs a feluccauery often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time during listening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an ald man, who conducted vs over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, arid a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain berieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. Iri that hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ca se: there wore no mirrors, nora single painting. The bedcbamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pil low — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sltting-room we observed a marblc recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves juslified in exomining the contents. On the tablelof the recess lcly Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Valney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock Messioh; Kotzebves novels; Schillers play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Ita-\nItalian edition, printed at Parma in 1980; several small pamphlots from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Mossiah was literally soribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, ori which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had been reading these books the evening before being scliled, and forgot to placc them with others; but,\" soid he ,\"there they might lle until his relurn; for he is so parlicular, that were I to move one thing without arders, he wouldfrown upori me for a week together; he isotherways very good. I once did hjm a service; and I had the procedure of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I didn't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house, exactly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work prices ,( as it is a riow customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, svrounded by a light stone balustrado, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning or strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are this furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings, iri smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, a group-\nes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large mature bushes, a marble seat with an arnamental wooden back wall placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his ovenings and nighls till twelve clocks, reading, writing, and talking to hiinself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards Ied the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees, iri bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic dooay. A small stream issuing from which ruins descended in broken caseades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and anhorizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a uista of lofty cbesnut cland palm-trees, several small islands were dislinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with a spotf of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were frequently as long as the name of the person who had residod in this romantic solitude: Norie knew his name, but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Arrnenian,\" said our canductor ,\" could tell, but I am sure he willnot ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I oan,\" said he ,\"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolatod lord. He had portioned eight young girls where he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the national feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, arid cotton arid silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boot for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and beneficial character. One cireumstanco we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch will the insormation with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imagiriations all on the rack, guessing who this chamber in Greece would be. He had money, it was unexpected: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar opinions. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling ln company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The indlvill,\" said he ,\"about whoin you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met hiin in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also vis-\ntold him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordships fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our rescarches at the cottage, but weconsoled ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believe it is not quite uninlereting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling dispasition, averse to assaciating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as it may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the firier feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendernoss, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all the basic actions: and his courting that repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set a beer seal, and over whose head Benevolence has thrown hermantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give anopinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when direct against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful trip, alone may censure the errars of a flowmortal. LordByron character is the world of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applauso, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-colour, Fleet-street.",

It appears that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassouia,on the srontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormerited by cl uampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and  This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people comp-\nThe lained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was rnade, that four people had been deprived of lise his attitude. To prevent further mischief, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and enlirely free from corruplion, and emitling at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart andbody of Amold Plul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into this grave. The samc measures were adopted with the corses of those persorif wbo hod previously died from vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their t urn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomontade also has been related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observatians than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is confidered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his unfornal visitations solely to those beingf he loved most while upon earth—thase to whom who was boundby ties of kindred and affection .— A suppofition alludedto in the \"Giaour\".\nBvt first on earth, as Vampyre fent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy rclce; There from thy dclughter, sister, wife, At midnightdroin the stream of life; Yet loathe lhe banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere theyyet expire, Sha As cursing the, though cursing thern, the flowers or with-\nread on the stern. But one that for the crime must follow, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame!

Yet with their own best blood shall drip; Thy gnasbing tooth, and haggard llp; Then slalking to the sullcn grave, Go—cland with Gouls and Afrils rave, Tjll thesein borror sbrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in this wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented cls having returned from the grave for the purpose. or tormenting him is the best laved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of beer life, which is being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracio us Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several aslonisbing cases of vampyrism, that which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides o uariety of arieodotes, and traditionary narratives illvstrative of its effee-\nthis, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be classical, as well as barbarian errors.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible suporstition might be added; though the present may suffiee for the limits of a riote, recessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be concluded by merelyremarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, mado use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened lhot ln the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of tbc leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracts a bit of attention that which might be a look quell it, and throws fear into those bread.\nThe test where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arase: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the beart; but fell upon the cbeek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to evory house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennvi, wore pleasure at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which neuer goined a warmer tint, either from the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emolion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the femalc hunterf after notoriety attempted to win hls attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockery of the rnodesty, or from the strong emolion of passion Bul though the cornmon adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex wasindifferent to hiin: yet suoh was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the vlrtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew to be euer addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred force, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully lt by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon, a young gentleman of the fame of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an angry sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himfels by gvclrdians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenarysubalterns, he cultivated more bis inagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that is a high Roman-\nThe tic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though that vice was lhrown in by Providenoe merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in Romanoes: he thought that the misery of a cattclge merely consisted of the vesling of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye to their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, srank, and rich: sor these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surranded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by theirbrightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon Ied him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary bours, he started at finding, thot, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the scent of snefing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congerios of pleafing pictures and defcriptions contained in those values, from which he bad formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation lri his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we above described, orossed him in his career.\nHe wcltched him; and the very impossibility of forrning an idea of the character of a inan entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacjt assent to their existence, ignored by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extrauagant ideas, he soon forined this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of bis sancy, rather than He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rutbvon's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wbo, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiaris, that it was time for him to perform the lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid sleps in the caroer or vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen frain the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or os They considered: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in commori with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the erriling waters.\nHilhcrto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study LordRthuen's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His coinpanion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid rema-\nrking, that it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indlgence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virlue, that he bestowed his olms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, nol to relieve his wonts, bul to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him ftill deeper in his iniquity, he was sent This was, however, altributed byhlm to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of this virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whorn it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centros of all fashjonable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table:he betted, and cll always gombled with success, excepl where the known sharper was bis antagonist, and then he lost even inore than hc gained; but it was always with the same uncbangiring sace, with which his companion thought for the centros In every town, he lest the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the oircle be ad orned, cursing, in the folitude of a dungeon, the fate thal had drawn him within the reach of this fierid; whilst mariy a father sat fraritic, omidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealth, wherowith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of mariy, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to reslgri that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, bc obtained no greater grolification from it than the constant oxoitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of the same thing supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time last sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilsl he was thus engaged, lettcrs clrrived srom Englarid, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his company, these seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible power of seduction, renderod bis incicentious babits more dangerous to society. It had been dlsco vered, that his eontempt for the adultress had not originated in hcltred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance bis gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: iri fine, that all those semales whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to prevent some plausible pretext for abaridoning him altogether, purposing, in the medical while, to watch him more closely, and to meet no slight circumstances passed by unnoticod. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that bis Lordship was recommending to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chjefly frequently. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was there fore obliged to carry on his plans in the street; but Aubrey's eye followed them. ln all his writings, and soori discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocont, though a thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intenlions were sueb as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and poor being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; ond, immediately writing a note, to fay, that from thal moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartinents, and calling upon the mother of the Iady, infarmed her of all he knew, not only with regard to ber daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignalion was proven. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been followed by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, the foon found himself at Athons. He then fixed his rosidencc in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traoing the faded records of anoient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freomen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneclt the sbeltering soil or many colouredlichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a helng, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing lopourlray canvass the pramised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke to a lot of mind for one to think she could belong to those who had no sales. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazeIle a poor type of her beaulies; for who would have excha nged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, sor that slecpy luxurious look of the animal fuited but to the taste of an epicure. The light ftep of Iclntbe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmerc butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eoger gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost offaced tablet, in the contemplcltion of her sylph-like figure. Osten would her tresses falling, cls she flilted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excvse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object hehad before thought. of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in the Philippines. But why attempt to describe cbarms which all feel, but none can participate ?— It was nnocencc, youth, and beav ty, unaffected by cro-wded drawing-rooms arid stifling balls. Whilst he drew lhose remains of which he wished to preserve a mernoriclI for his future hours, she would stand hy, arid watch the magic effects of his perieil, in traoing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling danoe upon this open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made ct: Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, cxcited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the taleaf the living af themselves, who had passed yeors amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femalo to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run eold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible faritasies; but I She detained to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate declaration of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persvading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excile a bellef in the superncltural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected uirlucs of the woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hif heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still to find himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined riot to return until 1. his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to find his attention upon the ruins around him, whilsl in the mland he relained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The native was unconscious of his love, and was never the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from hjm with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst ber guardian was occupied in sketchling or uncavering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of the bus excursions, which was to detain him sora a few hours; whon they heard the name of the place, they oll at once begged of him riot to return at night, as to most necessa rily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal origins, and announced the rnostheavy evils as imperiding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of theirrepresentations, and tried to Iaugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infemal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood free ze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey sel off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to overcome the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, inocking the belief of those horrible friends, had irispired thern with such terror. When we were about to deparl, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, the cre night allowed the power of those beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so oocupied in his research, that he did not perceiue that day-light would end, and that in thehoriz0n there were one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, fo rapjdly gather into a tremondous mass, and pour all their circle upon the devoted country .— He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, delermined lo moke up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and he had odvariced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the c annoying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took a sright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the rightbourhood of a hospital that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mirigliring with the stifled, exutant mockery of a lclugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided the train. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still found continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, which was immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\" Again bafflicted !\" lo which a loud lavgh svcceded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as be crowded; but it was in valn: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upori him, on kneeling upon his breast, had plaoed his hands upon his throal—wheri the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual ftraw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey lhey searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his four coriducture ss brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from hls disturbed imagiriation; but be agairi saw the sane from, when he unclosed them, slretched by his side. There was no color upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that scemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this tho men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with borror ,\" A Varnpyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was said by the side of her who had already been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—hismind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflectian, orid take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular correction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, after they approached the city, forewamed the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascerlained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were unconscious; both died brokenhearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccounlable combination he seemed to bog of his sormer companion to spare the being to loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in this somc house, and became his oonstonl attondanl. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had known combined with the thal of a Varnpyre; but Lord Rulh-\neven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; be no longer appeared that an apothetic boing who had so astonished Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he began to gradu-\nally retirod into the same state of mind, clrid Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malieious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew no why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engoged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of thoseorbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyof of all.\nAvbreys mind, by this shock, was much crowded, arid that the elasticity of spirit which held once so distinguished him riow seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitvde and silencc as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wifhed for solitude, hls mind would not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then su ddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to play the scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associatives in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, then they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a resolution could be cltached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much ofrobbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to exercise the generosity of those whom they defended from the presented dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inbabitants, on an occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upori entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighboring precipices, they had the reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the porty engaged in the narrow pass, when they were starlled by the whistleling of bul-\nct: lets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In instant-\nand their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shellering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a fire, who with insulting shouts bade them aduance, arid being exposed to unroslstiring slaughtcr, if any of the robbers should cl imb above and take them in the rcar, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by feeling the robbers' face around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon indvced them to oonvey bis wounded friend to a neigbbouring chain; and havingagreed upon a ransom, he was no inore dislurbed by their presence—they being content nearly to guard the entrarice till their comrade should retum with the prarnised sum, for whichhe had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification resulted, and death seemed to be advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of objeets about him: bul towards lhe olose of the last evening, his mind he became apparentlyuneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer bis assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence class little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cann atexploin the whole — but if you would concoal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my doath were uriknown for some time in England — I —I — but lise. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried by drinking man, raising himself with exultanl violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to only living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their socket :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he said laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; he many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mlrid, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a good sbivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, arid informed him that it was no longer there, having been involved by himself and camrades, upon hif retiring, to the pinna-\nthe circle of the neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray and the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, be found no trace of either the corpse or the elothes, though the rohbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but which at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he bad metwith such terriblemisfortunes, and in which also apparently conspired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had seized upon his mirid, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the lhase effects he had with whom belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, rnore ar lefs adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turriing them over, and examining their curlous forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the daggordiscovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found lhe weapon, and his horror may be imagined where he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to noed no further certainty—thoy seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet slill he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood oneach.\nHe left Smyrno, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their forlune ruined, and she had only been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Abrcy's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became my orose and silerit; and his only occupalion consisted in urging the speed of these postings, as if he were going to saue the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the inarision of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appearedod to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sisler, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infattine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more touching as a companion.\nMiss Aubroy had not that winning grace which gave the game and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliantly which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind boneath. There was a meancholycharm about it which did not seem to arise from mlsfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indlcate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strayf where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs, she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? I seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native speaker. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was having been thought by her guards more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continuing, where might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fost approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the blue \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nct: The crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious toash in the smile of royalty, hastened the thilher. Everybody was there with his sister. While he was slanding in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the rememrance that the first time he had seen Lard Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toa well, sounded in his ear —\"Rememher your oath .\" He had hardly co vraged to turn, fcarful of seeing a special ticket would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice, an lhif spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were asraid his thoughts, he was bursling from the bus train. Lord Rut hven again before him —circumstances started up in dreadful array —the dagger —his oath .— He roufed hirnsclf, he covld riot believe it possible —the dead rise again !—Ho thought his imclginatiori had conjured vp the image his mind was resling upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go ogain into society; for though he attempted to ask the concerned Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the high protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and then gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perccing, clt last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to inove, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most obhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he agairi heard that voice whisperclosed to him —\"Remember your oalh !\"— He dld riot dareto turn, but, hurrying his sister, saon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before hjs mlnd hcld been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in clinical thal which lent him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was a bucket. His oath startled hjm ;— Was he thought to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held deor, and not avert itsprogress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of omploying his own hand to free the world frornsucb wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and the other only when his sister came, who, with eyes streoming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillnoss and solitude, he left his house, roaming from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became negleeted, and he wandered, as the other exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sifter, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon diftanced by him who fled from a pressure swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his conscience the whole of his friends, with a siend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch bim closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whoin Lord Ruthven approacbed with iritimacy. But when heentered into the cell room, his baggard and suspicjous looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to bog off hjm to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrclence praved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpase, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allenaled, they thought it high time to r resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily unoountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing that the general eye those marks of what theyconsidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incohorence became at last so great, that he was confined to the blue chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being moved. He had become emaciated, his eyes bad altained a glassylustre ;— the only sign of affection arid recollection repairing displ ayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, on, seeing her hands, with Io oks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch them. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, the only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. Tbls lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his lncaherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had rioarly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, once of his guardians eritering his room, began toconverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumslance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared which had been developed, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Mar sden. Thinking this was a yaung Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flow-\ning at the thought of her brother being more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to concentrate on her vpon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accom plishinent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breaft; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus deslroyod the resomblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing ber hands, arid gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade ber swear that she would never wed this inonster, for he— But be a cld riot advanee—il seemedas if that once again bclde hiin remember his oa In the moment, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was a but cold return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubroy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of thern to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endured pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming after the drawing-room, and had been confused with overyone else. When he heard of Aubroy's full health, he readily understood himsels to the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenee of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, be gradually won the ear of Miss Aurey. Who could resist his power? His tongue child dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympatby with any being on the crowdod earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell haw, sin once he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it merely that hc might listen to her soathing accents ;— fine, hc knew so. well, how to use the personnel art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling clt length to him, he obtained an important ombassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure from the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sifter, conjuring her, cls she valued her own happiness, her own hanour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but sor cl a few hours without marriage, on which he denouncod the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; bvt giving it to the physician, he thought itbetter not to harass any more than the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the bouso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concerned than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grows almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving a birn in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seemed like an opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the bim: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthvenwhspered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, rushed by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubroy could na longcr support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bcd. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entored, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride arid bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He disguised his sister's grandparents might be called, and when the night hour bad struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardianshastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glulted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tho world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majefty's verses, in the year 1812, we put into the harbor of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British uessels to visit it — both men of war and mercha-\nntmen; and though just lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landod; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargclining for a cattlc with the natives, the clergyman arid myself took a ramble to the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our rival in his festival. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an old, but a very good man. The contract over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines sor it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has decided there about fourteeri manths, though not contrary; sor he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited about our curlosity very much, and we lost no time in hasteriing to the house where our country had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floar — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlover, and a hed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grecn-stained walls, marhle tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could bemade to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed iri, the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedbarnber had merely a lorge mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-rooin we observed a marblc recess, formerly, the ald man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in explaining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajres, Sbakspeare's, Bojleaus, and Rousseou works coinplete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; SohilIor's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pa rma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tor Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribhled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they mistlie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I also moving one thing without orders, he would frowri upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who rosides in a small cottage in the wood, cland whoin the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces looking and fourteen broad, and the fluted marblc pillars with black plinlhs and sret-work corriices ,( cls it is now customary in Grecian architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the housotops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evening in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, after we entered the house, a small stroclmlel glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustoring together on its borders, and under the shade of two largecmyrtle bushcs, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were lold, the lord passed many of his euonings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading,writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, these Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be the termod \"a birdeye view\". A line of rich virieyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small streclm suffering from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was last in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glclss, and an borizon unshadowed by a fingle eloud, termiriates the view in front; and a Iittle on lholeft, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly obserued, studding the lghl blve wove with spols of emerald green. I felt enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries wore fruitful as to the riame of the person who had rosided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"would tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on over return to the town we learntfeveral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even dragged with them at the riuptial feast. Ho gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a freshman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek treatment to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and henevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which over an old friend at the cottage, thought paper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a pianoforte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mjtylene; our imagiriations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said be ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, cls we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put irito our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more serious in our research at the college, but we confused ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, belleving it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship good name, which has been grossly slandored. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to foot its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little answers. All the finer feelings of the heart, from elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, some to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose heart Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man cares to read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countrymari. with respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caulion, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares just ustify himself before that awful trial where all must appear, alone inay censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the sureft testimony of a nervous heart and self-approving confidence.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "32": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabians, it appears to be common: it did not bow-\ncvor, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt lf buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with somc slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lose their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst lhese human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the possages of their bodies,\nIn the London Journal, of Maroh ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible ac count of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It clppears, that upon examination of the commarider-in-chief and magistratos of the place, they positively and unanimovsy clfsirmed, that, about five years before, a certclin Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiors of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a varnpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating somc of This precautiori, bowever, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty doys after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and einitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pure cold florid blood. Proaf having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they put off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. Some measures were adopted with the powers of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their tvrn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just, that a person sucked by the avampyre becomes a vompyre himself, and sucks iri his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations that any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, far some crimes committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrlse, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely lo thoso beings he loved most while upon earth—tbose to whom he was bound by ties of kiridrcd and af fection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corfe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, Aridsuok the blood of all lhy race; There from thy daughter, sisler, wife, At midnight drairi the stroclm of life; Yetloathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy living oorse, Thy victims, ero they yet expire, Shall know the demori for their sire The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best beloued of all, Sball bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thov musl end thy lask and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye last spark, And the last glclsy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hand shall tear The trosses of her yellow bair. Of which, iri life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borno awoy hy the Memorial of thirtie agony! Yet with thine own best blood fball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to by svllen grave, Go—arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sou-\nthey also introduced in his wildbut beautiful paem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian majd Oncizcl, who is represented as having returried from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved what existsenee. Bvt this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed through the whale of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several clstonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his groat work upon this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrclatives illustrculliue of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstittion might be added; though the present moy suffice for the limits of a note, nocossarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be coricluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several other synonymovs with it, made use of in var-\nious parts of the world: as Vrouoolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, etc.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissjpatioris attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the town a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He goes upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in religion. Apparently, they laugh a little later of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where loughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose:some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the teetical face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through the long workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leadcn ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities asked him to be invited to euery house; all wishes to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now we felt the weight of ennui, were plcased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of thedeadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of whol they mightterm affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfter shewn in drawing-rooms since her marrlage, lhrew herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a But though the common odultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyef, it was not that the female sex was indlfferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to fomales. He had, however, the reputotion of a wrong tongue; and whether it was that it evenavercame the dread of his singular character, or that lhoy were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who forin lhe boast of their sex from their doinestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their victims.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sifler in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to him .-\nsclfby guardians, who thought it their duty remained to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltems, he cultivated more his im aginalion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many million apprentices. Hebelieved all to sympathise with nature, and thought that the vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a coltage merely consisted in the vestiring of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. How thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the recllities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surranded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languisbing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and hls merit. Attached cls he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at flriding, that, except in the tallow and wax oandles that flickered, not froin the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation ln real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and desoriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to reliriquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed her in his career.\nHe watched him; and then very impofsibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely ahsorbed iri himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the lacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imoginalion to piclure everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forined this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the pers He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence would always be recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and saon found, from the notes of preparation in — Streot, that he was able to travel. Desirous af gaining some infarmation respecting this singular child actor, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it would time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enablo the young to take some rapid sleef in the earre of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as lf fallen from the skjes, wbonever scandalous intrigues are mentioned They confented: and Aubrey immediately menlioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from a bim a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of the system from him, who, apparently, had nothing in cornmon with other men, who gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Auhrey bad had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different coriclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was proposed to his liberolity ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Auhrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bcstowed his alarms ;—these were senl from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with This was, however, attributed byhim to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more linpressed upon this mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a cu reseupon it, so they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other townf through which they passed, Aubrcy was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his company sought for tbe centros of all fashionoble vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watohed the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered In every town, he lest the formerly affluent youth, torn srom the circle he adorned, eursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reason of this friend; whilst rnany a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immensc wealth, wherewith to buy enough sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he tookno maney from the garnbling tablo; bvt immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snalched from the convulsive grasp of being innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge e, which was not, however, capable of combating the ounning of the more experienced. Avbrey often wished to protect this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but be delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than hls lip; and though Aubrey was remark the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of this coinpanion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memarials of another almost deserted city. Whether he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, hreathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreodfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of education, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been disoovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not origiriated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratitude, that his victim, thepartner of hjs guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urisulled virtue, dawn to the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtuc, had, since his deparlure,\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to correct the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning bim altogether, purposing, intho mean while, to watchhim more closely, and to let no slight circumstonces pass by the nnotioed. He eritered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeauouring to work upon the inexperience of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though tboughtloss girl. Losing rio tirne, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and a baby asked him his attention with respect to the lcldy, infarming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Rutbven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avbrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and colling upon the mother of the lady, iriformed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also conce-\nrunning the character of his Lordship. The assignalion was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day morely sent his seruant to riotify his complete account to call separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and crossed the Peninsula, soon found himself at the Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon accupied himself in tracing to faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slavef, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltoring soil or many coloured llchen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahoinets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited hut to the taste of an epicure. The light stop of Ianthe often accompaniod Aubrey in hissearch after antiquities, and osten would thc unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floaling as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he bad just docyphered upan an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s unray, such delicately. brilliant and swiftly fading bues, it might well cause the forgetfulness of the anliquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of what he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, fhe would stand by, and watch the mogic effects of his pencil, in tracing the seenes of her riative place; she would then describe to hirn the cireling dance upori the open plain, would paint, to him in clll the glowing oolourf of youthsul memory, the marriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaney; and then, turning to subjects that Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled the interest even os Aubrey; and often af she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had bcld passod years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced overy year, by feeding vpon the life os a lovely female to prove his existence for the ensuing montbs, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to hlm the ncld years She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monstors, and his horror was increased, by hearing a prelly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greck girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy sorm before him. He would tear himself off at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whllst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the samo frank infantile being had first known. She always seemed to part from him with respect; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite havnts, which her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, offirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Auhrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which would also detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as be must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day should be closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made a light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw the lhern shudder at his daring house to mock a superior, infernal power, the very riame of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to obse-\ndrive the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned. to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceivo that day-light would soon end, clnd that on the horizon there was ane of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at least, however, motivated his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern cllmates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its touching thuriders bad scarcely. the rain interval of results thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying folioge, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate of his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled sorest. The animal atlast, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hotel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone that guided him to the town, or at least tru-\nsting to obtain a shelter from the pelling of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, sor a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the tbunder which agairi rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Agairi baffledged!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determinod to sell his life as dearly as he could, he strugg-\nled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with an enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placcd his bands upon his throat — when the glare of many toro-\nhcs penetrating through the holc lhat gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rufhed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the brancbes, as he broke through the wood, was rio longer heard. The story was still now; and Aubrey, capable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the black lacked on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desiro of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by beer cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his borror, when thelight of the torches once more burst upori him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it will but a vision arising from his disturbediinagination; but he again saw the same form, where he unclosed them, stretched by his fidc. There was no colour upon her cheek, nat even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that secmed almost as attaohing as the line that one dwelt there :—upon her neck and breost wos blood, and upon her throat were the marks of leeth having opened the vein :— to thif the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was loid by the side of her who had already been to him the object of so many bright and foiry visions, now fallen with the flower of life thal had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vocaney — he held almosturiconsciously in hif hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been sound in the hut. They wore so much by different part-\nies who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had misfed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned both parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they asoertained the cause of their child death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were incorisolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, arid was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upor Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he looked. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motivation, the upan hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in some house, and became his constant constant. Whon tbe lattor recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled ot the sight of him w bose image he had riow comhined witb tbat of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, implying almost repentance for the fault lhat hcld caused theirfeparatiori, and still more by the attentlon, anxiety, and oare which he showed, soon His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that an appatbetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvalescence began to be rapid, he agoin gradually rotired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his game fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inal icious exultation playing upper his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Rvthuen will apparently engage in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, clrcling, like our world, the moueless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyos of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much worried, and that the elasticity of spirit which was bad once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwaod, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginalion, her pale face and wounded throal, with a meek smile upon ber lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such a better assaciations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom which held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They traveled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they might-\nthe ined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of this neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a sew guards, more to servo af guide than as a defon ce. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrenl, with lorge masscs of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they bad reoson to repent their negligence; for scarcely wero the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In the cold instant, their guards had left the lhem, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the repart came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shelloring turn of the defile: but ashamed of being tbvs detained by a soe, wbo with insulting shouts had them ad vance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should elimb above and take them in the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards hauing, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately lhrown up their arms and surreridered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon introduced them to corivey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransoin, he was no inore distvrbed by their preserved by their preserve — they being entent merely to guarantee the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which hc had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty feet. His conduct and appearance had notchanged; he seemed as unconscious of the pain of the last evening, his mind became apparently urieasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more that that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain that whole — but if you conceal all you know of me, my hanour were from stain iri the world's truth — and if my deal was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himsels with exultanl violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, sweck that, sor o year and a day you will not part your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may seo. ct :\"— This eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breached no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; tho many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon himself, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, if he was from this presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse. When a robber met him, arid informed him that it was no longer there, having been coriveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinriacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking a sevoral of the men, decided to go and bury a hill upon the spot where it lcly. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found nolrace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers were they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in corijectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeclry of a country in which he had met such terrible misfortunes, and in which also apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy lhat had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to couples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthuen. Amangst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst tuming them over, and examining their curious forins, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamonted in the sclum style as the dogger discovered in the fatal hut—he fhuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined whon. he discovered that it was filted, though peculiarly shaped, shealh he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelicve; but the particular form, the same variations upon the haft and fheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquirjes were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductivo arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and should not beard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation could insist on urging the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held a declr. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedi went to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hastencdto the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraoes and caresses of his fister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinecaresses, had gone his afsection, and now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze around the applause of the drawing-room assemblics. There was none of that light brilliant which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never built up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy c claim about it which did not seem to arise from inisfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a bulterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affecti-\non, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluntary? It seemed as is those eyes ,— that face was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It had been thought that her guardians would not fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when she might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her country into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remaining in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the srivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so tornby the students he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, haftened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in aoorner by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the last time he had seen Lord Rulhuen waf in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oalh .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fea fea fvl of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perccived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a possage through the crowd, he threw himself into a bus carriage, and was driving home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed half hands upon hishead, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burstjring from this brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise clgain !— He thought this imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could he really — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leoving her under the protection of a matron, he related to a recess, arid there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appear-\nritly in the earliest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whorn he requested to move, turned round, and rushed to blame those features he most abhorrod. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, arid, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: al the devil he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing thern, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your path !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monslers living again pre-\nThe second thoughts. His sister's attention was now uriheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only wrote a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His path started him ;—was hc tben to allow this monster to roam, hearing a rule upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert his progress? His very sister might have beentouched by him. But even if we were to break his oath, and discuss his suspicions, who would believe this? He thought of copying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been clearly mocked. For days, remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, consciousness to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became unglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the Monday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; a first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue avertook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by hif ahsence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfcious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was not also obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to inlerpose, arid, fearing that his mind was becoming aljenated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDosirouf of saving him from this injuries and sufferings have had a daily encounter in his wanderings, and of preventing him from expasing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physiciari to reside in the house, and take constant care of them. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind obsorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became in the last so greclt, that he was credited to his character. There would often lie four days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remairiing displayed himself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, scizing her hands, which looks thatseverely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Ob, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he was reserred, his only answer was ,\"Truetrue !\" and again he sank into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This lasted many moriths: gradually, however, as the year was passing, hif incoheronces became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day who would count upon his fingers a firiite number, and then smile.\nThis time had nearly elapsed, wben, upon the last day of the year, one of the bis guardians entering this room, began to oonverse with his physician upon the melancbolyccumstance of Aubrey's being in such an awful situation, when bis sister was going next day to be inarried. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad 0s this mark of retumling intelet, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Cell of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubroy seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptiols, and desiring to seo bis sister. They answered not, but in seven minutes his sister was with him. Hc was apparently agoin capable of being clffected by the influence of her lovely smile; so he pressed her to his breath, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing of the thought of her brol her beiring once more alive tothe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of themonster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trompled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as jf he did nat understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could riot advance — it seemed as if that v oath —he tumed suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the wbole, and thought this was but a return of bif disorder, ontered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his kriees to them, who implored, he begged them to delay but for a nice day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paoify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill healt b, he really understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concerned from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constarit attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the oar of Miss Averley. What could resist his player? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed bimself;—oould tell how, since he knew her, his existence, hcld begun to seem worthy of preservation, lf lt weremerely that he might listen to her soothing aocents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serperits art, or sueh was the The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the content.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physielan on his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in japan. He asked for pen clnd paper; it was given him; he wrote a cl letter to his sister, conveying ber, as shevalued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any rnore the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nighl passed on without reply to the busy inmatos of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be canceived than described, the notes of busy preparatiori. Morning came, and the found of carriages broke up his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost franlic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was the soul of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircose, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pusbed him towards his talent, who, roused by the old woman, had come into search of him. Aubrey could no loriger sup-\nport himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken cell blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was a riot present where he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAuhreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symploms of the nuclear approach of death. He desired his sister guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had pervsed — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians listened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthuon had disappeared, and Avbrey sister had glutted the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecion Archipelago, on board one of his Majeftys vessels, in the year 1882, we put into the harbor of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of oattle and vegetablcs always to be had there, induce many British vesselsta visit it—bolb men of war and merchantmen; and though it Iics rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bovnties completely repay for the deviation of a voyage. We laridcd; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the meri were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cottle with the nationals, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the caveoalled Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his selucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said to be Greek ,\"arid would have taken me with him; but I did not have a chance to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gavoDominick, the wirie-trador, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though riotconstantly; sor he said in hisfelucca very often to the disferent islands .\"\nThis account excited over curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old mori, who conducted us over the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting floor, and a bed-room, with a spacious closot annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain greeri-stained walls, mclrble tab les on either side, a large myrtle in the ceritre, and a small futon beneoth, which could be made to play through tho branobes by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venvs in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and is empty book-case: there were no mirrors.\nerrors, nor single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffedcotton qullts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the silting-room we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were there in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileaus, and Rousscau works complete; VolneysRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstook's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of Robbers; Milton Paradisc Lost, an Ital-\nAi odition, printed at Parma in 1810; severol fmall pamphlets from the Greek press al Constantinople, much torri, but an English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said ho ,\"there they must lie until his return; far he is a particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon mc for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a servico; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechlncs which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small ootlage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house really was pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces long and forth broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plintbs and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grocian architecture ,) were considered higher than the raof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of a strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus surnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings on smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lacbryma Christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stroamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were elustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornainental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" forhe was very devout ,\" and always att-\nended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eyes to Mounl Calclo, covered with olive and myrtlc trees on the blooin, and an summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken oascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, arid an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminatos the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesriut cland palm-trees, several small islands were dislinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a joke more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless as to the narne of the person who had resided in this romantic society: none knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\" could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had participated in eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial seat. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and a catton arid silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mltylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He hod inoney it was evident: hod philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Failing in a cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"ahoul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him city Mitylene.\" We never heard of his lordships the same, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the cause of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believe it is not quite uninteresting, and Iri justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to assocjating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soath its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in bis lordship poems, seem to have their scat in his bosom. Tendemess, sympathy, and charity clppear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reasori sor marking hiin as a being on whose heart Reljgion hath set her sea, clnd over whose head Benevolerice hoth thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reparts are ever to be rec-\neived with action, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful trial where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of this genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applaus e, is the surest testimony of a cl virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "33": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition version with this tale is a foreigner is a very general intho East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Chrislianity; and it has onlyassumed its present form sirice the division of the Lalin and Greek churohes; at which time, the idea beeoming prevalent, thala Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the existence of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrairie, where the helief existscd, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated,lost their strerigth, and speedily died of consumplions; whilst these huinan blood-suckers fattened—and theirvoins becarne distended to such a state of repletion, as to \nIn the Londori Journal, of March ,1732, is a serious, and, of course, credible content of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Modreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the plaee, they positively found unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain He yukke, named Arnold Paul, had heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a uampyre, but bad found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyres grave, and rubbing himself with his This precaution, however, did not prevent harm from becoming a vainpyro himself; sor, about twenty or thirty days after bis death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in the course of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from eorruption, and emilting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and badly of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This time, they cut off his head, burned his body, and throw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vompyrism, lost they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief, if that a person sucked hy a vampyro becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his lurn.\nct: Chief Bailies.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is very related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than only other instances which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed will in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A suggestion alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse fhall from its tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughler, sister, wife, At midnight drairi, the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforcc Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere thoy yet expire, Shall kna The flowers are wlthered on the stem. But one thing for thy crime must fall. The youngest, best belove of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must erid the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Whichfreezes over its lifeless blue; Thenwith unhallowed hand shall tear The tresscs of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorri Affectiori's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine ogny! Yet with their own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing toolh, and haggard Iip; Tben stalking to the sullen grave, Ga—and with Gouls and First rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey bas also introduced in his wild but beautiful paem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire curse of the Arclbian maid Oneiza, who isrepresented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocerice. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, lo which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon thif subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradilionary narralives illustralives of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove lt to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a nole, necessarily devoted to exploration, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the orie in mofl general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it,mado use of in various parts of the world d: as Vroucolocha, Vordoulacha, Gou, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations altendant upon a London writer, there appeared at the various parties of the thc leaders of the ton a novelman, more remarkable sor his si rigularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw the fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; a bull fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been acoustomed to vialent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face,whioh never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesly, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, inariy of the female hunters after notorie ty altempted to wiri his attentions, and gain, clt least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfter shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his woy But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female fex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtvous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a writing torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dreod of his singular character, or that they were moved by his appclrent hatred of vice, he was as often arn among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Avbrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thoughl il their duty merely take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the oare os mercenary subaterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with nature, and thought that vicc was thrown iri by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various caloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon hif entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, strjving which should describe with least truth, their lariguishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his salitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those uolumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very irnpossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of external statements, than thetacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidonce of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered lts ppoint to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romanee, and determined to observe the offspring of hls foricy, rather than the person before He became acquainted with him, paid him alteritions, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respeeting this singular character, who, lill now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take the same rapid steps in the career of vice towar ds pvttling themselves upon equality with the aged, arid not allowing them to app ear af if fallen from the skics, whenever scandalous intrigues are meritione They consented: arid Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him call the proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circulation waters.\nHlthcrto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthverif character, and now he found, thal, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motivation to his conducl. His companion was profuse of his liberally ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avbrey could only avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuovs, reduced to indigence by the inissortunes atlendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—tbese were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to walk in his lust, or to find bim still deeper in his iriiquity, he was This will, however, attributed by him to the greaterimportunity of the uicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous incident. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressive upori his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Auhrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which hif compan ion sought for the centres of all fashionoble vice; there he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his anlagonist, and then he lost even more thon he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he was entcred into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except In every town, he left the formerIy affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the sollt ude of a dvngcon, the fate that had drawn him withiri the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst being speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from this gambling table; but immedlately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the oonvulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, copable os coinbating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved to ruin all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hope his friend would give bim some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never accurred. Lord Rutbven in his carriage, clnd amidst the various wild and rich scenes 0s nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than hislip; and though Avbrey waf neor the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the correct excitement of vainly wishing to break thatmystcry, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey saon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time loft sight of his companiori; he left him in daily attendance upon the morriing circle of an Ilalian countess, whilst he went in search of the minerals of another illegal deserted city. Whilst he was thus erigaged, letters arrived from the En gland, which he opened with eager compassion; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; that others were from his guardions, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power refident in his companion, these seemed to give him fufficlent reason for the belies. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urgod, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of the servant, rendered his religious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adulters had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victory, the partner of his guilt, should be hurt from the pinnocle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that also those females whom had sought, apparently on account of their future, had, since his departure, throwri euen the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deform\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to correct the eye. He resolved to investigate some plausible pretoxt for abandoning him altogether, purpafing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by urinoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was conveying to work. upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chicfly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the run of an innocerit, though thougtless girl. Losing na time, he entered the apartmerit of Lord Ruthven, and abrvptly asked him his intontions with respect to the lcldy, informing him call the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that every night. Lord Rulhven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasiori; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seok other apartments, and calling Japan the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lardship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven Riext day merely sent hif servant to notisy his complete ossent to separation; bvt did not have any fuspicion of his plans having been soiled by Auhreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps toward Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the saded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden thernselves beneath the sheltering soil or many colovred lunch. Under the same roof as himself, existed a bcing, so beautiful and dolicate, that she might have formed the modol for a painter wishing to pourtray on carivass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any order to think which could belong to those who had nosouls. As she danced upon. the plain, or trippod along the mountains fixed , one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would exchange her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ionthe aftcri accompanied Avhrey in his search after antiquities, and the ostcn would the uriconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as lt were upon the wind, to the oager gaze of hiin, who forgot the lettors he had just decyphcred upon ari almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhlbit in thesun ray such delieately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excufe the frogfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vitalimportance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all seem, but none can appreciate ?— It was inriocence, youth, and heauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stuffing balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning ta subjects that had evidently made a great expression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her carnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at She detailed him with the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time, who wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belies in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrastod with all the lhe asfected virlues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision ofromance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of oyoung man of English hablts, marrying an unedvcated Greek girl, still to find himself inore and more atlached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruiris around him, which in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was conscious of his love, and was ever the same srank infantile being he had a sirst kriown. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragments which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain hjm for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged off him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the re sort of te vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their poth. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus that mock a superior, infernal pawer, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy space of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belicf of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ore night allowed the power of these things to be put in action ;— he promised. He wos, however, so occupled in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon. there was one of those specks which, iri, the warmer climate, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at least, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southorn climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there is a bad advanced far, the power of the storm wos ahoue—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its woy through the canopying foliage, whilst the hlvc forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very effect. Suddenly his horse took sright, arid he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal clt last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fourid, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which furrounded it. Leaving, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide a bim to the towri, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storin. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a womon mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in onc almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled ovor hls head, he, with a sudden efforl, sorced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he collled, the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh fucceeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seomed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: be was lifted from hjs foet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his cnemy threw himself upon him, and knee The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon beard by those without. They entered; the thick light of their lorches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again Ieft in darkness; but what was his horror, where the light of the torches once moro burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduclress through a lifeless course. He shall hisoyes, hoping that it was but a vision clrising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, slretched by the bis side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan her lip; yet there was a ftillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the lise that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire! o compare !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to bim the object of so many bright and scary visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dclgger or a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were incon solcible; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in this inlervals he would call upon Lord Ruthvenand upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the hearing he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, happened at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever move, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrifiod and startled at the sight of him whose image he had nowcombined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, hy his kirid words, implying almostrepentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and fear which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordsbip seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apothetic being who had so ostonished Aubrey; but as saon as his oanvaloscence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed inleritly upon him, with a smile of maliciovs exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile  During the last stage of the invalid recouery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wavef raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— irideed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, wos much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much o lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athons; if he sought it in the woads, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modost violet; lhen suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her palc face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bulletin associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbuen, who was held himself bound by the tendor care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot lo which a reeollection could be attached: but though they thus haslened from the place place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They hoard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the inventior of individuals, but the interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecling the advice of the inhabitants, on the original occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than class a defence. Upon entoring, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they hadreason to repent their negligerico; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the wbistling of bullets close to their heads, arid by the cchod report of several gvns. Iri instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shauts bade thcm advance, arid being exposed to unresisting flaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and toke them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a school in the shouldor, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was found surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great review.\nard, Aubrey soon induced them to conuey hls wourided friends to a neighhouring eclhin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—thcy being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvcns strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conducl arid appearance had not changed; he seemed as uncorifcious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the ol ose of tho last evening, his mind became apparently uncasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to for his assist with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may have me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of a rny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save iny honor, your friend's honaur. \"—\" How? The tellrne, how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I — I — but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violenee ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by your natural fears, swear that, for a year arid a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in one way, whatever may happen, or whatever you must see. \"— His eyes seemed hurting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rost, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his ocquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his clutch, a cold sbivering came over him, or if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, arid informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and oomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighboring mount, according to a promise they had given a hls lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after bis death. Avbrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit to find a trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though two robbers swore, they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, my mind was bewildered in the pictures, but be at least returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to beighten that superstitious melancholy that had sejzed upon bis min d, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a cl vessel to convey hirn to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himsels, iri arranging those effects he held with him belonging to Lard Rvthven. Ainongst other things there were a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adopted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagharis. Whilst turning them out, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sbeath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fat al hut—he shuddered—hastoning to gain further proos, who found the weclpan, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held on his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splondour on both, and left no rooin sor doubt; there were also drops of bloodon each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on this way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrars; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantho. He became inorose and silent; and his only oecupatiori consisted of urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the loss of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seomed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the rnansion of his fathers, and thore, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri the embracos and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine carefses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as an acoination.\nMiss Auhrey had not that winning grace, which gains the game and the appearance of the drawing-roorn assemblics. There was none of that light brilliancy which originally exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. Thore was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soulconscious of a brighter recall. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and expensive. When alone, her space was never brigbtened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breatbed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, what would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as ifthose eyes — that fate were then playing in the touch light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her mother returned from the coritinent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the noxt drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Your eyes would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the mclancboly which ouerpowered hlin. He could not feel interested in the frivolities offashionable strangers, when his mind had been so tornby the events he had witnessed; that he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. The food arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was exercised— a drawing room had not been held for a long time, arid all who were anxious to book in the smell of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engagod in the rememhrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly sounded by the arrn, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly courage to turri, foarful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when being perceived, at a cl little distance, the same figure which had attracted this notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, arid was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and he xed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him— circumstances started up in dreadfularray—the dagger—bis oath .— He raused himself, who could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conj-\nured up the image, his mind was really upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determinod, therefore, to go again into society; for though he agreed to ask the econcerning Lord Ruthven, the riame having upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went to a cold a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, tumed round, and reached him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried ftep, forced her towards the street: at the door he fourid himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did nat dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before a high mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much morecompletely was it engrosso d, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attenlions were now unheeded, and it was in vairi that she intreated him to explode to her what had caused a abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and that terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His boat startled him ;—was he then to allow this monstro to raam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all beld deor, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he was able to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, which saw no one, and clte only when his sister or came, wha, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no langer capable of bearing stilncss and solitude, he loft his house, roamed from street, anxious to fly that image which haurited him. His dress became neglected, and he waridered, as often exposed to the Sunday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the euening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever the fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of w hose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into soclely, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so slriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought praper to interposc, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alleriated, they thought it was a high time to resume clgain that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving bim from the injuries and sufferings be had daily ericountered in this wanderings, and of preventing him from expasing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constarit care of this. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy tissue ;— the orily sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely affected her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True !\" and again he sank into a state, because not even she could rouse him. This lasts many months: gradually, however, if the ycar was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardions observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful o situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly, Aubreys attentian was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desiring to sec his sister. They answered not, but in four minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to oongratulate ber upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who bod so long influened his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he was thus destrayed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked cls if he did riot understand her—theri seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantie expression of countenance, he bade hcr swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought that was but a return of his disorder, entered, arid for cing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insonity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily undorstood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concelled from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and interest in his sate, which gradually won the lhc ear of Miss Aubrey. Who would resist his power? His tongue had dangers on toils to recount—couldspeak as himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to wham he addressed himself ;— could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of prescrvation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— in fine, he knew to well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; il was given him; he wrote a letter to his fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who had held her in their arms as their bope and the bope of their house, to delay but for a few hours thal marriage, on which to denounce the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver just; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would be better only to harass any more the mind of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concerned than described, the notes of a busy preparalion. Morning came, and the found of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He soized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment sourid himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord. Ruthven was the first to receive him: he immediately approached, and, laking his arm by sorce, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Rutchen whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendance, but, roused by the old woman, had come in the face of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken blood-uossel, arid he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was some-\nnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effustion of blood produced symptoms of the real approach of death. He desired if sister guardians might be called, arid when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians had a tendency to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it would look late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubreys later had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before for him, where to choose a shift place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18 l 2, we pvt into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vossels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; arid though it lies rathor out of the lrack for ships bound to Smyrna, its bountief mainly repays for the deviation of the cl voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bill, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ido (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Sclo with an English lard, but left the field four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have a takon line with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different fields .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much and welost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an eritranco hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet unnexed. They were all sirnply decorated: pIclin green-stained walls, mar ble tables on either sido, a large myrtle iri centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by maving a spring fixed on the side of a sinall bronzo Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nora single painting. The bedcbamber had merely a large mattress spread the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common hed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's closet in the closet: it was operi, but we did not think ourselves justied in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerinan, Iri Germanlanguage; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several fmall pamphlets from the Greek press at Constanlinople, much tom, but no English book Most of these books were silled with margirial noles, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiab was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books, the evening before he sailed, and forgol to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he isso particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did hjm a service; and I have the produce of thisfarm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cotton in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now temporary in Grecian architecture ,) were considered higher than the roses. ct: The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong eoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustering together on its barders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, an which we were told, the lord passed the mariy of his evenings and night till twelve o'clock, rcading, writing, and talking lo himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended your church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, eovered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as gloss, and ari hrizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiratef the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chefnut and palm-lrees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerad green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as that the name of the person who had resided in this romantic salitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armeniari,\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he willnot ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolatod lord. He had pounded eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial seat. He gave a cow to one man, horses to fathers, and cut ton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In the soul, it appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which over an old friend at the bottle thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genjus. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I made him in my trip to Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had neuer then beard of bis lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calclcl on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more ourious in our research at the cottage, but we cansoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return n. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in spite of his lordships, a good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of ari unfeeling dispositiori, averse to assooiating with a brain riature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly thereverse, as may be plainly gathered from those little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion shall sel her soal, and over whose bead Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding playing \"traits\" without feel-\nbeing proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with attention, particularly when directed against moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awfultribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, arid, but the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "34": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is sourided is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itsels to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present sorm since the division of Latin and Greek churcbes; at which time, the idea became prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with soineslight variation, also overHungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vompyres nightly imbibeda cortain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and specdily died of consumption; whilst lhese human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to suoh a state of repletion, as to cave the blood ta flow from\nIri, the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of uampyrism, which is slated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they pofitivcly and unanimously affirmod, lhat, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, hod bc heord to say, that, at Cossovja, ori the srontiers of tbc Turkish Service, he bad been tormented by a vampyre, hut had found a way to rid himself of the evil,  This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his doath and burial, many people complained about being tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been depriued of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the hody, and found it (as issupposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, clnd entirely free from corruption, and emitting a tbo inouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorled to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the board and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his bead, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, left they should, in their time, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe uni-\nThe verbal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observalions than any other instance which could be adduced. Iri many ports of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after dealing, for soine heinous crime comrnitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, class, vampire sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy raee; There srom thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must fced thy livid l living corsc, Tby victims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best beloued of all, Shall blefs lhee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thov must end the task and mark Her cbeeklast linge—her eye 1st spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless bluo; Then with unhlowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in lifo a lock when sborn Affections fondest pledge was worn—But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yel with thine owri best blood shall drip; Thy gnafhing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shririk away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southoy has also introduced in his wild bvt beauliful poem of \"Tha1aba,\" the vampyrecorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she must loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have a result of the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenee. The veracious Tovrnefort gives a Iong account in his travels of several astonlishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illuftrative of ils effects, bas put forth some learned dissertotions, tending to prove lt to be a classical, as well asbarbarian error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be cldded; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyrejs the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made us of in various parts of the world: Cls Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissjpations attendant upon a London winner, the re appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted high attention, that he listened to a look quell, and threw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. those who folt this sensatian of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flxing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pieree lhraugh to the inward workirigs of the heart; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; a call wisbed to fee him, and those who had been aecustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of erinui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of aging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gairied a warmer tint, eitber from lho blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passlon, though its form clrid outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of everymonsler shewn in drawing-rooms since her rnarrioge, threw But though the common adultress could not inflvence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife arid innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed bimsolf to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and whetber lt was that it even overeame the dread of bis singulor character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among t hosc femoles who form the boast of their domestic uirtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young German tleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it would be merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to take care of mercenary subaltems, be cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the palriters eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, long fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, mariy mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least through their languishing or romping favourites: lhe doughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he clapproached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talent and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tall and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, bul srom want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasingpictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe wotched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man consciously absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit accent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: cllowing hif imagination to picture everything that flattered its proposition to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offering of his fclncy, rather than the person before him. He becameacquainted with help, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, still now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardiclris, that it was tiine for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towclrds putting themselves upori an equality with lhe oged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sklef, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as They consented: and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of csteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other mcn, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had a hadno opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to hisview, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives at his conducl. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could riot avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduoed to indigence by the mlffortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beslowed his alarm ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed fnoers; but whon the profligate oomc to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or lo sink him still deepcr in his iniquity,  This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably fourid that there was a curse upon it, so they were all either lcd to the scaffold,or sunk to the lowest and the most abiect misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubreywas surprised at this apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres ofall fashlonable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: hc betted, and always gambled with success, except where tho known sharper was his antagonisl, and then he lost evon more than he gclined; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the fociety around: it was not, however, so when he encauntered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; their very wish scemed fortune's law—this apparent obstraotedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyef sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dclllying with the half-decld mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, lom from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the slitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fi end; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present crauing. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; bul immediately lost, to the ruiner of rnany, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his srierid, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, waf always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosily, he obtained no greater gratification from it. lhan thought the excitement of val only wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaled imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rame, and Aubrcy for a time last sight of his conclusion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst we went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst he waf thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonjshed him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him a susficient reason for the belief. If guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged him, his character was deliberately vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society.\nthe text. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his demilism, the partner of his gvilt, should be burled from the pinriaele of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sirie, that oll those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their uirlue, hcld, since his departure, \nAubrey determinedupon leaving one, whose choraoter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstonoes closely unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged tocarry on his plans in secrel; but Avbreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the origin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing or not e, to say, that from lhat m oment, he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed to ur, he ordered hls servant to soek other opartments, and ealling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day they sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separalion; but did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been followed by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon sound himself at Athens. He then fixed his rosidence in the house of a Greck; and saon occupied himself in tracing the faded record of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before leaves, had hidden themselves beneath the shellering soil or many coloured liehen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for Cl painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of being faithful in Mahomets poradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain fide, one would have thought the gazelle was a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe osten accompaniedAubrey in his search aster antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty ofber form, floating as just were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an almost effaced tahlet, in the contemplation of ber sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray sucb delicatcly brilliant and swlftly fading hues, it might well excvse the forgelfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind to very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but the line can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilft he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve an inemorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his penci 1, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circle dancing upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colors of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjocts thal hcidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all Her earnestness and appclrent belief af what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; clnd often as she told him the tale of the liuing vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and deorcst ties, sorced every year, by seeding upon the life of a lovely semaleta proloring his existence for tbe enfuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of She detailed him the traditional appearance of three monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey bogan to attack himself more and more to Ianthe; her irinocence, f0 contrasted with all the afsecled virtues of the women omong whom he had sought sor his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he criticized the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attaehed to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; hut he always found it impossible to fix his attentiori upon the ruins around bim, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightsulpossefsor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frarik infantile being had the first kriown. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; hut it was because she had no longer clny one with whoin she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardjan was occupjed iri sketching or uncovering some fragments which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they thought, with several present, afflrmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a word, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon anyconsideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the inost heavy ovils as pending upon him who dared to cross their path. Avbrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thvs to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrcy set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the rnelancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a lerror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in the warmer climates, to rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but just was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almasl unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: andere he had advanced far, the power of lbe storm was aboue—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval ofrest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate clt his very feet. Suddenly, his horse looked fright, and he was worried about the dreadful ropidity through the entangled forest. The animal at least, though fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of li thing, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the towri, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thvriders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exutant mockery of a lough, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled out his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the drow of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found hirnself incontaet with some one, whoin he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh svcceed; and felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: deterinined to sell his life as deorly as he could, he slruggled; bvt it waf in vain: he was lifted from hls feet and kneeling upon his broast, The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapablo of moving, was soon heard by those without. They eritered; the light of their tarches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the desire of Aubroy they searched for her who had attracted him by her ories; he was again left in darkness; but what was hls horror, whon the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He should his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he closed them, stretched by his side. The ere wcls no colour upori ber cheek, not even upan her lip; yet thore wasa stillness aboul her face that seemed almost as attaching as that life that once wed there :—upon her neok and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneouslyslruck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A letter was quickly forined, and Aubrey waf laid by the side of her who badly ately been to him the object of so mariy brigbt and sairy vlsions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a riaked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, sorewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the care. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a moft violent fever, and was often delirious; in these iritervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by soine uncountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chancedat this time to arrive at Athenf, and, from whatever motive, upon the bearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became hisstont attendent. When the latter recovered from bis delirlum, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whoso image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separatiori, and still more by their attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemedquile chariged; he no longer appeared thal apathelic being who had soastonished Aubrey; but af soon as his eonvalescerice began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same structure of mind, and Avbrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meot his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malieiousexultation playing upon his lips: he knew riot why During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Rulbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri mclrking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the maveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distriguished him now seemed to have fled far here. He waf now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rvthven; bvt much as he wisbed for solitude, his mind could not sing it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he saught it almost ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthes form slood by his side—if he foughl it in the woods, her light stop wauld appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would fhow, to his wild imagination, her pale face arid wounded throat, with a more smile upon her lips. He determined to play scenes, every feature of which created such better associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of himduring his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They trauelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recycling could be attacked: but though they thus he satened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excute the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabilanls, on the original occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than of a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrenl, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring preciplces, they had reasori lo repent their negligence; for scarcely were the wbole of the party engaged in the nclrrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling af bvllets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of scverol guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, arid, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, limiting their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defil e: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade lhem advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they deterinlried at once to reach forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubreyhastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the cantest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Heaven being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wouri ded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he will no more distvrbed by their presence—they being coritent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade shauld return with the promised sum, sor which he hadan order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days martification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty sleep. His conduct and appearanceanco had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was indvced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save mc—you may do more than that — I moan not my life. I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I carinat explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried thodylng man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their focus :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances atlending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered bis oath a cold shivering camo over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and iriformed him that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighboring mount, aceording to a promlse they had given his lordship, that il should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his doath. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it says. But, when he had mounted to the summil, he faurid no trace of either tbe carpfe or blue clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently confpired to hcighten that superstitious melclncholy that bad seized upon his mind, hc resolved to leave just, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with whom belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of defence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and colleagues. What turning thcm over, and examining their various forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain surther proof, he found the woapon, and his harrr may be imagined when he discovered that it filted, though poouliary shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the sarne varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no roam for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquirief were concerning the lady he hadattempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive orts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune hurried, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Auhrey's rnd became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed absent to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared tolose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, her non-nine caresses, had clincd his affectiori, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and appearance of the drawing-room consists. There is none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind, but. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misforturie, but from some feeling within, that appeclrod to iridlcale a soul consciousness of a brighter realrn. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a calour may attract — it was sedate and perisive. When anyone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy, but when ber brother breathed to ber his affection, arid would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his resl, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the victory? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Shc was yet only a ighteen, and had not been presented to the world, itbaving been thought by her guardjans rnore fit that ber presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might beher protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the real drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy sceno\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed upon the inelancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he badly witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for them the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room hod riot was held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of all around him, changed in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Rulhven walls in that very place — he fell himself sudderily seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hard courage to lurn, searsul of seeing a spectre that would beat him, where he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice ori his spot upori his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to lake the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried feet, and fixed his handsupon back head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were hurting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances startod up in a dreadful array—the daggcr—his oath .— He rovsed himself, he could nat believe it possible—the dead rise agoin !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upori. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into a society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Loaving her under the production of a matron, he retired into a recession, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at lost, that many were leauing, be roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by soveral, apparently in the oarnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurr ied step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself lmped by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing lhem, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Rem-\nRemember your boat !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon r reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was influenced, now that the cortainty of the monstcrs Iiving agairi pressed upon his thoughts. His sisters' attention was now unhceded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her. what should cause his abrupt conduct? He only uttered a cold few words, and those tcrrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildcred. His oath stortled him ;— was then to allow this morister to roar, a roaring rulri upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? This very sifter might have been touched by him. Bul even if he were to break bis oath, and lose his suspicions, who would believe him? Ho thought of employing a hif owri hand to sree the world from such cl wrelch; but death, heremembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, who saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughl him, for her sake, to support nature. At least, no longer capable of hearing stillness and solilude, he left the bis house, roamed from street to strict, arixious to fly that image which haunted him. This dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damp. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the euening to the house; but at least he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. This conduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that he lefl by bis absence the whole of bis friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to eriter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarri, iri fpite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approahed with intjacy. But when he entered into o room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderingf so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, o fociety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstranoe proved uriavailing, the guardioris thought proper to interposo, and, foaring that his mind was bocoming alienatod, they thought it had a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from blue injurles and sufferings he had daily encountered in hif wandcrings, and of prev enting him from exposing to the general eye lhose marks of what they considered folly, they erigagod a physician to reside in the house, and take the eorislant corc of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, a computer was also absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great eat, that he was confused to hif the chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. Hc had become emacjated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of hif sister; then hc would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch her. \"Dh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" Whori, bower, she inquired to whom hereferred, his only answer was ,\"True! True!\" arid again, he sank into a stote, whether not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, bowever, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mirid threw off a portion of its glaom, whilst his guardians observod, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a defi-\nnite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, begari to canverse with his physician upon the rnelancholy oircumstonce of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Mclrsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astoriished them still more than his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of bcr brothers being once more alive to the feelings of afsection. Hc began to speak with all his worried warmth, and to correct her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and evory aceomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surpriso at bringing the features of the morister who had so long inflvenced his life. Besides, the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon being asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblarice of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarice, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, sor ho — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again badly. him remember his health — he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no once. In the meantime, the guardians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He follows upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged the need of them to delay but for the correct day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrcy's illhealth, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former company, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hif tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of anindividual having no sympatby with any being on the c rowded earth, save with her to whoin he addressed himself ;—covld tell how, sjnee he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were morely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpenls art, or such was the will of fate, The title of the eldor branch falling at long to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excvse far haftening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged status ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure far the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe both servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, bcr her own honour, arid the horror of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on when he denounced the most heavy cursef. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any other mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy members of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than doscribed, the noles of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was the amount of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were necessary. Lord Ruthven was the first person to perceive him: he immediately app-\nroached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, specchless with rage. When on the slaircafe, Lord Ruthven whispered his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his ottendants, who, roused by the old woman, had some in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not sending a cell, had broken a blood-suessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when I entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreysweakness increased; the esfusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians rnight to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrcy; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nA COMUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose this place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sajling through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mityleno, on the island of that name. The body of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, introduced many British vessels to visit it—bothmen of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rat her out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bourities amplyrepcly for the deviation of the cold voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek cls over guide, who told us he bad come from Scio with an English lord, who lest the island four days prior to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to get married. He is an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and he resided there about fourteen months, though not conslantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different rent islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly recolved by a clean old mari, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlaur, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large temple in the centre, and a small fountain benca-\nth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small hronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chalrs, and an empty book-cafc: thereworc no mirrors, riar a single pai-\nThe painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the commori bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-roam we observed a marble reooss, formerly, the old inan told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chesl in the closet. It was open, but we did not think ourselves jvstified in explaining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Roufseau works complcte; VoIney Ruins of Ernpires; Zimrnermari, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novos; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Porma in 1810; seueral small pamphlets from the Greek press at Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with a pencil, in Italian arid Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these hooks lhe evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that I wore to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he is always very good. I once did hjm a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adriariople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico infront was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pillars and fret-work cornlces ,( as it is now customary in Grecian arcbilecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are this fumished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian eclecting fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were cluftering logether on its bordors, clnd under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamental wooden back was planted, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve clocks, reading, writing, and talkingto himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very doubt ,\" and always attended over church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covered with olive and myrtle troes iri bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream jssuing from the ruins descended in the rokon cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew bis riame but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not tell ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said be ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit this Armenian, but on our return to the towri we learnt several participants of this isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and everyone danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cowto, one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who lost hisown in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to the poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from call we collecled, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend of the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had the most beautiful doughter, with whom the lord was osten seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mjtylene.\" We had never ever heard of his lordships fine, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mityleno on some future daily; but to me that day will deliver a return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justiee to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been deserihed as of urifeeling disposition, aired to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly thereverse, as may be only gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer seelings of the heart, so elegantly deplected in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in the hif bosom. Tenderness, sympalhy, arid charily appear to guide all his actions: and his oourling the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him class being on whose heart Religiori hath set her sea, and our whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mant-\nlike .. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of her as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are eager to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and sbun the world's applause, is the secret testimony of cl virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleel-street.",
    "35": "THE VAMPYRE;\nThe table.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Amazing! the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; clnd it has orily assumed its present from since the division of the Lotin and Greek churches; at which time, the ideo hecaming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and healing. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorrajne, where the belief existed, that vampyrcs might indeed be a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-\n-suckers fattened — and their levels became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, on March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of cl partlcular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in English. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magiftrales of the plclce, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, thal, at Cassovia, on the frontjers of the Turkifh Servia, who had been tormenled by a vampyre, but had sound a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating soine of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty dclys after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition wcls made, that four persons had been deprived of life by bis attacks. To prevent the surther mischief, the inhabitants having corisulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be useful in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, fever and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accusation remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, but which he is reported to have cried out as dreodfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his bead, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same increases were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrisn, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survive them.\nThe universal belief is that a persori sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre bimself, and sueks in his turn.\nct: Chief Bailies.\nThis monst rous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than arily other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sorl of punishment afterdeath, for some being ous crime eommitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to eonfine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon eorth—those to whom he was bound hy ties of kindrod and affection .— A supposition alludod to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb he rent; The ghostly haunt lbe native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy dclaughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streorn of life; Yet loalhe the banquctwhioh perforoe Must feed thy livid living corse, Thyvictims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best beloved of all, Shall blefs thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end by task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—hereye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unbalowed hand shall tear The tissues of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock when shorn Affections fondest plodge was warned — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the stolen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Asrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaha\", the vampire curse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grove for the purpose of contacting him, she best loved whilst in existence. Bul this cannot be supposed to be refulted from the sinfulness of her life, she belng pourlrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The verac ious Tournefort gives a long account of his travels of several ast onishing cases of uampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and CaImet, in his great work upon this subjeot, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional riarrotives ilustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned disfcrtations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarlan error\nMany cvrious ond interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be cldded; though the present may suffice for the limit of a noto, receary devated to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, though the term Vampyre Js the one in most goneral acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parls of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attondarit upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the town of a nobleman, more remarkable for hissingularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted her attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fi xing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the beart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peouliaritief caused him to be invited to every house; all wjshed to see him, and those who had been aecustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, wero plssed as having something in their presence capable of engaging their attenlion. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which neuer g ained a warmer tinl, either from the blush of modesty, or from the slrongemotion of passian, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the scmclle hunters after notoricty attempled to win his atteritions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term asfection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of overy monsler shewn iri drawing- But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was iridifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few kriew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the repulation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moued by his parent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form the bast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an organ left with only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Loft also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which d aily ruins of many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though that vice was thrown iri by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of this scene, as we sce in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted of the vesting of elothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured clothes. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances who he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon looked at him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starlled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snufsing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and defcriptions contained in lhose volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his grammar.\nlified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above doscribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibi lity of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed ln bimscif, who gave a few other signs of his observation of exlernal objects, tban the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allawing his imagination to picture euery thing that flattered its propensity to extravagarit ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his price was always recognised. He gradually learnt that LordRuthven affairs were einbarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some infarincltion respecting this singular character, who, still now, hod only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardioris, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever fcandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of ploasantry or of They conerited: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Thorn, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flallered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in a company with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the crocling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had held no opportunity to study with Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to be conducted. His companion was profuse in this liberality ;— the idle, the vagobond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid rernarking, that it was not upon thc virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortvnes attendant even vjrtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sonl from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vioious, which gonerally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous instinct. There was one conversation about the cbority of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it waf bestowed, ultimately found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either lod to thescaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which lhey passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centre of the faro table: he betted, and alwoys garnhled with success, except where the known shclrper was his antagonist, clnd then he lost even more than he gained; but jt was always with the same unchanging foco, with which he generally wated the society around: it was not, however, so when he enclered In every town, he left the sormerly affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungean, the fate that had drawn hiin within the reach of this friend; whilst many father fat sranlic, amidst the speaking looks of much hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even susficient to satisfy their present craving. Yethe took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, the laft gilder had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innoeent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was nat, however, capable of cornbating the cunning of the more experienced. Avbrey oston wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign to charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he helped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lard Ruthven in his carriagc, and amjdst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his ljp; ond though Aubrey was near the object of his curlosity, he obtairied no greater grotification from it than tbe constant excitement of vainly wifhing to break that mystery, which to hjs exalled imaglnation hegan to assumc the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his cornpanion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memories of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lettersarrived from England, which he opened with eagor impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonisbed him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in bis oompanion, these seemed to give him a sufficierit reason for the bellef. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, roundered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultresf had not originated in a batred of ber eharacter; but that he had required to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, shauld be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: ln flne, that all those semales whom he had soughl, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to correct the eye. He resolved to invent some plausiblo pretext for obandoning him altogether, purposing, in the Korean while, to watch them more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon pereeived, that his Lordship was endeavoring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly froquented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thereforeobliged to carry on his plans in secr et; but Aubreys eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an lnnocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthveri, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the fame time that he Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would haveupon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he was iritended to marry her, merely loughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the rcmaindor of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the other of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. ct: The assignaliori was proven. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his agent to riotify his complete absence to separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plaris having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded record of ancient glory upon mo numents that apparently, ashamed of chroriicling the deeds of freemen only be for slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or inany coloured lichen. Under the sclme roof as hell, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have forrned the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on oanvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradlso, save lhal her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the table plain, or tripped along the movement-\najns side, one would have thought the gazelle of poor type of her becluties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the castle of an epicure. The light step of Iarithe oflen accompanied Aubrey in hif search after antiquities, clnd often would the unconscious girllerigaged in the pursuit of a Kashmero butterfly, show the whole beouly of ber forrn, floating as il were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of hjm, who forgot tholotters hc had just decypheredupon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses fcllling, as shc flitted around, exhihit in the sun ray such dclicately brjlliant and swiftly fading hues, just might well excuse the forgelfulness of the antiquary, who lel oscape from hls mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage iri Pausanias. But why attempt to describe characters which all fall, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocenco, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a mernorial for his suture bours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in lracing the scenes of her native place; sbe would then describe him the circlering dance upon tbe open plain, would pairit, to him in all theglowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in hcr infancy; and thon, tvri-\ning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the spectacular tales of her nurse. Her earnestncss arid apparent belief of what sbe narrated, excited tbe interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the lale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frierids, and dcarest ties, forced euery year, by foeding upan the life of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frierids, and dcarest ties, forced euery year, by foed She detailed to help the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted inpersuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supematural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attack himself more arid more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of this woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he rldiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greck girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, farming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, delermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impassible to fix bis attention upon this rvins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone to be the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was conscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being held first known. She always seemed to part from him with aluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied insketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents from the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his exeursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him nol to retum at night, as he must recessarily pass through a wood, where rio Greck would ever remain, after the dcly had closed, upon only consideration. They described it as the resort of the vainpyres in their nocturnal orgles, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to eross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh thern out of the idea; but wheri hc faw them shudder at his daring, thus ta moek a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood froeze, hc was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattonded; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his boss, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the bolief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the barjzon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a lremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, delermined to make up the hy speed for bis delay: hutit was too late. Twilight, in these southem climcltes, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—itsechoing thunders had searcely an iriterval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced ils way through the canopying folioge, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate al his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hotel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woinari mingling with the stifled, exultant mockcry of a laugh, continuod in one cluster unbroken sound ;—he was starlled: but, roused by the lhurider which again rolled over his hecld, he, with a sudden efforl, foreed open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone who he immediately said; wben a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh fucceeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, bad placed The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by her crles; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchef once moro burst upon hirn, to perceiue the airy form of his fair conductress broughl in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbance; he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. Tberc was no colour upon hor cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a slillness about her face that scemed almost as attaohiring as tbe life that once dwe lt there :—upon her neck and breaft wcls blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this meri polnted, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of beer who had lately been to him the object of some bright and fairy visions, now selling with the flower of life that had died within a car. He knew not what his thoughts were—bis mind was benumbed and sent to shvn reflection, arid take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked daggor of a particular construction, which had been found in this hut. They were soon made by different parties who had been engaged in the seclroh of her whom a mother had risen. Their language cries, as they approached the city, sorewarried the parents of some cruel catastrophe. — To describe their griof would be impossible; but when they ascerlained the cause of their child death, they looked at Aubrey, and painted to the course. They were inconsculble; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with a most violent fever, and waf often delirious; in these intoruals he would call upon Lard Rulhven and upon Ianthc—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the lhe being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictiaris upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever mative, upon hearing of the stale of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his conslant attendont. When the latler recovered from his delivery, he was horrified and slartled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with tbat of a Vampyrc; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their seporation, and still more by the attention, anxicty, and care which he showed, soon reconciled hlm to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changod; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Avbrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the sarne stato of mind, and Aubrey received no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to rent his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation plclying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless fun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the cyef of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had a desire so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and filenoe as Lord Ruthven; bvt much as he wished for solitvde, his mind would not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had farmerlyfrequentcd, Ionthe form stood by his side—if he shouted it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the urid erwood, in quest of the madest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter assoeiations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tendercaro he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to hear what they gazed upon. Theyheard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reparts, which they imagined were only the inuention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the gerieroslty of those whom they defended from prison-\nthe dead dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrcnt, with large inafses of rock brought down from the neighboring pr ecipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the wbole of the parly engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had been to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord. Ruthven and Avbrey, imitoting their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouls bade them advarice, and being exposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them into the rear, they delermiried at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Steven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastenod to his assislance; and, no longer hoeding the contest or his owri peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around h im—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthuens being wounded, immediately their own up their clrms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Avbrey foon indvced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade shouldroturn with the promised sum, for which he had an order. LordRuthvens fright rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance bad only changed; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and hif the eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to lose his assistance with more than usual oarnestness —\"Assist me! you may save ine—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existenceas little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of mc, my honour was free from stain iri the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall riot be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant uiolence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your natural fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my ores or death to only living boing in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursling from their sheets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rost, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold showering camo over him, as if from the prescliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising oorly in the morning, he was clbout to enter the hovel in which he had Ieft lhe corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, la the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his leadership, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey asto finished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury just upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trap of either the ropes or the clothes, though the robbers swore they poinled out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpso for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid iri which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious mearicholy that bad sounded upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Dtranto, or to Naples, he occupled himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, rnore or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dark glooms and taghans. Whilst tvrning thein over, arid examining their cvrious forms, what was his surprise at finding a fbeath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger disoovered in the fatal but—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need rio further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; bvt the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, arid on his way home, clt Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens scductive arls. Hor parents were in distress, their fortune ruinod, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and hif only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the postilions, as if we were going to solve the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the inansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her annetine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attoching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Hor blue eye was never lit up by the ability of this mind, beeath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a buttcrfly or a color may be altract — it was sedate andpensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breothed her affection, and would like her presence to forget those griefs. she knew he destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the country? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been preserited to the world. It has been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. I was riow, therefore, re solved that the next drawing room, which was the sast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed up with the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drowing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened the tbilher. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembranoe to the first time he had been Lord Rutbven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the room, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath\". He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he percelved, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his nolice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refufing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven horne. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array —lhe dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possiblo—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the imoge his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — be determined, therefore, to go again into society; for thought he ottempted to ask concerning Lord Rulhven, the name of hvng upon his lips, and he could only succeed in clining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the production of a matron, he retired into a process, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he rovsed himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, sorced her towards the street: at the door he found himself lmpeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; andwhile be waf engaged iri passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not daro to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon became bored.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by the orie subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living agcliri pressed upon hif thoughts. His sister's attitudes were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she wanted him to explain to hear what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oathstartled bim ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by the film. But evon was able to break his bath, and dis-\nclose this suggestion, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remairied in this state; shut vp iri his room, he saw no one, and the other only when his sister came, who, with eyes, streoming with tears, hesovghhlm, far her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and salitude, he left his house, roamed sram street tostreet, anxious to fly that imogo which hounted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the eueriing to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wore soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuor swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with int-\nthe imacy. But when he cntered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister walked at last huddering to bcg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which clffected him sa strorigly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming an alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parerils.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encounlered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposiing rig to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the h ouso, arid take instant care of him. Hc hardly appeared to notice it, so completely the whole mind absorbed by one terrible moment. His incoherone became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he walked a lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recolloction remaining displayed itself upon the eritry of his sisterlet. he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that surely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, some inquired to whom he referred, this only answer was ,\"Truo! t rude !\" arid again he sank into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This lasted many moriths: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his iricohererices became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon hif fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going to the next day to be married. Inftantly, Aubrey's attention was attracted; he called unxiously to whom. Glad of this lack of returning intellect, of which they searched for had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was cl young Earl whom he bad met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, arid astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his worried warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly received a cl locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the seats of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he badc her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord. Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard that whole, and thought this was but the clerk of bis disorder, enlered, and forcing him from Miss Avbrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees that thom, he ignored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attracting this to the insanity they imagined to take possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Avbreys illhealth, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deomed insane, his exutalion and pleasure could hardly be coricealed from those among whom he had gained this information. Hehastened to the house of his former companion, and, by conslant attendaneo, and the pretence of great affection for the brother arid interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an indlvidual having no sympathy with ariy being on the crowded earth, save with her lo wbom he addressed himsels ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it was merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serperits art, or such wos the will of fate, that The title of the older branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for bastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was giving him; hc wrote a call letter to bis sister, conjuring beer, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of lhosc now in the grave, who once held her in their arms of their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marrlage, on which he denouncod the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may be more easily conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and so tired of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grows almost frantic. The curiosity of the seruantf at last a vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly collapsed. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him immediately approached, and, taking his arrn by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthveri whispered his ear —\" Remember your oath, and kriow, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not meritianed to his sister, who was not present when he entered, the same physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired hls slstcrs guardians might be called, arid when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly whot the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardiaris hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was a toolate. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNTOF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE A SLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and provide nice his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the world 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of eattle and vegetables always to be had thorc, induce many British uessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lics rather out of the track for ships hound to Smyrna, its bodies amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, arid whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining far cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Idcl (a small monticule so named) we metwitb and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had carne from Scio with cln English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucco. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said Grcek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mjtylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of il: he gavo Dominick, lhe wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and bas resided there about fourleen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his fel ucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excjted our curiosity very much. and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our country had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It corrected four apartments from the graurid-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply docoratod: plain green-stained walls, marblc tables on the other side, a large myrlle in the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sosa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-class: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on this floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we abserved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think overseas justified in explaining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileauf, and Rousfeau works complele; Volney's Ruiris of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Coristantinople, much torn, but no English book of Most of these books were silled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Lalin. The Messlah was literally scrjbbled all over, and m arkod with slips of paper, on which also were marks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been rcading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to placc them with others; but,\" said he ,\"the three thcy must lic until his return; forhe is so particular, that where I lo move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm sor the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechincs which I paid to an agcd Armenian who resides in a small coltagc in the wood, and whom the lord probably herefrom Adrianople; I didn't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as just is now customary in Grocian architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. Tbe roaf, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine cherry carpet, boncath an warning of a strong coarse line n. Most of the house-tops are thus furnishod, cls upon them, the Greeks pass their euenings in smoking, drinking lightwiries, such as \"lachrymcl christi\", oating sruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stretch glded away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his ovenlings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and lalking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very depressed ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be terrned \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye toMourit Calccl, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades until it was lost in the woods near the mountain house. The sea smooth of glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termiriates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emeradgroen. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our eriquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: the friend knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenlan\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure which will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even drew with them at the national feast. He gave a cow to one man, harses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he aften gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very clever and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the college thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shorc, and he had bought a hor a pjanoforte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece couldhe. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposing, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"clbout whom you are so anxious Lord Byron; I met him in my trauels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of this lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the reoluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious about our research at the stage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lord ship a good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth lost sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in hisbosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his eourting the repose of solilude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whosc head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man cari read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where also must appear, alone may censure the orrors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is the world of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the suresl testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "36": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Poidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is a very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek Churches; at which time, the idea of becoming prevalent, that a Latin hody could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. Iri tbe West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who beeame emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptlons; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a crucial account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. Il appears that upon an examination of the commander-iri-chief and mogistrates of the place, they pofitively and unanimously affirmed, thal, about fivc yeclrs before, a certain Heyduke, namedArnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the fronticrs of the Turkish Service, had been lormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euil, by eating the same of the earth This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a varnpyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormerited by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischies, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagnj, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresh, and ontirely free srom corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and eors, pure and florid blood. P the roof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stroke was driven entry-\nely through the hearl arid body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out of dreadfully colds if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The samemeasures were adopted with the course of thase person who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here a relot-\ned, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observalings than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishment of death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but complicated to consinehis infernal visitations solely lo those beings he loved masl wbile upon earth—tbose to whom he was bound by ties of kindred arid affectiori .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut sirst on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from lhy daughter, slster, wifo, At midnight drain the stream of lifc; Yet loathe thc banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living c 0 rse, Tby victims, cre they yet expire, Shall  The flowers are withered on the sleam. But one that for the crime must fail, the youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shallwrap the hoart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's laft tinge—her eye laft spark, And lhe laft glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Thon with unhallowed hand shall tell the tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life o lock when shorn Affections fondest pledgc was worn — But riow is borne away by the lheo Memorial of the tyne agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Go uls and Afrits rave, TilI these in horror shrink clway from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre eorse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented after having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, sbe best looked at what in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the lale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Toumefort gives a long accourit in high travels of several astonlshing cases of vampyrism, to whichbe pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has pvt forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to have a elassical, as well as barbarian error.\nMariy curious and iriteresting riotices on this singularly horrible superftition might be added; though the present may susfice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the terin Vampyre is the one in most general acoeplation, there or several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &\nct: THE VAMPYR E.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon the cold London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the lon a nableman, more remorkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gave up the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance topierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but feel upon the cheek with a leaden ray thal weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. Hlf peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see hiin, and those who had been accuslamed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the brush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passlon, thaugh its form and outliric wore heautiful, many of the fernalc hunters aftcr notorlety attempted to win his clttentions, and gain, at least, some markf of what they might term affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the mockery of every rnoorns, and But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet suob was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. Ho had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whether it was that it even overcame the drad of his singular character, or that they were moved by hif apparent hotred of vice, he was as ofteri clmong those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virlues, as omong those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Avhrey: be was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by gvardians, who thought it their duty morely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the carc of mercenary subalterris, be cultivated more his irnaginalion than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought practice was lhrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we feel in romances: he thought that the inisery of a cottage merely consisted of the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patehes. He thought, long fine, that the dream of poets was the recllities of life. He wcls handsome, frank, and rich: sor tbese reasons, upon his enlering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least through their langujshing or romping favourites: the daughters at lhe sarnc time, by their brigbtening courages when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notlons of his talenls and his merit. Altached as he was lotbe romarice of his solitary hovrs, he started to find that, except in the tallow and wax eandles that flickered, nol from the prosence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congories of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his obsorvotiori of external objects, than the taclt assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their cantact: allowing hif imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this statement into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairswero embarrassed, and soonfound, from the notes of preparalion in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wbo, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the lour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapld steps into the career of vice towards pulting themselves upan equally with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasanlry or of praise, according They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioriing his intontions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, wba, apparently, had nothing in common with other meri, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling water years.\nHitherto, Aubrey child had an opportunity to study Lord Ruthvcn's character, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to hif view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was praised in his liberality ;— the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunes attendant even upan virtue, that he bestowed hjs alms ;—lhese werc scnt from the door with hardly suppressod sncers; but when tbe profljgate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow hlm to walk in his lust, or lo sink hiin still deeper in This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the previous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity and his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all the others led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the oentres of the faro table: he betted, and always garnbled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonisl, and then he last even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family\nhis apparent abstractcdries of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, tom from the circle he adorned, cvrsing, in the solilude of a dungeon, the fole that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, wit without a slnglc farthing of his Iate immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gombling toble; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convuiocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the running of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg hirn to resign that chority and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruth-Joy.\neven in his carriage, and amidst to various wild arid rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he oblainod no groater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break thal mystery, which to his exaltod imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily atten dance upon the morning circle of cln Italian countess, whilst he went in se aroh of the memor-\nthe details of another almost deferted city. Whilst he was having engaged, Ietters orrived from England, which was opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing hut affection; the others were from his guardians, the lclt tor aslonished hlm; if it had before entered into his imagination, there was an evil power resident in his companion,these seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisled upon his immcdially Ieaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrecislible powers of seduction, rendered his lieentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discoured that his contempt for the adultresf had not originated iri hatred of her character; bul that he had required, to enhance his gratlfication, thal hls victim, the partrier of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently onaccount of their virtue, had, since hif departure,\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hirn altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more classly, and to let rio slight circumstarices pass by unnoticod. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship would endeavour to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, just js seldom that an unmarried female is mot with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry ori his plans incorrect; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, arid soon discovered that an assig-\nthe nation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innoeent, thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that was aware of his being about meeting her that very nigbl. Lord Ruthven answered that hisintentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that rnoment, he must deeline accompanying hls Lordsbip in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calliring upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify hiscamplete ossent to a separation; but did not hlnt clny suspicion of bis plaris having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Periinsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Grcek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monumenls that apparently, ashamed of cbronicling the deeds of srecmon only before slaves, had hidden thomselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicatc, that she might have formed the modol for a painter wishing to pourlray on canvass the prornised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mirid for anyone to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dancod upon theplain, or lripped along the mountain si de, one would have thought about the gazeIle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for that sleepy Iuxurious look of the animal sultod but to the last of the ariepicure. The light step of Ianthe often acoomporiied Aubrey in his search after anliquities, and often would the unconsciaus girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly,show the whole beauty of her sorm, floating as it was upon the wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphcred upon an lmost effaced lablet, in the contemplalion of her sylph-like figure. Oft en would her tresses falling, as she flitted arourid, exhibit in the sun ray such delicatelybrilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the fargelfulness of the antiquary, wholet escape from bis mind, the very object which had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of cl passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe chorms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remairis of which he wished to preserve a memorial sor his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would their describe to him that circling darice upon the operi plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell her all the supernatural Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exciled the interest even of Avbrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prove his existence for the ensuing months, his b lood would ruricold, whilst being attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited him the  to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that thase who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord. Ruthven; he, however, still persisted iri persuading her, that there could be no lrutb in herfears, though at the same time he wondered at the many collegicences which had all tended to excitc a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to catch himself more and more to Ianthe; her i nnocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wori his heart; and while he ridlculed the idea of cl yaung man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, who would dopart, determined nal to return until his object was attained; but he always found just impossible to fix his attentiori upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful professor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile. being. he had first known. Sbe always seemed to part from him with a circle but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, offered their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few books; when they beard the name of the place, they all at the detain begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and deriounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Au Brey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently inade their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncably face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there might allow the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He wcls, howevor, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and lhat in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmcr climates, so rapidly gather inlo a tremendous mass, and pour all their ragc upon the devated country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: when he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an iriterval of roft—lls thick heavy rain forced this way through the canopying foliage, whllst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the oritangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtainshelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, lhe thunders, far a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful fhries of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was stclrtled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of a hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, a given him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone who he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\" Again baffled !\" to which a laudlaugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but he was in vain: ho was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat — when threw the hole that gave light irithe day, disturbed him ;—he instaritly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as ho hrokc through the woad, was no longer beard. The storm was still now; afraid Aubrey, incapable of moving, was found heard by those without. They eritered; the light of their lorches fell upon the mud, w alls, and the thatch loaded on every individual struck with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the ajry form of his fair coductress brought in a lifeless cross. He shuld his eyes, hoping that just was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost asattaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to thif the meri pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quicklyformed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to bim the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—hif the mind was benvmbed arid secmed to shunreflection, and took refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been fourid in the hvt. They were soon met by different participants who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, after they approached the eity, forewarned the parents of some dreadful oatastrophe. — That describe their grief would be impossible; but when they oscertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the force. They were iriconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often dollrious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccouritablo combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever inotive, upon hearing of the fate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and slartled at the sight of hiin whose image hehad now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentanco for the fault that had caused their separation, and slill more by attention, anxiety, and care wh which he showed, soon he recognized him to his present. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey pereoived na difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of rnalicious exvltation playing upon his lips: bc kriew not why, but his smile haunt During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in wotching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, near in marking the progress of those works, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distriguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mirid could not find it in the nejghbourhood of Athens; if he sougbt it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then sudderilyturning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagiriation, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crealed such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care which had taken of help during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought a very spot that which a corporation could be attached: but though they thus hastened from the place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the notion of individuals, whose interest it was to excute the generosity of those whoin they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a consequence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighhouring precipces, they had reason to reperit their negligence; for s carcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, wheri lhey were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their hcads, arid by the echoed report of several gunf. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Rulhuen and Aubrey, jmitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shocking turn of the defile: but ashamed of heing thus detained by o foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to urirosisting slaughter, if any of the robers should climb ab oue and take them in the reclr, they delermined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly hold they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey haslened to hisstance; and, no longer heoding the contesl orhls awn perll, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' forces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthuens being woundcd, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great rcward, Aubrey soon indvced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence merely to guard the entrance till their command should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveris strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed aduancing with hasty steps. His con ducl and appearance hod not changed; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objeots aboulhim: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eye ofton sixed upon Aubrey, who was induccd to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestnefs —\"Assist me! you really save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of a rny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but Iittle — my life ebbs apoce — I cannot explain the whale — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world inouth — and if my death was unknown for some lime in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultanl uiolence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature foarf, swear that, for a year and a day you will only impart your knowledge of my criines or death to only liviing being in any way, whalover may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed hurt from their sockets :\"I screw !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his boat, a cold shivering came over a ring, as if from the presentjment of something horrible awaiting a bim. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and iriformed him that it was no longer there, having been canveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighboring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonifhed, and taking several of the male men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, where he had donated to the sumrnit to find no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burned the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which oll apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seemed upon his mind, be resolved to leave it, and saon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranlo, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arringing those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Heaven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offenee, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath clpparently ornamented in the same stylo as lhe dagger discovered lri the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weoponland bis horror may be imagined when hc discovered that il fitted, though pecvliarly sbaped, the sheath hoheld in bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no surther certainly — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wifhed to dislike; but in particular form, the same varying tirits upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and lest no room for doubt; there wcro alsa drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had learned to snatoh from Lord Ruthven seductive arts. Her parents were indistress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been beard of since the departure of his scholarship. Aubroy's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of urgizing the speed of the profits, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breoze, which seemed abedient to help will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a mother, appeared to lose, in the embraces and carelessness of his sister, all the memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his offeotion, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze around the applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was a line of that Iight brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowdod apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the light of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about the film which did not seem to clrisc from missorlune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her feet were not that light footing, which strays where a bulterfly or a colourmay altract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother brealhed toher his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her sinile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native speech. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it was having been thought by ber guardians more sat that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of bereritry into this \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fcd upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could riot feel inlerest about the frivalities of fashionahle strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protector of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announed as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were conscious of hask in the smile of royality, hastened thither. ct: Aubroy was a typhoon with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himsels, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthuen was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly eourage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would last him, when he peroeived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into focus. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he wasobliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his earriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthvcn again before him—circumstanccs starled up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—thc dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image bis mind was rosting upon. It was impossible that it could be reol — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though, he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near location. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he returned into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in the oarnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wailing for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, hc again heard that voice whisper close to him —\"Reinember your oath !\"—Ho dld no dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorched by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty as the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister.\nthe reactions were now unheeded, and it was ln vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, breaking ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not all its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to brook this oath, and disclose hif suspensions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been macked. For days, hc remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw a one, and ate only when hjs started, who, with oyes, treaming with teors, bought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and silence, he left his house, roamed from the street to the street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wondored, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the thomidnight damps. He was no longer to be organized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursucr swifter than any—srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that hc felt by his absenctbe wholo of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, iri fpite of his oath, also whom Lord Ruthven approached with lntimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, this inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at lastobliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fear-\ning that his mind was becoming olienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dajly encountered in his wanderings, and of preveriting him from exposing to the general eye those marks of who they considered the hell, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His inooherence became in the last so great, that he was confined to the bis chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, bis eyes had attclined a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remclining displayed itself upon the entry of bis sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing ber hands, with looks that surely asflicted her, he would desire her not to touch his. \"Oh, do not touchhim—if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquirod to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" arid again, he ran into a slate, whence not even if he could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, lhclt several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstances of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this inark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptiols, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but iri five minutes' history was with him. He was apparently again capable of being offecled by the influence of her lovely family; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person who disliriguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was a surprise at beholding the feature of the monster who had so long Influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, andtrampled it under the foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husbarid, he looked as if he did no uriderstand her—then seizing her harids, arid gazing on her with afrantio expressiori of covntenance, he bade ber swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seomed af if that voice again bade him remember his oath— In the meantime, the guardi and physician, who had heard the whole, and though this was but a return of his disorder, enlered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them. He implored, he begged to them to delay but start once a day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined a bad taken possesslori of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthin had called the morning after the drawing-roam, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was decomed insane, his exultatiori and pleasure could hardly beconcealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and the jnlerest in his fate, gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Histonguc had dangers on toils to recount—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, fave with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, bis existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the secret art,or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at a longth to him, he obtained an important embclssy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, whon he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the tbc servants, but in the clinic. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, af she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would be better not to class any more than the mind of Miss Avbrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of the carricles broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at least overcome their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving them in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the roam, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly impossible. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his clrm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride today, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his alternatives, who, roused by the old woman, could come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a bottle, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was changed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. ct: The marriage was salemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effectiveness of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sisters' guardians might be killed, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the r leader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubroy's sister had got the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORDBYRONS RESIDENCE, etc.\n\"The world was all before hammer who chose the best place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that naine. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be hod there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmeri; and though it looks rather out of a blue truck for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watching, and the purser bargainingfar cattle with the nation-\nSeveral clergymen and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ido (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lor d, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucco. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said Grcek ,\" and would have taken me with a hiin; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He is an odd, but a very good man. The cotlage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to hirn, and he has left an old man iri oharge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for jt ,( aboul L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, although not constantly; for he said in his felucca vcry often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman could reside. We were kindly produced by an ald man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-foot — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bod-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply docorated: plain green-slained walls, marble tables on either side, a lorge rnyrtle in the oentre, and a small fouritain beneath, which could bemade to play through the branches by rnoving a spring fixed in the side of a small branze Venus in a leaning posture; a large coucb or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English chair chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bcdchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we abserved a morble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but wedid riot think our selves jvstified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess 1ay Voltoires, Sbakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousscau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Ernpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kot 2 edilion, printed at Parma j 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were killed with margi-\nfinal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\" Therefore they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that wore I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me sor a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of tclking cclre ofit, except twity zcchlnes which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a single cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brougbthere from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally ploasing. The price in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with hlock plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now a customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considered higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of a strong clear lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings, iri smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachrymcl christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" so he was very devovt ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be called \"a birdeye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A single stream issuing from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smotb as glass, clnd an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, le rminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vi sta of lofty chesnut and pamtrees,feveral small iflands wore distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our universities were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic society: none knew his name but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of this isolated lord. He had portioned high young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these art-\nct: icles. He also bought a boat now for a fisherman who lost his own in a gale, afraid he often gave Greek servants to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccerilric arid benevalent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-fortc, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we depart from the peaceful Isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had a rnoney will be evident: he had a pbilanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were displayed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the artist, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" Wc had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recuse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandcred. He has been described as an unfeeling disposjlion, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to saoth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact also directly the reverse, the class may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotef. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depioted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and clearly appear to gulde all his actions: and his courtiring the repofe of salitude is an additional reason, sormarking him as a being ori whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Berievolence bath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with a ulion, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where I must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Street.",
    "37": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John Williain Polidorl.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is sounded if very general in the East. Among the tbe Arabianf will appear to be common: it does not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianily; clnd it has only assumed its present forin since the division of tbe Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latiri body could not eorrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding vpon. the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrcline, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fcltened—and their v eins became disterided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a critical account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commmander-in-chief and magistrales of the place, they positively and unanjmously affirmed that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, thot, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had fourid a way to rid bimself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vamp This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a varnpyre himself; for about twentyor thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a depositian was made, that four perfons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having corisulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) sresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A slack was drunk entirely through the he art and hody of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This dorie, thoy cul off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashesinto bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had preuiously died from vampyrifm, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucksin his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems a belter adapted to jllustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime commilted wbilst in existence, that the deceased ls not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in tbo \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serit, Thy corse shall fram its tornb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the slrcain of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere lhey yet expire, Shollknow the demon for their fire But one that for the crime must fail, the youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless the with a father's name — That word shall wrap by heart in the flarne! Yet thou must eridthy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the Iast glassy glance must view which freezes our lifeless blue; Then with urihallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her ycllow bair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood sball drip; Thy gnasbing toolh, and haggard lip; Then stalking to lhy sulen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Suthey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vainpyre corse of the Arabian maid OneiZa, who is represented as hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she besl loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of their life, she being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonlshing cases of vampyrifm, to which he prelends ta have been on eyewilness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives iIlustrative of its effects, has put forth some leorned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curiovs and interesting notices on this singularly borrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, arid which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyro is the name in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of them ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his significantities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fall orily attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it aros e: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whieh, sixing up on the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; also wishes to see hirn, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitcmerit, and now selt the weighl of onnui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagiring their attention. In spite of the deadly burden of his face, which neuer gairied a warmer tlnt, cither from the blvsh of modesty, 0r from the strong emotion of passlon, though its form and outljne were beautlful, many of the female huriters afler notoriety attempted to win his attontions, and gain, at least, some inorks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inks of what they might term  But though the common actress could not influenco even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was jndif ferenl to him: yet such was the apparent coutlon with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overeame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his clpparent hatred of vice, be wos as often omong those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duly merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquis he. d the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary svbolterns, he cultivaled more his imagination than this judgment. He had, hence, a small high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliries' appearances. He believed all to fympathise with uirtue, and though that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scerie, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of cl cottage merely consisted of the vesting of clothes, which were aswarm, but which were better adapted to the palnter's eye by theirirregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of people were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least the truth, their languishing orromping savourites: the daughters at the same time, by their breathing courages when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his heart. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at flnding, that, accept in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the prosence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any af that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his sludy. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratisied uanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, orossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, then the tclcit assent to their existence, implied by the auoidance of their oantact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that fattered its proposition to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Raven's affairs wore embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was able to travel. Desirous of gajning some information respecling this singular character, who, tlll riow, had only whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enclble lhe young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equal ity with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if faileri from the skies, whenever scandal They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his contributions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from their proposal to join him. Flottered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gradually occepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different coriclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could riot avold remarking, lhat it was not upon the virtuauf, reduced to indigcnce by the mlsfortunes attendclnt even upon virtue, lhat he bestowcd his alms ;—tbese were sent from the ta relleve his wants, but toallow him to wallow in his lust, or to sinkbim still deeper in bis iniquity, be was sent away with rich charity. This was, bowcver, atlributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicjous, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thero was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more imprefsed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which icb thoy passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerries with which his companion fought for the centres of all fashionoble vice; he eritered into all the spirit of the faro lable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and there he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unehangjrig face, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when\none law—this apparent abstrclectedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilstdollying with the half-dead mouse. In every lown, hc left the formerly affluent youth, turn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solilude of a dvngeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst rnany a father sat frantic, amidst the spoaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, which to huy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, then last gilder he had just snatched from the convule grasp of the innocerit: this might hurt be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wishes to reprefent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profile ;— but he deloyed it—for each day he hopod his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and only to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in hiscarriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid though Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, be oblained no greater gratification from it than the conftant excitement of voinly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imaginationbegan to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rame, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the marning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost desertod city. Whilst he was also engaged, letters arrived from England, which he operied with eagor impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; is it had before entering into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, the seomed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his liccntious habits more dangerous to society. Il bad been discovered, that his cantempt for the adul tress bad not originated in hatred of hor character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his vlctim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urisullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, thclt al thoso females whorn be hod sought, apparently on\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, posing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by urinoticed. He enlered into the same circle, and soan received that his Lordship was endoavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he cheerfully frequented. In Itoly, it is seldom that an unmarried female is mct with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Aubrey's oye followed bim iri all his windings, and soon disoouered that an assigriation hod becn appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, th ovgh thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his iritentioris with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his interactions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being prefsed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decide accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ardered his servant to seek another apartment, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of also he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Peninfula, soon found himself of Athens. He then fixed his rcsidence in the house of a Greek; and soori occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, asbamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had bidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, orie would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchariged her eyes, apparently the eye of an ariimaled natvre, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animal svited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accampanied Aubrey in hissearch after antiquities, and often would the unconsoious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it wcre upori the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered uponan almost an effacod tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tressos falling, as she flitted arourid, exhiblt in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swistly fading hues, it might well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who lel escape from his ring the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why a couple to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffecled by crowded drawing-rooms arid stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his suture hours, sbe would st and by, and watch the magic effects of his pcncil, iri tracing the scenes of her nalive place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plclin, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of yautbful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing her infancy; and lhen, Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exeited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had pa ssed years amidst his friends, and dearost ties, forcedevery year, byfeeding upon the life of a lovely fernale to prolong his existence sor the cnsuing moriths, his hlod would run cold,whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horri She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monfters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a protty aecvrate descriptian of LordRuthven; he, however, still persisted on persuadling her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrafted with all the affected virtues of those women among whom had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marry-\ning an uneducated Greek girl, he still found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hjm. Hc would tear himself at timos from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquari research, he would depclrt, determined not to return until bis object was ottained; but he always found it impossible to six his ottention upon lhe rvins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that somemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uncoriscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite habits, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelchingor, unovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She badly appealed to her parents on the front of Vampyres, and they both, with a several present, affirmed their existence, palo with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his oxcursions, which was to detajn him for a few hours; when they heard the name of tbe placo, tbey all at once hegged him not to retvrri at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greok would euer remain, after the day had clo sed, upon clny consl deration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their national origins, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their represeritations, and lried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he sclw them fhudder at this daring thus to mock a fuperior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattonded; he was surprised to observe the melanoholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;—ho promised. He was, however, so occupied in this research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there wasane of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon lhe devoled country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delcly: bul it was too late. Twilight, ln these southorn elimatef, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—ils echoing thunders had fcarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its wind through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide her to the town, or at least trusting to oblain sholter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached ched, tbe thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with lhe stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbrokeri sourid ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thundor which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the but. He borrowed himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no police was taken of him. He sounded himself in contact with someone who he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\" Again basfled !\" to whieb a loud laugh succeeded; and he selt himself grappled by one whose strength is grappled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw bimself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placod his hands upon hif throat — when the glare of many torches penetrating through the bole that gave Iight in the day, disturbed hlm ;—he inslantly rose, and, leclv-\ning this prey, rushed through the do or, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer hea rd. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the inside wall, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. Al the desire of Aubrey lhey searched for her who had attracted him by her crees; he wclf agairi left in darkness; but what was his horror, where the light of the torches once more burst upori him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduclress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but be again saw some form, when he unclosed them, strelched by the side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her Iip; yel there was stillnefs about her focus that seemed almost as attaching to her life that once dwelt thre :—vpon her neck and broast was blood, arid upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to thjs the men poiriled, crying, simultaneously strvck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A l itter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was l l lied by the fide of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within a chair. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed arid seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—ho held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in a lho hut. They were soori met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of the beer whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the lho city, formerly the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. —T0 describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the causo of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corsc. They were inconsolable; both died, break-hearted.\nAubrey being put tobed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals would call upon Lard Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some uriaecounlable combination seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would impreact maledictions upon his bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this train to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant constant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was hurried and startlod at the sight of hjm whose image had now compared with that af a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, irnplying almost repentance for the faull that had caused their separation, and still more by the attentiori, clnxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordsbip soemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalcscence began to be rapid, he again gradually retlred into lhe sarne started of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at tj mes he was surprised to meet his gclze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbf, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish toavoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastieity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silenee as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for soljtude, his mind could not find il in the neighbourhood of Athens; jf he soughl it ami dst lhe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthes form ood by his side—jf be sought lt in the woods, her light step would appoar wanderingamidst the uriderw ood He determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every division, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed only to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the gencrosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they traveled with only a few cards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narraw defile, at the bottom of which was the hed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neigbbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the wholo of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whisting of bullets close to their heads, and by the ecboed report of several guns. In an iristarit, their guards had loft them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had been to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the short turn of the defile: but asharned of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouls bade them advance, and being exposed to unrcsisting slaughter, if the clny of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, theydetermined at one to rush forward in search of the onemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistanco; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of the royal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—thcy being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised surn, for which he held an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been objjts about him: hut towards the close after last evening, his mind became apparently uneosy, and his eyes often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may solve me — you may do more than that — I mean not only life, I heed the death of my experience as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrcy .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the wholo — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my bonour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I —I —but life. \"—\" It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himsels with exultant violence ,\"Swear hyall your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon a high pillow, arid breathod no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; then many circumstances attending his acquaintance with a thif man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rifing early in the morning, he was about to enter the houel in whichho had left the corpse. When a robber met him, orid informed him that it was no longer tbere, having been conveyed by himsels and eomradcs, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of themoon that rose after his death. Aubrey astoriished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spat where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though therobbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was hewildered in the conjeoture, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible missortunes, and iri which could apparently conspired to hoighton that superstitious melancholy that bad seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects to be had with him, referring to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons or offences, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggersand attacks. Whether turning them out, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a shealh apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hasteriing to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though pecul-\na diary shaped, lhe sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to dissolve; but the particular form, the same varying points upon the haft and sheolh were alike in splendour on both, and lest no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens' executive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of her since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and sllent; and his only occupation oonsisted in urging the speed of the postings, as he was going to save the life of someone held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafled bim to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her irifantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room ossemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind heneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul consciousness of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may be altract — it was sedate and pensive. Wheri alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when ber brothcr brea thod to her his affeclion, and would in her presenceforget those griefs she knew destroyed his r est, who would have changed her smile for that of the voluntary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— that face were then playing in the light of their own native shape. She was yet only eighleen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the coach of her entry into the \"bvsy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his sathers, and fed up with melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for them the next day, which the child began as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-roorn had riot been held for a long time, arid all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly sounded by the arm, and a voice he recogriized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He could hardly have the courage to turn, feel careful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, if he were afraid his thoughts were hurting from his hrain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He roused himself, who could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thaught his imagination had conjured up the lmago his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for thought he was altempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the family of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matrori, who retired into a process, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forwar d, seized his sister arrn, and, with hvrried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erigaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did nol dance to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was erigrossed, now that the certainty of the monster living agoin pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrible.\nct: friend her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, boaring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avertits progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his questions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wrelch; but death, he remembered, child beeri had already mocked. For days, he remains in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with oyes, streoming with tears, besought a bim, for her sake, to support nature. Al last, no longer capable of bearing stiffness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His defs became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day suri as to the midright damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first hc returned with the evening to the house; hut at left hc laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow bim; but they were soon dislanced by bim wbo flcd from a proper swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whoso presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into socioty, and watch him loosely, anxious to forewarri, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with inli-\nct: Macy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so ftriking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected her so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardjans thought proper to improve, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDefirous of saving bim from the injuries and sufforings, he had daily encounters in his wonderlings, and of preventing him from expasing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely wcls his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incaherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He could become emacioted, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and rccollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, witb looks that surely offlicted her, he would desire her not to touob him. \"Oh, do riot touch him — if your love for me isaught, do riot go near him !\" Where, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he sank into a slate, whence not even she could forgive him. This lost many moriths: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his incherences became less frequent, and his incherences threw off the cl portiori of its gloom, but his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upori his fingerf a definile number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going to the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of retvrning insect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Mclrsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be pre-sent to the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her check, wet with tears, flowing the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of afsection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distunguished far rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perccivod a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at bebolding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He sent the portrait in a paroxysm of rago, and trampled it vndcr foot. Upon her asking hlm why he thus destroyed theresemblance of her father husband, he looked as if he did not understarid her—then seizing her horids, arid gazing ori her with a frantic expression of couritenan ce, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance —it Iri, the meantime, the guardians and pbysician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but called the return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, didsired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be implored, he begged off them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, and enacted to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvenhad called the morning after the drawing-room, andhad became confused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could barely be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former composition, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affectlan for the mother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue bad dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself cls of an individual having no sympathy with any heing on the erowded earth, savc with her to whom he oddressed himself ;— could tell the bow, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely thal he might listen to her soothing accents ;— in flne, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening that marriage ,( in spite of her brother's changed state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physicion and his guardiaris, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few bours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to haross any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night possed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a boreror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, arid the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cur -.\nthe iosity of servants at last ovorcamo their vigilance, they gradually stolo away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the compartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the stalrcase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oa tb, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are careful !\" So saying, who pushed him tawards bis clttendarits, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support him; his rage not finding a count, had broken blood-vessel, and he was convcyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he enlered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solomnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAubrey weokness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardjans might be called, and when the midnight hovr had struck, he relatod completely what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hostened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthveri had disappeared, and the Aubroye sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CD NTAINING AN ACCOUNTY LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\" The world was also before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\n e .\"\nIN sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put irito the harbour of Milylene, in the land of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there,induee many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound toSmyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the mcn were employed in watering, arid the purscr bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and rnyfelf took a rainble to the cove called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticulture narned) we met with a clnd engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our cultural in his club. \"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have lakeri me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the lhc river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, a wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currenc-\n) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in this festival very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time, iri hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old Indian, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four oparlments ori l the ground-sloor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting porlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus iri, a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa completed thefurniture. Iri the half stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-class: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The hedchamher had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with a stuffed cotton quilt and a pillow — the cornmon bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-roam we observed a marble recess. formerly, the old man told us, filled with bookf and paper ers, which were then in a large seamcln chest in the elosl: it was open, but we did not think of ourselves justified in examining the contents. on the tablet of the recesf lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau works complete; Volricy Rujns of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mjlton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editian, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press of Constantinople, much torn, Most of these books were filled with marginal texts, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so peculiar, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Arrnenian who refides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom they brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for the whole reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extremely pleasing. The portico in front was fully paces long and sourteon broad, and the fluted marble pilars with black plinths and fret-work cornicef ,( as it is now customary iri Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpet, beneath the awning of strong coarsc linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon the Greeks pass their overiings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryrna Christian\", eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left bandas we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clovering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lordpassed many of bis evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" sclid the oldman ,\"praying\" far he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides the Sun class .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A single stroam issuing from the rules descended iri brokon cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mourilains baso. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the vlew in front; and a little on the lest, through a vista of left cbesnut on palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emercled green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our cnquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic soltude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Caridia. \"The Armenian,\" said our doctor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not had time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the island lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and influential character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was osten seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inforination with which we doparted from the peaceful Isle of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the rack, guessling who this rambler in Greece could be. He held money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of depression, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our colleagues were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom yauare so anxious, is Lard Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his l ordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more nervous in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylone on some future day; but to me that day would never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as a clri unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his home. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the purpose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence bath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are evor to be received with caution, particularly when dlrected against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alono may ensure the error of a fellow-morla. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtue, art and self-approving coriscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Pririter, Crown-court, Street.",
    "38": " THEVAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arablans it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churehes; at which time, the idea became prevalent, that a Latin body could not be corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and farmed the subject of many wonderful stories, still oxtarit, os lhe dead rising from their graves, and fcoding upon the blood of the ya In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that uampyres tightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became einaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died os consumptions; whilst tbese hurnan blood-suckers fattened—and their veins hooame distended to such a stato of repletion, as to cause lhc blood flow from all the passage\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a serious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of compyrism, which is started to have occurred at Madreygcl, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-jn-chief and mclgistrates of the place, thoy positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pau l, had heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a wcly to rid him inself of the evil, by ealing some of the earth This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been lormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his ottacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, arid found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresb, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the movth, nose, and eclrs, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, ot which he is reported to have cried out as deeply as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the clothes into his grave. The same measures were divided with the forces of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lesl they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief, if that a person sucked by a varnpyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks iri this turn.\nct: Chlef bailiff.\nThis inonstrous rodomoritade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime ommittedwhilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyriso, but compelled to corifine his infernal visitations easily to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt tho native place, And suok the blood of all thy roce; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At rnidnjgt drain tho stream of lise; Yet locltbe the banquet which perforce Muft feed thy Iivid living oorse, Thy victiins, cre they yet But one that sor thy crime must fall. The youngest, besl heloved af all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the heart ln flame! Yet thou must end the task arid mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Whioh freezes over its lifeless blue; Theri with unhallowed handshall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock when shorn Affections foridesl pledge was worn— Butnow is borne away by the Memorial of thinc agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sulleri grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild best beautiful poem of \"ThaIaba,\" the vampire corse of the Arabian maid Alliance, who is represented after having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst iri existerico. But this cannot be supposed to have resulled from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed through the shape of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Toumefort gives a long account in his travel of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and lraditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarjan error.\nMany cvrious and intore sting notlces ori this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devotcd to explancltion, and which may now be conoluded by merely remclrking, thal though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several otherssynoriymous with it, rnade use of in various ports of the world: as Vroucalocha\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the middle of this dissipations ottendant upon a London win-\nthere, there appeared at the various parties of the leadors of the toria nobleman, more remarkable for his signatures, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth ground hlm, as he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracled his attentian, that he might by cl look level it, and throw sear into those breasts where thoughtlessly reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could riot explain whence it aroso: somc altributed it to the dead grey eye, which, sixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaderi ray that weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities covered him to be invited to every house; all wished to seo him, and those who bad beer accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their altention. Iri spite of the deadly hue of his face, which neuer gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong cmotion ofpassiori, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female fighters after notoriety attempted to win his attention-\nians, and gairi, at least, the same marks of what they might term asfeclion: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did clll but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice :— though in vain :— when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her,still it seemed as is they were unperceived ;— even her un But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, just was not that the female sexwas indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent conclusion with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to femalef. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcome the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hotred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon, a young geritleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an ordinary sister in the possession of great wealth, by priests who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subaltcrns, he cullivated more his imagination lhari his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. Hc believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely eonsisted on the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the paintereyo by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, arid rich: sar these reasons-\nns, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrourided him, striuing which should describe with least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at that time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon Ied him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his society hourf, he started at finding that, except in the lallow and wax candles that fllckered, not from the presence of a ghost, bvt srom want of snuffing, there was no foundation in reallife for any of those congeries of pleasing piclures and descriptions contained in those volumcs, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, was able to reinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched bim; and tho very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man enlirely abforbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observalion of extemal objects, than the tcleit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of lbeir contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered jts propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hcro of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. Hc gradually learnt that Lord Rutbvens osfairs were embarrassed, and soori found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to trovel. Desirous of gajning some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whettcd his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which sor many generations had been thought necessary to enable the young to take some ropid steps in the career of voice towards putting tbemselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as lf fallon from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of plo They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of the system from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHithertomubrey had a bad rio opportunity to study Lord Ruthvcns character, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to hif conduct. His companion was profusc in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagaband, and the beggar, received from his hand more than aiming to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuovs, reduced to indigenc by the misfortunos attendant even upon virtue, that he understood his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to walk in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This waf, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the viciouf, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtvous indigenl. There was one circumstarice about the eharity of this Lordship, which was still more impressive upon his mind: all those upon whom it was hestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon il, because they were also either led to lhc scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most awful misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all sashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and thon he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthf In every town, helefl the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this flend; whilst many father fat frantic, amidst being speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late imrnenso wealth, whorewith to buy oven susficiently to satisfy their present craving. Yethe took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocen t: this might but be the result of a certain deg ree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combining the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign thatcharity and pleasure which proved the ruin of the call, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he dclayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak srankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his circle, and clmidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Avbrey was near the objeet of his curiosity, he obtained no groater grotification from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break thal mystery, which to his exalted imagination begari to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorlals of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letlers arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from hif guardians, the latter astoriished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him a sufficierit reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his sriend, and vrged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seductian, fried his liccntious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered ed, that bis eontempt for the adultress had not orlgiriated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratisication, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle ofunsulified virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside,\nAubrey deterinined upon the leaf-\nhaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abaridoning him oltogelher, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him inore closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. Ho entered irito the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inoxperience of the daughler of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, just if seldom that on unmarried female is met with ln society; he was therofore obliged to carry on his planf in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been oppointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthuen answered that his interactions were such or he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remalnder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to some other apartmerits, and calling upon the mother of this lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also cancerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation will be preserved. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hurt any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHave I left Rome, Aubrey directed his step towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon inonumerits that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves because of sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existing being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a palnter which wants to pourtray on canvass to promise hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the inountain side, one would have thought to gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that slecpy Iuxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompclnied Avbrey in hif search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of o Ka shmero Butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floclting as it was upon the wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almofl effaced labIet, ln the contemplation of her sylph-like Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such dolicately brilliant and swistly fading bues, it might well excvse the forgetfulness of the anllquary, who let escape from his mind the very object which had before thought of vilal importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But by attempt to describe chorms which oll fcel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffectod by crowded drawing-rooms arid stifling ballf. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing these scenes of her notive place; she would then describe him the crying dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colors of yourhful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing inher infancy; and then, tvrning to subjects that had euidently made a greater impression upon her nurse. Her earneslncss and appclrent belief of what she nclrated, excited the interest even of Avbrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wbo had passed years amidst his friends, arid dearest ties,forced every year, by feeding upon the lise of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, hjs 6 lood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though al the same time he wondered at the manycoincidencef which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rulhven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, when his heart; and whilo be ridiculed the idea of a young man of English babils, marrying an unedvcated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy before him. He would tear himfelf at times from her, arid, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclroh, he would depart, determined not to return until bis object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention to the rvjns around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone lhe rightful possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, the arid was ever the same frank innatile being he had first known. She always seemed to parfram him with reluctanco; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hond of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they thought, with a several present, affiliated their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at right, or he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would evor remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, arid denovnced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, clnd tried to laugb them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus ta mock a superior, inferrial power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey sel off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncholy sace of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible flends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly beggod of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horeon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upori the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horsc, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it would be too late. Twilight, in these southern climatos, almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night bcgins: and there he had advanced far, the power cram of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—itf thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at bis very feel. Suddenly, his horso took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The criminal at last, through fatigue, stopped, arid he found, by the glare of lightning, lhat he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted himself up from the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood which around it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment sjlent, allowed him to hear the dreadful fhries of a wincln mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: bvt, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, farced openthe door of the hvt. He found himself in utter darkness: sound d, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; sorry, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice eried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt hiinself grappled by one whose strength secmed superhuman: determined to sell his life af dearly cls he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his seat and hurled with enormous foroe against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his The storm was a riow still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded ori every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; hc was again Ieft in darkness; but what waf his horror, when the light of the torches one more bursl upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he was unclosed them, strehed by his side. There was a rio colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching to the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veln :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously slruck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laidby the side of her who had been bad lately because of biming the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously on his hand or naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by differentparties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached the city, forewamed the parents of some dreadful catastrophe .— To describe their griof would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsotable; both died brokenhearted.\nAubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a mosl violent fever, and was often delicious; in those intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iantbe—by some una ccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecote moledictlons upon his bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever molive, upori hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constarit attendant. When the latter recovered from his deliriurn, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he held now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no loriger appeared that apathelio being wbo had so astonisbed Aubrey; bul af soan as bis convalescence began to be rapid, be again gradually returned into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former mon, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a srnile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunte During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those obf, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so dislinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her lightslep would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale sace and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter solutions in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of help during his illness, though they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in evory direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus hasteriod from the place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excile the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of this neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow process, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the ecboed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, found, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to first in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the she-\nltering turn of the dofile: but ashamed of being tbus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, is only of the robbers should cl imb above and take them in the rear, they determined at ance to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, where Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the canlest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' face around him — his guards having, upon Lord Rutbvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy the promise of groat reward, Aubrey soon introduced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring eabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they boing conterit merely to guard the eritronce till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the mortlfication ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasy steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious of pain loss. he had been of theobjects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his affection with more than usual earnestness —\"Afsift me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I need the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honor, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but little —my lise ebbs apace — I cannot explode tbe whole — but if you conceal all you kriow ofmc, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth —arid if my death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultarit violence ,\"Swo ar by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, fwear that, for a year and a day you will not import your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being iri only way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing on a bis pillow, arid breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances altending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered this oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awcliting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighhouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury just upon the spot where it lay. Bvt, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. Far a lime his mind was bcwildered in conjectures, but he at least returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancboly that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a uessel to convey him to Otranto, or also the places, he occupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with them belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a cold case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning lhem outer, and examining their curious forms, which was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamonted in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastenling to gain further proof, he found the woman, and his horror may be imagined when being discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his h and. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelievo; but the porticular farm, the samevarying tints upon the haft and shath were like in splendour on both, and left rio room for doubt; there were also draps of hlood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatoh from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been a beard of since the doparture of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repcated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became rnorose and silent; and his only occupation oonsisted in urging the speed of the postilions, if he were going to save the life of some order to bold dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted home to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lase, in the embraces and coresses of his sister's small memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, hod gained bisfection, the riow that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not thought of winning the grape which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was a relief of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter room. Hor step was not that lightfooting, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the srnile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed bis rest, who would have excharigod her smile for the photo of the vocabulary? It seems dead as if those eyes —-\nthat face was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eightcen, and had not been presented to the world, while having been thought by her guardions more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the marisiori of his sathors, and fed upon the melancholy who overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionablo strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which could be announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastencd either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a comer by himself, hcedless of all around hiin, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his car —\"Remember your oath .\" He bad hardly had courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blaslhim, when he perceived a little distance, the same figure which had attracled his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear lheir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a s friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his clriago, and was drlven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were hurt from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him —circumstances started up in a dreadful array — the dagger —his oath .— He rovsed bimself, could not believe it possible — to be dead rife again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the imago his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to talk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining informotion. He went a few times after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leoving her under the production of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Percelving, not last, that many were leaving, he roused bimself, andentering another room, found his sislersvrrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he contacted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sisler's arm, clnd, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracled. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the morties living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, arid those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slartled him ;—wcls he then lo allow this rnonster to roam, beariring ruiri upon his breath, amldstail he held deor, and not avert its progress? Every sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he lest bis house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted the bim. His dress became neglecled, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He wasn't longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid a bim down to a circle wherever fatigue overlooks him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow bjm; but they were soon distariced by him who fled from a pressure swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence to the whole of his friends, with a friend omongst them, of whose presence they wore unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of the hif oath, all whom Lord Rever approached with intimaey. But when he entered a roam, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings were so visible, that his fister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstronoe proved unagaining, the guordians thought proper to intorpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming a1 enated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon thcm by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of sauing him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engoged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one torrible subject. His incoherone became at least so great, that he was convinced to his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaoiated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection arid recollection remairiing displayed it self upon the even try of his sister; then would sometimes start, arid, seizing her hands, which looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reforred, his only answer was ,\"True! Truo !\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse a bim. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was possing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portian of its gloom, whilst his guardlans observod, that several times in the day he would count upon hjsfingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThis time had nearly elapsed, when, upori the last day of the yeor, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physlcian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreyf being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going the next day to be rnarried. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been depressed, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thiriking this was a young Earl whom he had mel with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by bis exchanging hls entenlion to be present at the nationals, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplisbrent; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breasl; opening it, what was his surprise at behind the features of the monster who had so long infuenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under a fool. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the relationship of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then soizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morisler, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if thal police again bade him reinember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinkjngLord Ruthvon was near him but saw no one In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had beard the whole, arid thought this would build a return of his disorder, cntered, and sorcing him from Miss Avbrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon the blue knees together, he implored, he begged them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this tothe infanity, they imagined a child taking possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he really understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation arid pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastcned to the house of his former companiori, arid, by constant acceptance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and intcrest in his fate, he gradually won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on crowded carth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—could lell how, since he knew her, his existence, had been a seem worthy of preservation. If it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brclrich falling at length to him, he ohtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for addressing marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his deporture for the content.\nAubrey, where he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given bim; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms called their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better riots to harass any more the kind of MissAubrey by, what he considered, the rovings of a moniao. Night passed on without rest to the busy inhabitants of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be concoived than described, the noles of baby preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcome their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the study of an helpless old woman. He selzed the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assernable. Lord. Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Wheri on the staircose, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendees, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Avbrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a bloodfel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion ofblood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the roader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardiaris hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lard Revlhven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\nct :\"The world was all before him, where to choose the best place of rent, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sa iling through the Grecjan Arohlpelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrria, its bountjes nearly repay for the deuialion of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the hay, and whilst the runner were employed in watching, and the purser bargcl-\nining for cattle with the relatives, the clergymari and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, arid other places, whoro we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the field four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. ct :\"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, bolongs to hlm, arid he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteeri months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had a reason. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet unnexed. They wcrc all simply docorated: plain green-staind walls, marble tohes on either side, a large myrtle in the centro, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bron ze Venus in a leaning poslure; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the cornmon bed through Greeee. In the sitting room we observed a marble reccss. formerly, the old mari told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a l arge seaman chest in the closet: il was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in explaining the contents. On the tab, let of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Bolleaus, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Rulns of Empires; Zimmcrman, in the Germari language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schillers play of the Robbers; Milton's Parodise Lost, an Italiari edition, printed at Parma in 1880; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much to Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sajled, and forgot to p lace them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must Iie until his returri; for he is so partiovlar, that were I lo move one thing without order, he would frown upon me for a week together; he just always was very good. I once did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm sor the lroublo of taking care of it, except the zechines which I paid to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what resori .\"\nct: The appearance of the house was actually pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long on fourteen broad, and the flvted marble pilars with black plinths and frel-work cornicef ,( as it is now a customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was cavered by a fire Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong caarse linen. Most of the hovse-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian, eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid as we registered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orangos and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamonal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and rights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, beside Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be terrand \"o birdeye view .\" A line of rich vlneyards led the eyc to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple clappered iri majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken areas, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unfhadowed by a single cloud, terminatos the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, severol small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; our enquirles were fruitless as to the name of the person who had refided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cann't you lell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I con\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the American, but on our return to the townwc learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight younggirls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new boot for a fisbermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek treatment to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been very eccentric and be a nevolent ohoracter. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deparled from the peaceful Isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing about this ramblor in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a pbilanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which inark peculiar geriius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mjtylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calclo on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that dcly will never return. I make this sentence, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been gradually slandered. He has been described as an unfoeling disposition, averfe to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to such ils sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, some to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude also an additional reason for mclrking him or a being on whose beart Religlon hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolerice hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to bc received with caution, particularly when direcled against man moral integrity; and he who doesres justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest lestimony of a precious heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-colour, Fleet-street.",
    "39": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabiaris it appears to be common: it does not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Lcltin and Greek cburches; at which time, the idea became prevalent, that a Lalin body could not corrupl if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories.\nies, full extant, af the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. Iri the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and fpeedily dled of con-\nsumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their voices became distended to such a state 0s repletion, as to couse the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and evon from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, if a curjous, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is a statistic that occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upori an examination of the commander-in-chief and magislrcltes of the plaee, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, at Cclssovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormerited by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of evil, by eating some of the earth out of the uampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire hiinself; for about twenty or thirty days after bis death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by bimland a deposition waf made, thatfaur people had been deprived of life by hif attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inbabitants having consulted their Hadogni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisin) fresh, and enlirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accusation remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, but which he is reported to have cried out class dreadsully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the scratches into his grave. The same meosvros were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThis universal belief is that a perfon sueked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his lurn.\nct: Chief bailisf.\nThis monstrous rodomonta de is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous erime committed while in existence, that the deccafed is not only doomed to vampyrise, but cornpelled to conflne his infernal uisitations solely to those beings he loved inost while upon earth—thoseto whom he wof bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alludedto in the \"Gjaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serit, Thy corse shall from its tomb 6 e rent; Then ghafty haunt the native place, And svck the blood of all thy race; Tbero from thy daughter, slster, wifo, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall knowthe demon for their sire But one that for the lhy crime must fall, the yovngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name — That word shall wrap the lhy beort in flamo! Yet thou must on the task and mark Her cheek last tinge—her eycs last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then witb unhallowed hcland shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borneaway by the Memorial of thirtie agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashiring looth, and haggard lip; Thon stalking to the sullen grave, Go—ond with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returried from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she bestloved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resultod from the sinfulness of beer life, the being pourtrayed through the whole of the tale of a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracius Tournefort gives a long account in bis travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calinet, in hif great work upon this subject, besides a variety of clnecdotos, and tradilionary narratives illustralive of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbariari error.\nMany curious and interesting nolicef on this singularly horrible superstitian might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, neoessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though term compare is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with lt, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulacba,Goul, BroucoCl, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at various parties, often leaders of the ton a nobleinan, more remarkable for his sirigularities, than his ronk. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only clttracted his attention, that he might by a lack quell it, and thraw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness rcigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to perietrate, clnd at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden roy that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to overy bouse; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention n. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotiori of passion, threw hersolf in his way, and did all but put on the drcss of a mountaincbank, to attract his riotice :— though in vain :— when she stood above him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her, still it seemed as if they were impoceived ;— even her unappalled impu But though the common adultress could no influence evon the guidance of his eyes, it was riot that the female sex was indisferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and inriocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to seinales. He had, however, the reputation of a winriing tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those femoles who forrn to boast of their sex from their domestic virtves, as ainong those who usually it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was arphan left with an ordinary sister in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while both were in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mereenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He holds, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all tosympathise with a virus.\nue, and thought that vice was lhrown in by Providence merely for the pictures of the scene, aswo see inromances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisled in the vefting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painte-\nkeep an eye by their irregular folds and variouscoloured patches. Hc thought, in fine, that the dreams of pets were the realities of life. He wos h andsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the doughters at the sarne time, by their brlghtening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of bif talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started to find that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from wantof snuffing, there was no soundation in real life for only those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed bis sludy. Finding, however, some compensation in his gralified vanity, he was about to relinquish their dreams, where the extraordinary being we have above described, crofsed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other figns of his observation of exlernal objects, then the tacjt assent to their exislence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its property toextravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hcro of a romance, and determined to observe the osfspring of his fancy, rather thantho person He became acquainted with bim, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually found that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were ombarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only wbetted his curiosity, hehinted to his guardians, that it was lime for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if follen from these skios, wheriever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degre They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a inark of the fact from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was a process in his liberality ;— the id love, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reducod to indigenc by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wclnts, bvt to allow hiin to wallow in his lust, or to sirik him still deeper in his ini This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the various iridigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whoin it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a cure upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most object misery. At Brussels and other towns lhrough which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparerit eagerness with whicb his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he betted, and always gambled with fuccess, except where the known shclrper was hjs antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always wilh the same unchanging faoe, wilh which he generally watched the rash youthful novice, or the luck In euery towri, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the oircle hc adorned, cursing, in tho side of a dungcon, the fate that badly drawn him within the reach of this friend; which many a father sat frantic, amidfl thc speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single sarthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gombling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, then gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, Japanese 0s comboting the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrcy often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his owri profit ;— but be delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this river occurred. Lard Ruthveri in his carriage, and amidst tbe various wild and rieh scenes af nature, was always the same: hiseye spokeless than his lip; arid thovgh Aubrey wos near the objoct of his curiosity, heobtained no groater gr atification from it than the canstant excitement of vainly wishing to break that inystery, which to his exa lted imagination began to assume the appearance of something fupernotural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time losing sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the blue morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager irnpatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished bim; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, there seemed to give bim sufficient reason for the beli-\nef .. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of society, rendered his licenlious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that hif contempt for lhe adults had not originated in hotred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gralification, lhat his victim, the partner of his gvilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vnsullied virtue, down to the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his doparture, thrown even l\nEvery determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shawn a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some possible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whoso house, he chiefly frequented. Iri Italy, it if seldom that an vnmarried female ls inetwich in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in fecret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innacent, though tboughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Rutbvenanswered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, meroly laugh ed. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to check other apartments, and oalling upon the mother of the lady, jnformed her 0s all he knew, not only with regard to herdaughter, but also concorning the character of his Lordship. The signation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next doy merely sent his seruant to notify his complete asserit to a separatiori; bul did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrcys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey dlrected bls sleps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soan occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient gloryupon monuments that apparently, ash-\nthe name of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before leaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many colovred liohen. Undor the same raof as himself, existed abeing, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to protect the faithful in Mclhomets paradife, save that her eyes spoke loo much mind sorany one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plclin, or tripped along the mountain side, one would hove through the ga2elle a poor type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and osten would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of cl Kashm ere buttorfly, shaw the whole beauty of her form, sloating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablel, in the contomplation of her sylph-like place. Ofteri would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, oxhibit in the ray such a delicate brilliclent and swiflly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgct-\nfliess of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pavsanias. But why attempt to describe the charm which all feels, but noc can appreciate ?— It was innocenee, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooins and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his suture hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, intra cing the scenes of her native place; she would then describo to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colour of yuthsul mernory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; clnd then, turning to su objects that had evidently made a greater Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by fecding upon the lfe of a lovely female to prolorig his existence for the ensuing months, his bload would run cold, whilst he altempted to laugh her oul of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iaritho She detailed to bim the traditional appearance of three monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on porsuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondored clt many coincidences which had all tended to excite cl belief in the supernaturol power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; ber innocence, so contrasted with all the affectod virtues of women among whom he had sought for his version of romance, wan his heart; and while he ridiculcd the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Groek girl, still he found himself more and rnore alta-\ncheck to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquclrian research, he would dopart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fill his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in ske tching or uncovoring some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had applied to my parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very narne. Soon after, Aubrey determined to prepare one of his excursions, which was to describe him for a few hours; when they heard the narne of the place, they all at once beggcd of hjm not to return al night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any confideration. They described it as theresort of the vampires in their noctumal origins, and denounoed the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNextmorning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unatlended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a lerror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged him to return, there night allowed the power of those beings to be pulled in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did riot peroeive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizori there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climatos, so rapidly gather into a trernendaus inass, and pour all the lheir rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horfe, determined to make up by speed for his delay: hut it was too late. Twilight, in these southerri climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: arid where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely aninterval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying folioge, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he fourid, by the glare of lightning, that ho was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to abtain shelter from the peltirig of the storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for a inamont silerit, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrjeksos cl woman mirigling with tbb stifled, exultant mookery of cl laugh, conlinued in one almost unhroken sound ;—ho was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though being called, ftlll the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. Hefound himself in contact with some orie, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Agairi baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himsels grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and kneeling upan his breast, had placed bis hands upon his throat—wheri the glare of many torches penetrating through The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; was agoin left in darkness; but what was his harror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corso. He hurt his eyes, hoping that it will but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was a colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attoching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon ber neck and breclst was hlood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men poinled, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him, the object of so many bright and sairy visions, now followed with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, clrid take refuge in uacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catostrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they afcertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconso-\nthe label; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed will sejzed with a most violent feuer, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthveri and upon Ianthe—by some unaccounlable combination he seemed to beg of hif former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate malodictions upon his head, and curse him cls a bear destroyer. Lord Ruthveri, chanced at this time to arrive at the ns, and, from whatever motive, upon bearing of the structure of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered srorn his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whosc image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but LordRuthven, by his kirid words, implying almost repentance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and still rnore by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetio being wba had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rclpid, he agaln grodually retired into the same state of mind, arid Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gazc fixed iritcntly upan hlm, with cl smile of malicious oxultation playing upan During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in the morning the progress of those orbs, circling, like over the world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence of Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor soul-\ndc, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins who had formerly sroquerited, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he fought it in the woads, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would sbow, to his wild iinagination, her face face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon He determined to fly scenes, the overy feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himsels bound by the tender care he had taken of hirn during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet feon. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot which recollection would be attached: but though they thvs bastened from place to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of the rohbers, both gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting theadvice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guids than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilc, at the bottom of which was then hed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the reighbouring precipiccs, they hod the reason to repent their negligerice; for scarcelywere the whole of the party engaged in the riarrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets clofe to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an ancient, their guards had left them, and, placing lhomsolves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubroy, imitating their example, retired for an inoment behind the sbellering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by o foe, who with insulting shouts made them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slclughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in fear of the enomy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assislance; and, no longer hceding the contest on his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arrns and surreridered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon introduced them to convey his wounded sriend to a neighboring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, be was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their compromise should return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Rulhvens strength rapidly decreased; long two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconsciously of pain clf he had been of the obieots about him: but towards the elofe of the last evening, hls mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Auhrey, who was introduced to for his assistance with more than usual eamestness —\"Asfist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may have my honor, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .,\"I tried but a little —my life ebbs apaee — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and is my death where unknown for some time in England —I — I — bvt life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in a clny way, whatovor inoy has happened, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes soemed bursling from their socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from this presonliment or something horrible awalting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel jn which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer thore, having been oonveyed by himself arid cornrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaclc of a ncighboring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first old ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aurey astonishod, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where lt lay. But, when he had mounted to the summlt, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clolhes, though the robbers swore they poinled out theidentical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country iri which he had met with such terrible misfartunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighton that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a uessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupiod himself in arranging those effeels he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. Whilsl turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at sinding a shack apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discavered in the fatal hut—he fhuddered—hastening to gain surther proos, he sound the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, lhough peculiarly shaped, tho sheath he held in hishand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the partieular form, the same varying tints upon tho hast and sheath were allke in sploridour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had atl empted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arls. Hor parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had seen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and the only occupation could besisted in urging the speed of the poftilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Eriglish shores; and he hclstened to the inans ion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ernbraces and classes of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her insantine actress, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room ossemblies. There was none of that like brjlliclney which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not thatlight footing, which strays where a butlorfly or a colour mcly attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, what would have changed her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that fate were then ploying in the light of their owri native sphere. She was yet only eight ei ghteen, and had riot been preserited to the world. Will having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoeh of her entry into the \"busy feene\". Auhrey would rathor have remained in the mansion of hisfathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolitics of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so strange by the events he had witnessed; he would be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive.\nive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened the thitber. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. Which? be was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wasin that very place — he felt himself suddenly selected by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, saunded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blame him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notico on this spot upon bis first entry into society. He gazod till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven horns. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid. the thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances slarted up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oclth .— He roused himself, hc could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up that image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask conce ring Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the dissembly of a near relationship. leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and they gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himsols, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by soveral, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, whon one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him lhose features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's clrm, and, with hurried slep, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while being engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to bim —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not daro to turn, but, hurrying his fister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. Is before his mind being absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it being rossed, now that the certainty of the monster living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him toexplain to bear what had caused his bankruptcy conduct. He only ultered a few words, and those lerrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him ;—was he then to allow this monster to roar, bearing a river upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not utter its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break a hif oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe a bim? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been knocked. For days, he remained in this state; shook up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes slreaining with lears, bought them, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he loft hls house, r oomed from street to street, arixiouf to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became distorted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight darnps. He was right longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he said him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. This sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absonce the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter clgain into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forowarn, in spite of the hls oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimocy. But when he entered into a roorn, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from sceking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, reconstitution proved unclvalling, the guardians thought proper to inlerpose, and, searing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys pare-\nThe next.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encounter in his wanderings, clnd of preventing him from ex posing to the general eye those mark of what they considered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became a laft so great, though he was confined to the bis chamber. There would often lie for days, the incapablo of being roused. He had becomeemaciated, if eyes had atlairied a glassy luslre ;— the only sign of affection arid recolleclion rernaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that sevorely affslected her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, the only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he ran into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This closed many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherenees became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon bis fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly been elopsed. When, upon the last day of the year, one of the hls guardians entering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstarice of Aubreyf being in so awful a siluation, where his sister was going to be a marri ed. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intersection, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Mclrsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He will apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted wclrmth, arid tocongratulate her upon her marriago with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockct upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the lhc features of the monster who hod so long influenced his life. He selected a portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him by he thus destroyed the resemlance of her fulure husband, he looked as he did riot understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on ber with a srantic expression of countenance, hc bade her swclr that shc would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voiee again bade him remember his oath—he tvmed suddenly round, In the meantime, the guardians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was about a return of his disorder, entered, and foreing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing that to the insanity, they irritated, had takeri possession of his mind, endeavored to pacify him, arid rotired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refreshed with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deceived insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly he concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by correctant atlendance, and the pretence of great coffee-\ntian for their brother and interest in this culture, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to record.\nnt — could speak of himself af of an individual having no sympalhy with any being ori tbe crowded earth, fave with her to whom he addressed himsels ;— could tell her, since he knew her, his existence, had bogun to seem worthy of presentation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent art, or such was the will of fate, that he married her affections. The title of the elder brain falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the inarriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged structure ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continuarit.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted a bribe the servants, but in the rain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sisler, conveying her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the bope of their house, to delay bvt for a few hours that morrioge, on which he denounced the most heavy cursos. The servants promised they would deliver it; bvt giving it to the ph ysician, he thought it was a botter riot to harass any moro the mind of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may make easily be canceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning time, and the sound of corriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcamo their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a belpless old woman. Hc scizcd the opportunity, with one bourid was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were formerly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceiue him: he immediately approached, and, taking a bird around by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your father and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towa rode his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, bad came in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; this rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was changed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as physiciari, was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the efficacy of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardian might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he realized completely what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthveri had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had a great thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONSRESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board the arrival of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the honor of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—bolh men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for hips bound to Smyrna, its bounties amplyrepay for the deviation of a voyage. Wc cleaned; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men wore employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with tbc nations, the clergymen and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small manuscript so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the islarid four days proviaus to our arrivol in his felucca. \"He erigagged me as a pilat\" said to be Greek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mityleno, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), arid has reslded there about fifteen months, though not constaritly; for he sails in his field very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had refided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of sour apartments on the ground-floor—an entranco hall, a drowing-room, a sitting floor, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble lables on the other side, a large m yrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dazen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread from the floor, with two stuffed cotton qullts arid a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, fortunately, the old man told us, silled with books and paperf, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examination the contents. On the tablet of therocess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Russcau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Katzehues novels; Schillerf play of the Robbors; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edilion, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Italian. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, which also were remarks.\nThe ald man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening because he sailed, and fargot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, which would frown me for a week together; how ls otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have the product of this farm sor the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and from the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know about what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and sourteen broad, and the flutcd marble pillars with black plinths and frel-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecicln architecture ,) were considered higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrode, was covered by a fine Turkish carpot, beneath an awning of a strong coarse lin en. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, cls we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusterling together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtlo bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings arid nights till twelve clock, r eading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, before Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards lod the eycto Mount Calcla, couered with olive and myrtle to rose in bloom, and on the summit of which is aricient. The Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smallstream issuing from the ruiris descended in broken collapses, until it was last in the roads near the mountain base. The sea smooth glass glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single oloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were frvitless as to the naine of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I daro not\". We had no time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt a feveral particular of the isolated lard. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weoving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave G Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to vs, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and influential character. One circumstance we collect, which our old friend at the college thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought a piano-forlc, and taught her himself to use it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations oll on the rack, guessing how this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposilion, and all those celebrities which mark peculiar goriius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were displayed. Falling in comparison with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"aboul whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordships fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some future day; but that time that day would neuer retum. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresling, and ln iustice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slaridered. He has been described as ari unfeeling disposition, averse to assoeiating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anocdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in the lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosam. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking hiin as a being on the house heart Religjon hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countrymari. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are eager to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who daresjustify himself before that awful criminal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is the world of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "40": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstitlon upon which this tale is founded is a very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: lt did nol, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the eslablishment of Chrlstianity; and it has only assurned its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful ftories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imhibed a certain portion of the blood of their uictims, wbo became emaciclted, lost their ftrength, clnd speedily died of consumptions; whilst these huinan blood-suckers fatteried—and their veins became distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of sympathy, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. Itoppeors, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the plae, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a oertaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Scrvia, hc had been tormented by a vampyrelbvt had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the va This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or lhirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tarmented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been drivved of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhahitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in classes of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and cmitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure cold florid blood. Proof having been thus obliried, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A ftake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which which is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. Thesame measures were adopted with the forces of those people who had previously died from vampyrisn, lest they shauld, in their lurn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal heliefis, that a person sucked by a vampyre, becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in this turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade if here is related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observalions than any other instance which could be advanced. In many parts of Greece it is considered a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crirne cominitted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but complicated to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon carth—those to whom he was bound by ties ofkindrod and affection .— A supposition allowed to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first oneartb, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from just tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of 1 jfe; Yel loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid liuing corse, Thy victims, ere lbey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for the crime must foll, the youngesl, bcst heloved of alI, Shall bless thee with a father's name — Thatward shall wrap the heart in flame!

Of which, in life a lock when shorn affections fondest pledge was worri — But now ls borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with the own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till lhese in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also introduced in his wild blue beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the varnpyre corse of this Arclbiari maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting ham. she loved the best whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of their life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a completetype of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which which pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narralives illustrative of its effects, has put forth from learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMariy curious and interesting noticos on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted toexplanation, and which may now be included by merely remarking, that though the torm Vampyre, if the one ln most genera acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leodors of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. Ho gave upon the mirth around him, could if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attenlion, that might be by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attrlbuted it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; bul fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see hirn, arid thase who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of hif face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emotion of passlon, though its form and out line wore beautiful, many of the femolc hunters afler notorietyattempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affoction: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every rnodesty, or from the strong emotion of passlon But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such will the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that sew knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether wclt wclt itoven overoame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the best of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who usually it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Landon, a young gentleman of the race of Aubrey: he was an orp ban left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duly iner ely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of inercenary subbolterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judginent. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many millincrs' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vicewas lhrown in by Providence morely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we soe in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consifted in the vesting of clothes, which were warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, it was fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and ricb: for these reasons, upon his eritering into gay circles, moriy mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with leasl truth, their languisbing or romping favourites: the daughterf at the sarne time, bytheir brightening cauntenances when he approached, and by their fparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and hls merit. Attached as he was to the rornance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, nat from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, srom which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, was about to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of exterrial objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flottered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveris affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gairiing some informal respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was tiring for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to lake some rapid fleps iri the career of vice lowards putting themselves upon on cquality with the aged, and nol allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, wheriever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasant They consented: Arid Authority immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circle watching.\nHitherto, Avbrey had had a hadno opportunity to study Lord Ruthvens choracter, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conolusioris from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagaband, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough torelieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could notavoid remarking that it was not upon the virluous, reduced to indigence by the misfartunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his l just, or to sink him still deeper in his inquilty, he was serit away with This wos, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the victims, which generally prevajs over the retiring bashfulness of the virtual environment. There was one circumstance about the charity of bis Lordship, which was still more impressed upori his mind: all those vpon whom it wasbestowed, ineuitably found that there was a curse upori, because they were all either led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most violent misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gained with success, except where the knowri sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the fame unchanging face, with which be generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or theluckless father of a numerous family, he thought his very wish seemed forturies law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst da lingling with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he lofts the farmerly affluent youtb, lorn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the soljtude of a dvngeon, the fato that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilsl many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking laoks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present carving. Yet he looks no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from the canuulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experience. Avbrey osten wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, thisnever occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the objeel of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the instant excitement of vairily wishiring to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorlals of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lctters arrived from England, which he opened with eoger impcltience; the first was from his sister, broathing nothing but affeclion; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it hod before ontered into his imagination, there was an evil power rosident in his componion, these seemed to give him sufflcient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, andurged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irroslstiblo powers of seduction, rendered his licontious habits more dangerous to society. It had been disoovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in halred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the parlner of bis guilt, should be hurled from the pinriacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degra dation: in sinc, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since hls departure, \nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character could not yet show a fine bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to inventsome plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the second while, to watch himmore closely, cland to let no slight circumslances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon pereeived, that his Lordship was convincing to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he cheerfully frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarrled female is inet with in society; he will therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrcys eyefollowed him in call his windings, and soon discovered that an assigriation had been appolnted, which would most likely end in the rule of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and hardly asked him his intentions with respect to the lody, informing a bim at the same time that he was aware of his heing about to meet before that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intenlions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an action; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that srom that mornent hc must docline accompanying his Lordshlp in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartmerits, arid calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was proven. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separalion; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHav ing left Rome, Aubrey directed his stepstowards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He thon fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, afhomed of chronicling the deeds of froemen only before slaves, had hidden themsolves beneath the sholtering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pain.\nntcr wisbing to povrlray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any order to think she could belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped olong the mountain side, one would have thought the gazele a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eycof animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the tasto ofan epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, origaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, fhow the wholo beauty of her form, floating cls it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of blm, who forgot the letters which had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the conclusion of her sylph-like figure. Often would be stress falling, as she flitted around, exhibit iri the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he bad before thought of vital importance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffeeted by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wifhed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her nativeplace; she would then describe him thecircling dance upon tbe open pain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in ber infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell bim all the super Her earnestness and apparent belief of whol sbe narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often os she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and declrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femole to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh hor out of such ldle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe She detailed him the traditional appearance of lhese monstcrs, and his horror was inoroafed, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidenccs whieb had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey heganto attach himself more and more to Iarilhe; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women amorig whom he had sought for his vision of romance, when his heart; clnd while he ridiculed the idea of cl young man or English habits, marrying an uneducatedGreok girl, still he found himself more and more cllached to the almost fairy form before him. He would lear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his ohjecl waf attaincd; buthe always found itimpossible to fix his atlention upori lhe rvins around him, whjlst in his mind he retoined on the image that seemed alone with the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Anthony was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctarice; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardiari was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet affected the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very moment. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to rot urn at night, as he just necessarily passed through a waod, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any confideration. They describe it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnical origins, and denouned the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently mado their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his exoursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned tofjrid that his words, inocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there might allow the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupted in his research, that he did not perceive that day-Iight would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warrnerclimates, so rapidly gather inta a tremendovs mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed sar bis delay: but it was too late. Twilight, inthese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced fclr, the power of the storm was abave—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of reft—its thick heavy rain sorced itf way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue sorked lightning seemed to fall arid radlate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a droadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The criminal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brusbwood which surrounds it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide them to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the feeling of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silerit, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockory of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;— he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, gulded him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength segregated superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his eryery tbrew himself upon him, and kneeling vpon his breast, had placed The storm was now still 1; and Aubrey, capable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their strokes fell upon the mud walls, and the lhatch ladcd on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracled him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but whot was his horror, where the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless c orse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was built a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upan her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upori her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teelh hauing opened the voin :—tothis lhe men pointed, crying, simultoneously struck wilb horror ,\" A Vampyre! Varnpyre !\" A litter was quickly forrned, and Aubrey was laid by the side of beer who had lately been to bim the object of so many bright and sairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise that had died within her. He kriew nat whot his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed arid seerned to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon made by different parlies who had been engaged in the scarch of her when a mother had missed. Their painful cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaecountable eombincltion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rvlhvcn, chonced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever molive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became the bls constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now compared with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault last had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled him to his prefecture. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so aftonished Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to ho rapidly, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but thif smile haunted him. During the last stage, other invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in making the progress of those orbs, circling, like over the world, the movelefs svn ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit, which once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was naw as much a lover of solilude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wifhed for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood 0s Athens; if he sought it against the ruins, he had formerly frequented, Ianthes forin stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the uriderwood, in quest of tbe modefl violet; then suddenly tur-\nning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pull face and wounded throat, with a warm smile upon herlips. He determined to play scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender order he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a collection could be attached: but though they also hadtened the frame to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to sligbt these reports, which they engaged were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enlering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was lbe bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock brought down from the nelghbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and they echoed the report of feveral guns. In an instant, their guards held them, and, placing themsolves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retircd for a moment bebinding the sheltering turn of the desile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a fae, who with insulting shovts bade them advance, and being cxposed to unresisting slavghter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forword ln search of the energy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Steven received a sbot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his woundod friend to a neighbouring cabin; and bavirig agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presentco — they being entent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ru, the strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the object about him: but lowards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual. earnestness — Assist me!! you may saveme—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's bonour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs place — I cannot explain the whole — but if yav would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death were unknown sor some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\" shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature sears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubroy; he sunk loughi. Long upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumslances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered hif oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of somethinghorrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a ro bber met him, and lnformed him that it was no longer thero, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon retiring, to the pinriaole of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rosc after his death. Aubroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lcly. But, when he hadmounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robhers were they pointed out the idenlical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his friend was bewildered in conjectures, but he at lost returned, convinced that they had buried the corpsc for the sake of their clothes.\nWeary of a country which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that svperstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otrarito, or to Naples, he copied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alaghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—bastening to gain further proof, befound the w eapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath which held his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—thoy seemed gazing to he bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particulor form, the same varyling tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left rio roorn for doubt; there were alfo drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and his way home, in Rome, his first inquirjes were concerned that the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been accused of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of nature. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, af lf he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to bis will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and be hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of this sister, all the memory of the past. If she be fore, by her infariline caresses, child gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still inoro attaching as an acompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had nol that winning grace which goes the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. Thero was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a meancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coriscious of a brighter realm. Her sleep was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sodate arid pensive. When a colleague, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but where her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed bis rest, who would have excharigod her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yel only eighteen, and had not been prosented to the world. It had been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the noxt drawing-room, which was the first approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene .\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the melancholy which overpawered him. He could not feel interested in cloud. the frivolities of fashionoble strangers, when his mind had been to torn by the events he had wished; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-rooin.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all the wbo were anxious that bask in the smile of reality, hastened thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of clll around him, engaged in the remembrance that the sirsl time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that veryplace—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oclth .\" He bod hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little dislclence, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, which was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his bands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that that would be real 1— he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he oltempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the namo hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a sew night after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the heprotection of a electron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he refused himself, and entering another room, found his sister svrrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted topass and got near her, when one, whom requested to move, turned around, and revealed to him those features he most ahorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced ber towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of scrvants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in pafsing them, he again heard that the voice whispor close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almosttracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the reality of the monsters living again presfed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention wore now unheeded, and it was in vain that she introduced him to explain to her what had caused his obrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, afraid those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert itspragress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free this world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shook up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister carne, who, with eyes, strearning with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At least, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from the street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wondered, as often exposed to the rioon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever faligue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they wore soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer after that any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend, ainongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of this oath, all whom Lord Revheen approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered a room, his haggard and suspensive looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister waf at least obliged to beg of him to ahstain from seeking, for her sake, a saciety which affected bim so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, searing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high lime to resume again thal trusl which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey parents.\nDesirausof saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouritered in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to the general eye, those marks of what they confidered folly, they erigaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conftant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely he said his mind was covered by one terrible subject. This incohererice became at last so great, that he wasenfined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, the incapablo of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had atlained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remcljning difplayed itself upon the eritry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afslicted her, he would desire her riot to touch him. \"Oh, do riot touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he sank into a state, when not even if she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, the year was passing, his incoherenees became a loss frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its glaom, whose guordions observed, thal several limes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and their smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last doy of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with his physician upon the melclnchaly circumstance of Aubreys being in so as a situatlori, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly. ct: Aubrey attenlion was altracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared have been deprived, they mentioned the name of the star of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonjshed them still more by thus expressing his intention to be a present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but only a few minutes. The best his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her Iovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing out the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feolings of affeclion. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at holding the features of the monster who had sa long influence on his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplod it under a fool. Upon he asked him why he would destroy the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then sejzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wear this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him rememberhis oath—he turried suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entored, arid forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Avbreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he loarned that he was deemed insane, his exultotion arid pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the center of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils that recount—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with a harry being on the crowded earth, save with hor to whorn he addressed himself ;—could tellhow, since he knewher, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listori to be soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or fuch wos the will of fate, that he The title of the eIder brarich falling at length to him, he obtclined an important embasfy, which servedas an excuse for hastening tbe marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiorian and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pon and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring ber, as she valued her own bappiness, her own honour, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their shape and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harcless any more the mind of Miss Aubrey, hy, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed without rest than the bvsy ininates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiasity of the servants at last overcame their violence, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the study of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perccive him: he immediately approached, arid, taking his arm byforce, hurried hiin from the rooin, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my brido to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendees, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was changed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, or the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemriized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near collapse of death. He desired his sister guardlans might be called, arid when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but where they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sisler had glutted the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Theworld was all before him, were to choose the right place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through Blue Grecicln Archipelago, on board one of his Majestys vesself, in the year 18 l 2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of thethal name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British uessels to ujsit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bottles amply repay for the devlatiori of a voyage. We larided; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cove called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small musical so named) we met with and en gaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he bad come from Scio with an English lord, who left this island four days previous to our arrival in his club. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, bclongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wino-trader, six hundrod zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for hc sails in his club very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account exciled our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting floor, and a hed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble lables on either side, a large myrtle in the corner, and a small foundation beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Vonus in a leaning poster; a large oouch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-cose: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber held merely a large matt dress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a morble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think oursolves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeclres, Boileaus, and Rovsseau works complete; VolneyfRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klapsloek's Messiah; Kotzebues novols; Schjller's play of the Robbers; Millon Paradise Lost, ari Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; seueral small pamphlets from the Groek press at Constantiri Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with cell peneil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\" The lord had been read-up.\nif these books were evening before he sajled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders. He would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought a beer from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces looking and fourteenbroad, and the fluted mclrble players with hlack plinths and fret-work connections ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) wore considerably higher than the roof. ct: The roof, surrourided by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnisbed, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma ehristi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the blue shade of two large moortlc hushes, a marble scat with an ornainental wooden back waf placod, on which we were told, lhe lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for his very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from thisseat was what may be termed \"a birdeye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with olive and myrtle treos in bloom, and on the summil of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic Deccly. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smootb cls glass, and an horizon urishadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; clnd a little ori the left, through a vista of lofty chesnul ond palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view rather than I did this; but our enemies were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I care\" he said ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the American, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolaled lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses, love others, and ootton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstanco we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought the proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, which whom the lord was often seenwalking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her to bimself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we separated from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the clock, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philarithropy of disposition, and also those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrivod at Paromo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pilot of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; Imet him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the cause of Calcla iri every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we confused ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, bolieving is not quite uninteresting, and in iustice this lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, clever to assoclating with human nature, or contributing in any way to smooth its sorrows, or adding to this pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little onecdates. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat. write his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to judge all his actions: and his courting the repose of society is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Relloon hath set her seal, and over whose head Benovolcnce hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding passing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cclutiori, particularly when directed against man moral irilegrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful trihunal where all mustappear, alone may censure the errars of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is the world of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testirnony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-sleet.",
    "41": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Ainong lhe Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, oxtoriditself to be Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could riot correct if bvried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the yovng and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrajne, where the bolief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of theirvlctims, who became emaeiated, losing their slrength, and specdily died of consumptions; whilst thesehuman blood-suckors fatlened—clnd their veiris became distended to such a state of repletion, as to\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrlsm, which is started to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-ehief and magistrates of the place, they posilively and unanjmously affirmed that, at Cassovicl, on the fronliers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth over the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about lwenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was mode, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulled their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisrn) fresh, and entirely free from corruplion, clnd emitling all the mouth, nosc, and ears, pvre and florld blood. Proof having been thus obtclined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person scacked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in a high turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is better related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishmerit after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to corifine his infernal visitations solely to those beingshe loved most while upon earth—those to whom he wasbound by ties of kindred and affection .— A suppositionalluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, slster, wife, At rnidnight drain the stream of llfe; Yet loclthe the banquct which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy viclims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the de But one shall for the crimo must fall. The youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless the with a father's name me — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye 1clst spark, And the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The trefses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shom Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is come away hy the Mcinorjal of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Tben stalking lo thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till there in a ferror shrink away from spectre more aocursed than they.\nMr. Sovthey has also introduced in a wild blue beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire curse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting whom she best loved wealth in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrayed throughout the whole of the tale of a complete type of purity and innooence. The ueraoious Tournofort gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vampyrism, also which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of aneodoles, and traditionary norratives illustrativo of its effects, has put sarth some leorned dissertations, tending to prove it to be an elassical, as well as barbaricln error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly boring superstition might be added; though the present may susflce for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mere ly remarking, that though the lerm Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with il, rnade use of in various parts of the world: of Vrouc0locha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broueoloka, &\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendarit upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the story, a noblemari, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could riot participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by could look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness relgned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the obiccts face, did riot seem to penetrate, arid at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heort; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skln it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of the ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gairied a warmer tint, either from the blusb of modesty, or from lhes strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were helpful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to wiri his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term clsfection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of euery monster shewri in drawing-rooms since her marrlclge, t But although the common adults could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virluaus wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that girl. even overcame lhod read of his singular character, or that they were moved by this apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sox srom their domestic virlues, as among those who sully it by their vicef.\nAbout the same time, there came to Loridon, the young gentleman of the name of Aubroy: he was an orphan left with only sister in possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought il their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind tolhe care of mercenary subalticrns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many millinerf apprentices. He believed all to sympalhise with virtue, and though the vico was thrawn in by Providence inerely for the pieturefque effeot of the scene, as we sec in rornances: he thought that tbo misery af a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of elothes, which were af warm, but which were better odapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in line, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their langujshing or roinping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening conlenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon Ied him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached os he wcls lo the rornance of his solilary hives, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the preserice of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of plcasing pictures and defcriptions contained in those uolumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his devoted vanity, he was able to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched hjm; and the very impossibllity os forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of extemal objects, than the taoit assent ta their existence, irnplied by the avoidance of heir contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soari formed this object into the hero os o romance, and delermined to He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. De sirovs of gaining some information respecling this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations have been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stops in the career as vice tawards putting themselves upon equality with the aged, and only allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or af praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in coinmori with other mons, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the ciroling letters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his aclions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— tbe idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtvous, reduced to indigence by the mlsfortunes attendarit even upon vi rtue, that he beslowed his alarms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; hut when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his warits, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the uirtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, irreuitably found that there was a curse uponil, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his eompanion sou ght for the centres of all sasbionable vice; there he entered irito alI the spirit of the soro table: he betted, clnd always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was bif antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which whioh he generally In every town, he left the forinerly affluent youth, tarri from the circle he adorned, cursing, ln the solitude of a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him within the reaoh of this friend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the faking looks of a frank hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to falisfy their present croving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, this last gilder he had just snatched from theconvulsive grafp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to rosing that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own prosit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he haped his friend would give bim some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carrlage, and amidst the various wild andrich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and lhough Aubroy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wanting to break that mystery, which that his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the rnorning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost desertedcity. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sifter, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardlans, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in hif companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urgod, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his loentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratitude, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of jnfamy and degradation: in fine, that all those semales whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had only yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumftances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soori perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the experience of the daughter of the lady whoso house he chiefly vented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plaris in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, arid soon discovered that ari assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rutbven, and abruptly asked him his interitions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very right. Lord Ruthveri answered that his intentions were such as he supposed also would have upon such an accasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and immediately write-\ning a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartmonts, clnd calling upon the mother of thc Iady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicious of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori occupied himself in trocing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparent-\nonly, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidderi themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many color ured lichen. Under the same roof of himself, existed being, so beautiful and dellcate, that she might have formed a lhe made for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful iri Mabometal paradiso, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for arily one to think she could belong to those who hold no souls. As she danced upon the plantri, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of beer beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of ariimated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of ari eplcure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his searh after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in this pursuit of a clumber butterfly, showed the whole beauty of ber form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaoed tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she felt around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escope from his mind lhe very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausonias. But why attempt to describe charms with all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocenee, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew thoso remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pcricil, in touching the scenes of her ncltive place; she would then describe him the clrcling dance upori the open plain, would paint, to bim in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered vjewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greclter Her eornestness and apparent belief of whal sho narrated, excited the jnterost even of Aubrey; and often as sbe told him that tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amldst his friends, and dearest ties, feed every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the erisuing montbs, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted lo lavghhor She detoiled to him the traditional appearance of these monstors, and his borror was iricreasod, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted iri persuadling ber, though at the same time he worked at the mariy coincidenees which had all tended to excite a belicf in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; hor innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of this woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romarice, won his hoart; clnd while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englifh habilf, marrying ori uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attoched to the almost foiry form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his attention was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained on the image that seemed alone the rightful professor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uneonscious of his love, and was evor the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluetance; but it was because he had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had applied to her parents on the subject of companies, and they both, with several parents, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of hisexcursions, which would to describe him for a few hours; when they heard the riame of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must nooessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resorl of the vampyres in their nocturnal order, and denounced those most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made Iight of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, inferrial power, the very name of which apparently made their bload freezc, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancboly faco of his hoft, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his harse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these things to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in this research, that he did not perceive that doy-light would soon end, arid that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gatheririto a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon lhe devoted country .— He at last, however, inounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night hegins: and ore he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its holding thunders held scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lighting soemed to fall and radiale at his very feet. Suddenly, a hif horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful cripidity through the entangled forest. The animal at least, through satigue, slopped, and he found, by the circle of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead Ieaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, hc approached, hoping to find someone to give him to the town, or at least trusting to ohtoin shelter from the pelting of the stor m. As he collapsed, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the droadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again  He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of them. He found himself in contact with some one, when he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Againbaffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determlended to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself tovorctly torclting through the hole that gave The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the ground walls, and the thatcb loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soft. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturhed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, scratched by his sido. There was no colour upon her cheek, not evon upon her lip; yet there was stillnefs about her face that seemed almost to attach as the lise that once dwelt lhere :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having operied the vein :—lo this the men pointed, crying, simultoneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knows not what his thoughts.\nthis was—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—heheld almost continuously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their comfortable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but where they ascertained the cause of their child death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed wos seized with a most vl olent fever, and was often deli rious; inthese inlervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianlhe—by some unaccountable comhination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. Otherwise, he would improve his inaledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athenf, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was borrified and startled at the sight of him whose knowledge he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kindwords, implying almost repentance for the fall that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, onxie ty, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescerice began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious oxultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those words, clrcling, like our warld, the reverseless sun ;—in-\ndeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that the elafticity of spirit which had once sa diftinguished bim now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitvde and filence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athenf; it would be sought it in the ruiris he had farmerly frequerited, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he sought it in lhe words, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, iri quesl of the modest violet; their suddenly turning rourid, would show, to He determined to flyscenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender circle he had taken of him during his illness, that they should utilize parts of Greecc neither had yet seen. Beytravelled in evory direction, and sought every spot to which a recolleclion could be attacked: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard such robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they deferided from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guidef than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring preeipices, they had roclson to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistleling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had a lestthem, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sbeltering turn of the defile: but ashained of being thus detairized by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advanee, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robb ers should climb above and lake them in the rear, they determined at once to reach forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to his assistance; clnd, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' face around him — his guards baving, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; a clandhaving agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their prefence — they boing content merely to guard the entrarice till their comrade should return with the promiscdsurn, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the morality ensucd, and death seemed odvancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed to be unconscious of pain as he had beeri or the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently urieasy, and his eye oft been fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer hif assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more plan that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you wanna save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little —my life ebbs apaee — I cannot explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of mo, my hanour were free srom stain iri the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England —I —6 full life. \"—\"It shall riot be known. \"—\"Swear!\" ordered the dying man,raisirighimself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, sweartbat, sor a year and a dcly you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may seo. \"— His eyes seemed hursting from their socketf :\"I swa r !\" said Aubrey; he said laughing upon this pillow, and breathed rio more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered bis oath a cold shlvering came over a hirn, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting a bim. Rising early in the morning, being was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no loriger there, having been conveyed by him-\nself and comrades, upon his retirement, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mourit, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold race of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and buy it upon the spot where it lay. Bvt, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the eorpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had land the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which also apparently conspired to heighten that svperslitious melanchaly that child scized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whilo waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthuen. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to onsure the death of the victim. There were several doggers around the attacks. Whilst tvrning thein over, and exarniniring their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornclmented in the same slyle as the dagger discovered iri fatal hut—he shudderod—hasteniring to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and hls horror may be imagined whether he was discovered that lt fitted, though peculiarly shoped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wisbed to disbelieve; hut in particular form, the same varying tints upon the hast and shoath were alike in splondour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to stretch from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been beard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken undor so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation corrected in urging the speed of lhepostilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shops; and he hastened to the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and coresses of his sisler, all the memory of the post. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affectlan, and now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attacking as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey had not thought of winning grace, which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up the levity of the mind beneath. There was a molancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strclys where a bitterly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, the cheek face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breat hed to her his affeolion, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile sor that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing the iri light of their owri native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fine that her presentation should be dolayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-roorn, which was fast approaching, should be the epocb of her entry into the \"busy stone\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strarigers, when his mind had been so torn by the events which had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-roam had riot being held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastcened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in a very place — he fell himself suddenly seized by the arm, arid a voice he recognized too well, sounded in hif ear —\"Reinember your oath .\" He had hard courage to turri, fearful of seeing a spectre thal would blaft him, when he proved, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on his spol upon his first entry into focus. He walked till his limbs almost refusing to boar their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, who threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried stops, and fixed his harids upon his head, as if he were afraid, his thoughts were bursting from his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstanc es started up in a dradful array—the dagger—his oath .—Ho roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real —he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, arid he would not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near reality. Leaving her under the proteclior of a matron, he retirod into a recess, and they gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found this sister surrourided by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass arid get near her, when one, whom he resolved to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, selzed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself inpcded by the crowd of servants wbo were waiting for their lords; clnd while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard thal voice which close to him —\"Remomber your oath !\"— He did not darc to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainly of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentians were now unheeded, and just was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was a bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? Hi, very first might have been touched by this thing. But even if he were to break his oath, and discuss his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the way world from such a witch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remains in this state; shul up in his room, which saw no one, and ate only whon his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness anditude, left his house, roamed from the street to streel, anxious to fly that image which haun-\nct: told him. His dress became neglecled, and he wondered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first, he returned with the oven to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever satigue overlooks him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursver swifter than any — from thought. His concept, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence, the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconsclous, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewam, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he enlered irito room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstranoe proved unauailing, the guardians thought proper to int-\nproper, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of sauing him from lhe inju rics and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposed to the general eye lhose marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice just, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confident of his character. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, bis eyes hold attained a glassy lustre ;— the only slgn of affection and recollection remaining displaycd itself upon the entry of his sister; then be would sometimes slart, and, seizing her harids, with looks that severely afflictod her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do riot go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he recovered, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sank into a stote, whence not even she would rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohererices became less frequent, and his mind threw off a porlian of its glaom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had rarely elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with his physiclan upon the melanchically circumstance of Avbreys being in so awful a situation, when his sifter was going the next day to be married. Instantly, every attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of the relevant intellect, of which they formed, he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking if a young Earl whom he had met with iri society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis inlention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his fister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently an angel capable of being affected by the insluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to bls breast, and kissed her c beek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's hearing once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warrnth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the fortunes of the monster who had so long Influenced his life. Ho s eizod the portrait in a paroxysm of a circle, and tr ampled it under the soft. Upon her asking her why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand ber—then sejzing her hands, and gazing at her with a franlic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that sbe would never wed this monfter, sor he—But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but so In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a returri of his disorder, entered, defending him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knowledge to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing that to the infanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacjfy bim, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he reads himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultalion and pleasure would hardly be coricealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former company, orid, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hls tongue hod dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded carth, fave with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use lheserpents art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affection The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served af an excvse sor hastening the marriage ,( in spile of her brother's deronged state ,) which was to take place that very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician, arid his guardians, attempted to bring the servants, but in vain. He asked for peri and paper; it was given him; hewrote a letter to his fister, conjuring her, as shevalued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of thase now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, ori which he developed the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Misf Aubrey by, what he considered, the teachings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubroy heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of baby preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcome theirvigilance, they gradually stole away, loaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized theapportiony, with onebound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear — Remember your oath, and know, if not iny bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are sroil !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his atteridants, who, roved by the old woman, bad came in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, hold broken blood-vessels, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was only present when he entered the physician, was afraid of agitating her. The marriage will be slemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Landon.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight bour had slruok, he related composedly what the reader had peruscd — he died immediately after.\nThis guardianf hastened to protect Miss Avbrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was also before him, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grccian Archipelago, on hoard one of his Majesty's uessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, introduced many British vessels to visit it—hot meri of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, the bottom of the bay, arid whllst themen were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homers Schoo l, and other places where we had beer before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so riam ed) we met with and engoged a young Greek of our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an Englishlord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me in a pilot ,\" said there ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mityl once, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. Tho oottage over the hill, facing the river, 6 elongs to him, arid he has left an old mcln in charge of it: he gave Dominick, thewine-trclder, slx hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourtcen montbs, thoughnot constarity; for he sails in his felueca very often to the difserentislands.\"\nThis occourit excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in chatting to the house where our countryman had rosided. We were kindly received by an old man, who corrected us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlaur, arid a bed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grecn-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtlein the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in theside of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, called an empty bookcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large matt.\nThe dress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with hooks arid papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shokspearef, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmormcln, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebves novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Miltons Parad is Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; sevoral small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much tor Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, iri, Italian and Latin. The Messich was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he ,\" Therefore they must live until his return; for her is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; be is otherwise very good. I did him a service; and I had the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechinof which I paid to an aged Armenlan who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paoes long arid fourteen broad, and the futed marble pillars with black plinlhs clnd fret-work connections ,( as it is now customary in Grecicln arcbitecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, af upon them, the Greeks pass their euenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the loft hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet grilled away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an arnamental woaden back was placed, ori which we were told, the lordpassed many of his evenings and nights till twelvo clock, reading, writing, and talking to himfels. \"I suppose,\" said the old mari ,\"playing\" for me was very devoul ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this site was what may be called \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eyc to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and mystical trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in the broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in sront; and a little on the left, through the avista of lofty chesnut and palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoy a video more than I did t his; but our enquiries were fr ujtless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: noc know his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenlon\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friends ?\" said I —\"If I couldn\" said to him ,\" I dare not .\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but an our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He was portioned eight young girls who he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, a cold coltan and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a freshman who had loft his own in a college, and he often gave Greek Teslaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very energetic and beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought the proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was oftenseen walking on the seashore, and he should buy her a piano-forte, and taught her to use it.\nSueh will the inforrnation with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all over the rack, guessing who this rambler is Greececould be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived atPalerino, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt arid Groece ,\"Tbe individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrn; I met him in my travels on the island of Tonedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been sorne years from home; hut \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the reoluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious about your research at the cottage, but we consaled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and injustice to a high lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfceling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to smooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be finally gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, as elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their soul in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling a proud of him as a covritryman. With respect to his leaves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reporls are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who daref jvstify himself before that awful tribunal, where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest telimony of a virtuous hoarl and self-approving confidence.\nTHE END!\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "42": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tole.\nBy Jonathan Poidori.\nTHE fuperstition upon which this talk is a frog is very generous in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did nol, however, extend itself to the Greeks unlil after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumod its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idoa becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not be corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, clnd Lorraine, where the belief oxisted, that vclmpyres nightly imbibed acertain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, aridspeedily diod of consurnptions; whilst tbese human blood-suckers fattened—arid their veins beeame distended to such a state of\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a serious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular oase of varnpyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Malaysia, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the coinmander-in-ehief and magistrales of the place, they positively and unanimovsly affirmed that, about five years before, o certclin Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way torid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his allacks. To prevent surther rnisohief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, arid found it (as is supposed to be usual in cosos of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from correction, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus oblained, they reforted to accustomed comedy. A stake was drivenentirely through the heart arid body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been olive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes intohif grove. The same measures were adopted with the course of thase porsons who had previously decided from clumpyrism, 1 cst they should, in their turn, become agenls upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nThe Chief Cliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is more related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishinent after death, for some heinous crime eoinmitted whilst in existence, that thc decoased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to co nfine his unfornal visilations solely to tbose beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition alluded lo in tbe\nBut first on the earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Theri ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wi fe, At midnight drain the stream of lifo; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must face thy livid living corse, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall know tho demon for their sire; As curs The flowers are wilhered on the stein. But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless lhee with a father's name — That word shall wrap by heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glossy glance must view Whieh freezes over its blue; Tben with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock when shorn Affection's second pledge was worn — But now is borne awcly by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood sball drip; Thy gnashing toalh, clnd haggclrd lip; Theri stalking ta thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gou 1s and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from speclre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beclutisul poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyrc corse of the Arablari maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Toumesort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, arid traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, helps put forth some Iearned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present inay suffice for the limits of a nate, necessarily devoted to explanation, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyrc is lhe onc in mosl general acceptance, there are several others syrionymovs with il, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, G0ul, Bro\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened calm in the midst of the dissipations attend-\nant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. apparently, the light loughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those wbo felt this sonsation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some atlributed it to the dead grey eyc, which, fixing up on the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, arid at ono chance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed uponlhe skin just could not poss. His peculiarities caused them to be invited to everyhouse; they wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of the ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rnodesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though il's farm and outline were beauliful, many of the feinale hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, somc marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, wbo had been the mockory of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent cavtion with which he spoke to the uirtuous wifc and inriocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dreod of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent halred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, t here came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he wcls an orphan lcft with an orphan lcft with an orphan lcft with an orphan lcft with an orphan of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought just their duty more to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the inore important charge of bis mind to the circle of mercenary scandals, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, a bounce, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed clll to fympathise with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown in by Provjdence merely for the picturosque effect of the scene, as we sce in romances: he thought that themisery of a cottage merely consisted on the vesting of clothes, which were as worm, but whlcb were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of photos were the realities of life. He was handsome, srank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least their langujshing or romping favurites: the daughlers at the same time, hy their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soori led him into false notions of his talerits and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the talk and wax candles that fllckered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, who was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; clnd the very impossibility of forming an idea of the oharacler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacil asfent to their exislenoemimplied by the avoidance of their control: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered itf propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to abserve the offspring of his fcl He became acquainted with him, pald him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rulhvensaffairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the names of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informal respecting this singular character, wbo, still now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was tiring for him to perform the tour, which for many generations have been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid sleeps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous iritrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and A ubrey immediately mentioning his permissions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, but apparently, bad nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to be conducted. This companion was profuse in his liborality ;— tbe idle, vagabond, and tho beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immodiate wants. But Averry could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misforlunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, nat to relieve his wantf, but to allow him to fta wallow in his lust, or to sink him ftill deepor in his inquity, he This will, however, attracted by him to the greater impartunity of the uicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom will be bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brvssels and other towns through which they passed, Auhrey was svrprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought sor the cen tres of all fashionable vice; there he entered irito all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gclmblod with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the fame unchanging face, with which he generally watohed the sac In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circlo be adorned, oursing, ln the solitude of a dungeori, the fate that had drawri hirn within the reach of this friend; whilst many cl father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith lobuy even sufficien to satisfy their prefent craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guard he had just snotched from the convulsive grasp of this innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey aften wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charily and pleasure which proved the rujn of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delclyed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never oocurred. Lord Ruthven in his corriage, and almost the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey waf riear the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from il than the coristant oxcitement of vainly wanting to break that myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, andAubrey for a time lost sight of his cainpanion; he left home in daily attendance upon the morning circle of Italian countries, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst he was lhusongaged, letters arrived from England, which was opened with eager impatierice; tho first was from his sister, breathing nothing bull clffection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonlshed him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was a cln evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, orid urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of religious powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangorous to society. It bad been discovered that bis conlempt for the adultress had not origirialized in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratlification, that hls victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnocle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation on: in fine, that all those fernaos whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virlue, had, since his departure, thrown\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had riot a single bright point which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning bim altogether, purposing, in this inean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, arid soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he regretted the apartment of Lord Ruthuen, and abruptly asked him to bring his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthvon answered that his intentions were such as supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being presponed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed taur, he ordered a servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assigation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent hisservant to notify his complete absent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Auhreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubreydirected his sleep towards Greeee, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronjcling the deedsof freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many ooloured lichen. Under the same roof clshimself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, savo that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plane, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the ga2elle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchariged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the last of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, ond oflen would the uriconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttersly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floclting as it were upori tbe wind, to the eclger gaze of him, who forgot thc lettcrs he had just decypherod upon an almost effaced tablet, iri the coritemplation of her sylp Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exbibit in the sun ray such delicately brillianl and swistly fading huos, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It wasinnocenco, youth, arid because they are unaffocted by crowded drawing-roams and still balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial sor his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open ploin, wauld paint, to him in all the glowing colors of youthful memory, the inarriage point she remembered viewing in ber infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greclter impression upon her mind, would to Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrclted, excited the interest even of Avbrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst hlood would run cold, whilst he attracted to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been faund marked with the stamp of the friend's appetite; and when shc found him so uncrcdulous lo believe her, for it had been, remarked that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror waf increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which hod all tended to excite a b elief in the superriatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, socontrasted with all the offected victims of the women among whom he had fought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greekgirl, still hesound himself more and more ottached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plon for soine antiquarian research, would depclrt, determined not to return until his attention will attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst iri his mind he retained on the image that scemed alone the rightful possessor of his thaughts. Ianthe was uneonscious of his love, arid was ever the same frank information being he had first known. Sbe always seemed to part from him with reluctance; hut it was because she had no longer any one who whom she could visit her favorite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelchirig or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of companies, and they both, with several parents, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Auhrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detoin him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they call at once begged or not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, whereno Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the result of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and developed the most heavy movies as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Auhrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when we saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very riamo of which apparently made their blood freezed, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey fet off upon his excursion unattonded; bo was surprised to observe the melancholy saee of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking themselves of those horr-\nble friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to retum, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be pvt in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warincr climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mclss, clnd pour all their rage upon thedevoled country .— He at last, bowever, mounted bis horse, determinod to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is cllmost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was about —its echoing thuriders had scaredly an interval of the crust—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to foll and radiale at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stop-\npped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hospital that hardly left itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the lown, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dradful shrieks of a womon mingling with the stifled, exultant mackery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he started: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his hoad, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He sounds himself in utter darkness: this sound, however, guided him. He was apparently experienced; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found bimsels in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a volce cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grapplod by one whose strength soemed superhuman: dotermiried to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemythrew himself upon him, and kneelirig upon his throat The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of imagining, was soori heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and lhe thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flavor of sool. At the desire of Aubrey they scarched for her who had attracted him by her cries; be was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches ance more bursl upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, haping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, slretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upan her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost cls attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon ber neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to that the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struok with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly farmed, and Avbrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were —his mind was benumbed and seeined to shun reflection, and toke rofuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his band, a naked dagger of a partlcular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of a mother whom had finished. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were iriconsolable; both died broken-bearted.\nAvbrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was osten dellrious; in three intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iclnthe—by some unaccouritable combination he seemed to beg of his foreign companian to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would im precate mclledictions upon his head, and curse him as a hard destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Atheris, and, from whatever motive, upon bearing of the state of Aubroy, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his co-\na small attendant. When the latter recovered from his delivery, he was horrifled and startlod at the sight of him whose image he had now ombbined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthveri, by his kind words, impIying almost repenlance for the fault that bad c caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Avbrey; but os soon cls his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from this former man, except thal at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a srnile of malieious exultation playing upon bis lips: he knew nat why, but this smile haunte During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was happy.\nrentedly engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coo-\nling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movcless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished this name seemed to have fled for ever. Ho was now as much a lover of solitudo and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solilude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he saught it in the woods, her light step would appear wondering amldst the underwood, jn quest of the modesl violet; then suddenly turning rovrid, would show, to his wild imaginalion, hcr pale face ondwounded tbroat, wltb  He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitler associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither hold yet soon. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollectian could be atlached: but though they thus hostoned from place to place, yet they seemed right to beed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from protended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the choice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve cls guides than as a defenc e. Upan entering, howcver, a narrow defile, ot the boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rack brought down from neighbouring precipioes, they had reasori to repent their negligence; for scarcely wore the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were start In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had a gun to sire in the direction when the repart came. LordRuthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of thedefile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advarice, and being exposed to unrcsisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot on the shoulder, which brought a bim to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asfistance; and, no longer heoding the contest or hif own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvenf being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surchargerod.\nBy promises of great rewclrd, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighboring cabin; and baving agreed upon a rclrisom, he was no more disturhed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised fum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; iri two days martification ensued, and death seemed to be dividing with those steps. Hjs conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, hls inind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earriestness —\"Assist me! you may save mc—you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of a rny existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my bonour, your friends bonour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would doany thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but little — my life ebbs opace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes of death to any living being in anyway, whatever may happen.\na pen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes feel bursting from their sockets :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk Iaughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey relred to rest, but did not sleop; many circumstances attonding hif acquaintance with thif rnan rose upon his mind, and he knew nat why; wheri remembered his oatb a cold shivering came over him, as if srom the presentiment of the same thing horrible awaiting bim. Risjng early jn lhe morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that il was no longer there, having been conveyed by himsels and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of cl neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that roso after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and taking several of the men, decided to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the ideological rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, if the mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupied himself in arranging the above effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhven. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure thedoath of the victim. There were several daggers and attractions. Whilst tvrning thoin over, and examining their curiovs forms, whot was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found a weapon, and his horror may be angled when he discovered that it fitted, though a peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainly — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieue; but the particular form, the fame varying tints upon the haft and sheath were olike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Roine, the first jnquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to sriatch from Lord Ruthvon's educational arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his leadership. Aubrey's mind became almost broken undor so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this city had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became more innocent and silent; and his only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the pos tilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held a car. He arrived at Calais; a brecze, which seemed obediont l0 his will, soon wafted bjm at the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and lhere, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embroces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caress, she had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had not beat the winning grade which gains the goze and applause of the drawing-rooin assemblies. There was a name of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which stra ys where a butterfly. or colour may attract — it was sedate and penfive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the single ofjoy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forget those gries she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the thal of the uolupluary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face wore, then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by herguordianf more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It wasnow, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fost approachling, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could riot feel intorest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been sa lorn by the events he had witnessed; but to determine to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nct: The crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilc he was standing in a co rner by himself, heedless of all around him, engagod in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place —he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, sourided in bis ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, searful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which hod attracted his nolice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almostrefusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcling a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circstances started up in a dreadful array—thc dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could riot believe it posfible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his tips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to this assembly of a near relationship. Leaving a hor under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own de vovring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were Ieaving, he roused himself, and enlering another room, fourid his souls were surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, undreucaled to him those features he most abhorred. Hc sprang forward, sejzed his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forccd her towards the streel: at the door hc found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again beard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turri, but, hurrying his sister, soan reached home.\nAubrey became almost destroyed. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was just engrossed, now that the certainty of the monstersliviing agairi pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his global conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those trusted her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to a low this monster to roa m, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. Bvl oven if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him he thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his roar, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besaught him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, rio longer capable of boaring stillness and solilude, he left his house, roamed from the street to street, anxious to fly that image of a wbb haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever the station overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly charged. Struck with the idea that he left by hif absenoe the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconsciously, he determined to enter clgain into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, also. whom Lord Luther approached with intimacy. Bul when he entered a room, his haggard and sufpicious looks were so slriking, his inword shudderings so visible, that his sister wcls at last obliged to beg of him lo abstain from seeking, for her sakc, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrancc proved unavailing, the guardianf thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a big time to resume again that trust which had been before impofed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wonderings, the cold of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take conslant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become complicated, his oyes had attoined a glassy lustre ;—thc only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed ilself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that sevorely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him —is your love sor me if you laugh, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, if the only answer was ,\"True !\" and again he sank into the cold state, whence not even fho could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, arid his mind lhrew off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day would count upon his fingers a definile numbcr, and thensmile.\nThis time had nearly collapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was attrocted; he asked anxiously that whom. Glad of this mark osreturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they meritioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrcy seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the insluence of hor lovely smile; for he pressed her to half breast, and kissed her cheek, wel with tears, flowing clt through the thought of her brother's boing once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a persan so distinguished for rank and every accomplishmerit; when he suddenly perceiued a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was a surprise at the behinded features of the manster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed lhc reseinblance or her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then sojzing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of cuntenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monfter, for he — But he could not advanco—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oatb—he tvrned  In the meanlime, the guardians and physic ian, who had hoard the whale, arid thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, deslred her to leave her. He fell upon his knees to him. He implored, he he hegged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to theinsanity, they imagined had taken the possessian of his inind, endeauoured to play him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every order else. When hc heard of Aubrey's health, be readily understood helpful to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exulation and pleasure could hardly be coricealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his formor eompanion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and intcrest iri his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. What could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tolls to recount— could speak of himself as an individual having rio sympathy with any being on theerowded earth, save with her to whom be addressed himself;— could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were mercly that he might listen to a ber soothing accerits ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was to the will of fote, that he gained her affect The topic of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse forhastoning the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and then honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope arid the hope of their house, to delay but sor a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better riot to harass any more l the mlnd of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily concoived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on thestaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my brideto day, your sister is discovered. Women are fair !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendance, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage notfinding vent, had broken blood vessels, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion ofblood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the inidnight hour had struck, he related completely what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardlans hastenod to protect Miss Aubroy; but when they arrive, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND DF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"Tho world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecjan Archipelago, on board orie of his Majesty's uessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of MityIene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cottle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repoy for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst which men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave c alled Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mourit Ida (a small manuscript so named) we met with and changed a young Greek as our guide, who told us he bad come from Sci0 with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. ct :\"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said Groek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did riot choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He is an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time bastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marblo tables on the eitber side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a rolling posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English eane chairs, and an empty book-class: there were no mirrors, nor a fine painting. The bedchamber had nearly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the cammon bod throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with blacks and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplo, much lorn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbed all over, and marked with the sales of the poper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reclding these books the evening before he said, and forgot to place them with both others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise good. I one did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armeniari who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces looking and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and frel-work prices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian archilecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpel, beneath an awning of strongcoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus surriished, close upon them, the Greeks pass their vowings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, os we cnlered the house, a small streclmlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marhle seat with an ornclmental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nighls till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, arid talking to hiinself. \"I suppose\" said the old mon ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestlo decay. A small stream issuing from the ruiris descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an iron unshaded by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesriut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctively observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of em erald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless cls to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick,his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" Could tell, but? I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can,\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit Armenjan, but on our return to the law, we learnt several personalities of the isolated world. He had portioned eight young girls where he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horsesto others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to their poor children. In short, compared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eecenlric and the benefit character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend of the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mityleno; our imagiriatioris all on the rack, giving who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had a philarithropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" sold he ,\"ahout whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordsbips fame, as we had been some years from home; bul \"Childe Horolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the rescue of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we ensoled ourselves with the long idea of returning to Mitylene on the same futureday; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human culture, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrow, or add to its pleasures. The fact ls directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little corrections. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solidarity is an additional reason for marking him as a beingon whose heart Roliglon shall set her seal, and aver whose bead. Benevolence hath thrown her a mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trays\" without feeling proud of him or a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cautiori, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal whero all must appear, alone may censure the errors of cl fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genivs. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, also the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "43": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded if very general is the East. Among the Arabians, it appears to be commori: just did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks unlil after the cstablishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latiri and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that the Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the yo In the West just spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the beef existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain porlion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, arid speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattencd—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from\nIri, the London Journal, of Mareh ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is started to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, lhey positively ond unarilmously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovla, on the frontiers of the Turkish Seruia,he had been tormerited by a varnpyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the cuil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampy This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having a hoen tormented by him, and adeposllion was made, that sour people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitarits hauing consvlted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found just (as is supposed to be usual in cases ofvampyrism) fresh, and entirely fresh from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus abtclined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poll, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same means ures were adopted with the forces of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, iri their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomoritade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observa-\nThetions than any other ingredient which could be introduced. In many parts of Greece it is corisidered as a sort of punishment after death, for the same heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only dooined to vampyriso, but compelled to consine his infernal visitolions solely lo those beings he loved most while on earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection .— A supposition allowed to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Clmpyro sent,Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck lhe blood of all thy racc; There from thy daughter, fister, wifo, At midnight drain the streain of life; Yet loclthe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, ShalI know the demon for But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, shall bless lhee with a father's riame — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou muft end the task and mark Her cheeks 1 aft tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glanee must view Which free zesoer its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in lfe a lack wben shornAffection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is borne oway by the memorial of thine clgony! Yol with thine own best blood shall drip; Tby gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afritsrave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful point of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormentiring whom she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she beingpourtrayed through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The vorclcious Tovrnefort gives a long account in his lravels of severol astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitriess; and Calmet, iri his great work vpon thif fubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionary norratives lllustrative of ils effects, has put farth some learned dissertations, teriding to prove it to be a classical,\nMany curious and interesting notices ori this singularly horrible superstition might be odded; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoled to explanation, arid which may now be concluded by inerely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several other synonymous with it, made use of iri various parts of the world: as Vrovcolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations altendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various porties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the milk around him, as if he could only participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by cl look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where loughtlessness ringed. Those who felt this sensation of clwe, could not explain whence it arose: some atlributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penelrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the iriward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wishes to see him, and those who hod beeri accustomed to violent ex citement, and now forget the weight of the environment pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which neuer gained a warmer tint, either srom the blush of modesty, or from the strong einolion of passion, though its sorin and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters aftor notoriety attempted to win his ottentians, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms sineo her marriage, threw herfelf in his way But though the common adultress could not influence even the evidence of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to hiin: yot such was the apparent action with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even ovorcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his appa rent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as combining those who sully just by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he wos an organ left with an only sister in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought about their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mindlo, the care of mercenary subaltorns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many million apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that voice was thrown iri by Providerice merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we soe in Romanoes: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the final, that the dreams of poets were the realties of life. He will handsome,frank, and rich: for these reasons, preparing his entering into gay circles, rnany mathers surranded hirn, striuing which sbould describe. with lea st truth, their languishing or roinping fauvrites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening eountenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, was startled at finding ng, that, except iri the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghosl, but from warit of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and deseriptions coritained in those volumes, from which he had formed hls study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, whon the extraordinary being we have above defcribed, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit relates to their existence, impljed by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture everything that slattercd its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soonformed this object into the bero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desjrous af gaining some inforination respectling this single character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hlnted to his guardians, that it was time for him to persorm the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the cclroer of vice lowards putting thcmsolves upon an equclly with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallcn from the They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mork of esteem from him, who, apparently, bad nothing is common with other men, be glad adly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, lhat, though many more of his actions were exposed to this view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagclbond, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough to rel-\ngive their immediate wants. Bul Auhrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendclnt euen upon vlrtue, that he bestowed his alarms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; bvt when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sinkhim still deeper in his iniquit This will, bowever, altributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring boshfulness of the virluous indigent. There was one circumstance about the clrity of his Lordsbip, which was still more impressed upon his inirid: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for lhey were all either led to the soaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject mifery. At Brussels and other lowris through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness which his companion sought for the centres of all the fashionable vice; there he ont-\nered inlo all the spirit of the faro tahle: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his colonagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the fine unchanging face, with which he generally watched society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash you-\ntbful novice, or the luckless father of a numerouf family; then hif uery wish secmed fortune's law—this clpparent abstructedness of mind was laid aside, and his oyes sparkled with more fear than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fatc that had drawn him within the reach of this flend; wbilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute h ungry children, without a single farthing of his late jmmense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he looked no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degroe of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved to ruin of all, clnd did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, lbis never ocourred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidsl the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyo spoke less than his Iip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curioslty, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that myftery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubroy for a time lost a sigh of his companion; he left him in daily attendance prior to the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went to the searob of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affectlan; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon help immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadsully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been diseovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originatod in hatred of her character; but lbat he had required, to enhance bis gratification, that his uictim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, throwri even the mask aside\nled to expose the whole deformity of their voices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. Hc resolved to invent some possible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean whilc, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnolced. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarricd female is met with in society; he would lherefore ohliged to carry on his planf in secret; hut Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that ari assignation had been appointed, which would not likely be found in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intention of respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meel her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentioris were such he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he was irritated to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed lour, he ordered a bis servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord. Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interaction.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey did correct his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, the foon found himself in the castle Athens. He they fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon the monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of foreign only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many eloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, lhclt she might have formed the m odel far a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of being fclithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could help those who had no souls. As she danced upon theplain, or tripped along the mountain side, orie would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for wbo would have exchanged her oye, apparently the eye of an animated nalure, for tbot sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompariied Aubrcy in his search after anliquities, and aften would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager goze of him, who forgot the letters he had just dcyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the eontemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, if she flitted around, exhibit in lhe svn's rcly such dclicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the uery object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pclusanias. But why attempt to defcribe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It will innocence, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorjal for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the rnagjc effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of ber native place; she would then describe to hjm the circling dance upon the opon plain, would paint, lo him in all the glowing eolours of youthful memory, thc marriage pop she remembered vicwing in her infancy; and then, turning lo subjects that had evidently Her earnestness andapparent belief of what she narrated, excitcd the lnterest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of thc living vainpyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearft ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of aft ties, forced every year, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearft ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of the nase of old She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by carrying a pretty acovrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, bowever, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the sarne time he wondered at the rnany coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her jnnocence, so contrasled with all the offeoted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his uision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneduated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear bimselsat times from her, and, sorming a plari far some antiquarjan rescarch, who would depart, dotermined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while iri his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconsciaus of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemod to part from him with reluclance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whllst her guardian was occupied in sketehirig or uncovering some fragment which had yet oscaped the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon the doctor, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of these excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once beggod of him not to return at night, as he must neessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever reernain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as imperiding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrcy made light of their representations, and t tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freezc, was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that bis words, moeking the belief of those horrible friends, a child inspired them with such a terror. Whon he wcls about lo depclrt, Ianthe came to the side of his horfe, and earnestly bogged of him to return, where the night ollowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— which promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in the warmer climatcs, sa rapidly gather irito a tromendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He al last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in lhese southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far. The power of the storm was above—lls echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lighting seemed to fall and radiate at hif very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the enchanting forest. The normal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a novel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of decld leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least lrusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunderf, for a moment silent, allowed him to hoar the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the slifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uribroken sound ;— he was startled: but, roused by the thurider which again rolled over his head, be, with a sudden effort, forcod open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; sor, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voiee cried ,\"Again bafsled !\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by orie whose strength seemed superhuman: determiried to sell bis life as dearly as he could, he struggled; bul it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw himself upon bim, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throclt—when the glarc of many torches penetrating through the The storm was still now; and Avbrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their lorches fell upon the mud walls, and the tooth loaded on euery individual ftraw with heavy fl akes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey, they searched for her who had contacted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the angry form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imogination; but he again saw the same forrn, when he unclosed them, stretched by the side. There was no color upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed alinosl as attaching as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and vpon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of the chair who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and furry questions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. Ho knew not what his thoughts wore—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and took refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a parlicular construclion, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different participants who had been engaged in the search of a church whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the city, forewarnod the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. ct :— To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, arid pointed to the curse. They were inconsoloble; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey bcing put to bed wcls seized with a most violent fever, and was often dellrious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and Vpon Ianthe—by some unaccouritable cambination he soemed to beg of his former companion to spare lhe being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate the mcaledictions upon his head, and curse her as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter rocovered from his delirium, he was horrified and slartled at the sight of him whose image he had known combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, impoying almost repentance sor the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the altention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled bim to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no loriger appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soori as his convalescence begon to be rapid, he again gradually retired irito the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived no difference between the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meel his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inaljcious exultation playing upon his lipf: hc knew not why, but this smile haunte During the last slage of the invalid reeovory, Lord Ruthvcn was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised the hy thc cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the noveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wis hed for solitude, his mind would not firid it in the woadf, her light step would appear wandering ainidsl the underwood, in quest of the modcst violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pclle face and wounded throat, with a meek smileupon hor lips. He determined to fly scenes, every face nature of which created such better associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during this illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection would be attached: but though they havetened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest is to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In the consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhobitantf, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a difference. Upon entering, however, a nclrraw defile, at the bottomof which was the bed of a torrcnt, with large masses of rock brought down from the neigbbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent their nogligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were starllod by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, lheir guards had left them, and, plaeing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the lhc report came. Lard Ruthuen and Aubroy, imitating their exomple, rctired for a rnoment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting should be bade in advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the reor, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shal in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the contest or his own circle, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately tbrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring ca bin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—the thing being cont ent merely lo guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days rnortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty stepf. His coriduct and appe arance had not changed; he seemed as uncoriscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, bis mind became apparently uneasy, and bis eye often fixed upon Aubrcy, who was introduced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestries —\"Assist me! you may save rne — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save rny honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but little —my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you could convey all you know of me, my honour was from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death were uriknown sor some time in England nd —I —I —but life .\"— It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultarit violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. ct :\"— His eyes seemed bursting from their socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAu Brey retired to rest, but did not fleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising ear 1 y in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and lnformed him that lt was no longcr there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his reliri ng, to the pirinaclo of a neighbouring inount, according to a p romjse they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, where they had mourited that the summit found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the idenlical rock on which they badly laid the body. For a time, his mind was ewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they could buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such torrible misfortvnes, arid in which all apparently conspired to heighteri that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, be resolved to leave it, and saon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a uessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him believing that Lord Rulhven. Amongst other things, there was a course coordinating several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, whot was his surprise at finding a shealh apparently ornomented in the same style as the dagger discavered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined whon. he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shapod, sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seoined gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular sorm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were also like in splendour on the botb, and left no roam for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Roberts seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey Mirid became almost broken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of urging the speed of the position, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastenod to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the einbraces arid caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine classes, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more athletic as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had only that winning groce which gains the gaze and appearance of the drawing-room semblief. There was none of that light brilliance which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy character about it which did riot seem to arise frommisfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour must attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy, but where her brother broathed to her affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rost, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardianf more fit lhal hor presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the ooritinent, when he might be her protector. It was a riow, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the touch of the beer entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancboly, which overpowered him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, where his mind had been so torn by the ovents he had witnessed; but he determined to socrifiee his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastenod thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilc he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engclged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—hc felt himselfsuddenly seated by the clrm, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin—circumstancos started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his death .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the decld rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be really determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to lack concorning Lord Rutbven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to this assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himsels up to his own devouring thoughts. Percejving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sifter surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he altempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, tumed around, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forw ard, seized his sister's orrn, and, with hurried step, forced hor towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of seruants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper class to hjm —\"Remernber your oath !\"— He did not dare to tvrn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the eertainty of the inonsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it wasin vain that she iritated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon bis breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert his progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicioris, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw the iron one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes treaming with toars, besaught him, for her sake, to supportnoture. At last, no longer capable of bearingstillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to the allexiovs to fly that image which haunted him. This dress became unexpected, and he warned, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no loriger to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sisler, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow them; but they were soon distanced by a hirn who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. ct: Hisconduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to counter again inlo society, and watch him closely, anxious to foreworn, in spite of his oath, all whoin LordRuthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so strikirig, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to begf him to obstain from sce-\nking, for her sake, society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstronce proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume again that t rust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries andsufferings, he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, who engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take correctant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His influence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had atlclined a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of clffection and recolectionremaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then would sometimes start, and, selzing her hands, with looksthal severcly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch hlin. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom referred, this only answer was ,\"True! trvc !\" and again, he sank into a state, whence not even she could raise him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoberences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly collapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to convorse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to work. Glad of this mark of returning the intellectual, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by this oxpressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desire to see his sister. They answered the riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently clgain capable of being clffected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being a mare alive to the foelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was hif surpriso at boholding the features of the monster who was bad so long inflvericed his life. He seized the portra in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under a fool. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her — hen soiziring her bands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the grandparents and physicians, who had heard this whole, and thought this was built a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired back to leave him. How fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to collect the bim, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the moming after the drawing-room, and had been resused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleosureco could hardly be coricealed from thoseamong whom he had given this information. He haslened to the house of his former companion, and, by constarit attendance, and the pretenoe of great affection for the brother and interest in hisfate, he gradually waned the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recounl—could speak of hirnself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, sove with her that whom he addressed himself ;—oould tell how, since he knewher, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it was merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use this serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at l ength to him, he obtained an importarit embassy, which served cls an excuse for hasteriing the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He osk ed for pen clnd paper; it was givon bim; he wrote a letter to his sister, conveying her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who demanded her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. These servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it would be better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a mclnioc. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of a busy preparatian. Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Every grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the seruants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bond was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had some in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not firiding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was a riot mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left the London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardian might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related to what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord. Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACTOF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before home, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbor of Mltylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certainly supply of cattle arid vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smy-\nrncl, itf bounties amply repay for the devi-\nTheation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the hottom of the bay, arid, while the men were employed in watering, and the power bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself looked a ramble to be cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Idaa small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us to come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. ct :\"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said Groek ,\"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I came likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, thc wine-trader, fix hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English overrency ), and has resided there about fourteen moriths, though not constantly; for he said in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis accompanied our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We wore kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting floor, and a b ed-room, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plclin green-stained walls, inarble tables on either fide, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small four-\nntain beneath, which could be made to play through the hranchos by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning picture; a large cushion or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall, I stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bcdchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble reeess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and paperf, which wore them in a large seaman's best in the class: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justisied in examining the courts. On the tablet of the recess lay Vallaire's, Shakspearef, Boileau's, and Rousseau works complote; Volney's Ruinsof Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopftock's Messiah; Kotzebves novels; Sohiller's play of the Robbcrs; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italion editian, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constarit Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scrib bled also over, and marked with flips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old mari said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; for which is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; The be is always very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pcly to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for the whole reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front was sifty paccs long and fourteen broad, and the flutcd marble pillars with black plants and fret-work carnices ,( cls it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkeycarpet, beneath an awning of a strong coarse mine. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the lest harid as wc entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orariges and limes were clustrring together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marblc seat with an ornarnental wooden back was placed, ori which we were told, the lord passedmany of his evenings and nights till lwelve oclock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a birdfly view .\" A line of rich veneyards led a blue eye to Mount Ccllcla, covered with olive and myrtlo trees in blaom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins defceri ded in brokeri coscades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The scale is smooth as glass, and an hour-\nizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnvt and palrn-trees, several small islands were distinct abservod, studding the light blue wave with spolf of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of this person who had resided in this romantic situation: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said over the conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenjan, but on our return to the lown we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was lost upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collecled, to have been a very eccentric and innovative character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage that ought to be proper not to disclose. He held a most beautiful daughter, with whom the Iord was often seen walking on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forle, and taught her half the use of jt.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylone; our imaginations all on the rock, guessing who this rambler like Greece could be. Hc had money, it was a accident: he had a philanthropy of dispositlon, and also those ecccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were displayed.\nct: called. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had neuer then heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pulled into our hands to recognize the rocluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our refearches at the college, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of retuming to Mitylene on some sulure day; but to me that day will never return. I like this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averso toassociating with hurnon nature, or contributing in any way to some its sorrows, or adding to its pleasure. The fact is directly the reverse, the class may be plainly gathered from these little anccdotes. All the fine-sealing\nThe legs of the heart, so olegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, fympathy, and chority appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart religion has set her seal, and over whose head of Berievolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preoeding, pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caulion, particularly when djreeted clgainst rnan's moral inlegrity; andho who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may ce nsure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, arid shun the world applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillot, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "44": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstletion upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Am orig the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Chrislianity; and it has anly assumed its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the lead becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupl if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful storios, still extant, of the deod rising from their groves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variotion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciatod, lost their strength, and spoedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fatt ened—and their skins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies,\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, lhat upon on examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of this place, they positively and unanimously asfirined, that, about five years before, a oertain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been hard to say, lhat, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been torinented by a varnpyre, but had found a way to rid himfelf of evil, by eating some of the earth out of This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent fu further mischjef, the inhabitants having consuated their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to bc usuol in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely sree froin corruption, and emitting clt the mauth, nofeland ears, pure and slorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stack was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried well as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were odopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they fhould, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a perfonsucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems a belter adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a cold sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence,thal the decea-\nsed is not orily doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirie bis infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred arid affection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy oorse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haurit the entire place, And suck the blood of all thy race; Thcre from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the slroarn of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for lheir sire; As But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the hest beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's dream — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek last tinge—her eye last spark, And the last glassy glance must view which sreezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall toar The trosses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn — But now is broken away by the Mcmorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to the sulleri grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more ccursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild hot beautiful poem of \"Thaloba\", the varnpyre corse of the Arabian rnaid Oneiza, who is represented by the gravo for the purpose of tormenting him, she best laved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinsulness of ber life, she being pourlrayed through the whole of the taste as a complete type of purity and irinocence. The veracious Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrisin, to which he pretends to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrative of its effects, has pul sort some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notie es on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the only in most genera 1 acceptance, there are several others synonymous with il, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that ln the inidst of this dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by also quell it, and lhrow fear into those breasts were thoughtless reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain which it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the opposite face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance topierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wishes to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleofed by baving something in their prosenoo capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, eitber from the blush of modesty, or from the slrang ernotiori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win bis atteritions, and galn, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been tho inockery of every monsler shewn in drawing-roorns since her marriage, threw hers But though the common adullrefscould not influerice even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female fex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent cautiori with whom he spoke to the vi rtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wrong tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the race of Aubrey: he waf an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also tohimself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his forlune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of merely subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his argument. He held, hence, that high roinantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruiris so many milliners' apprentices. He believed clll to sympathisc with virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the fence, as we see in Romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consjsted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and uarious coloured patches. He thought, long sine, that the dreams of people were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon bls entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded bim, striving, which should describe with least truth, their languishing or romping fovourites: the daugbters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into false notians of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the roinance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the te tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the present of a ghost, but from the wanl of snvffing, there was no foundation in real lise for the ariy of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed hisstudy. Finding, however, some compensation in this great ied vanity, he was about to reinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary beingwe above described, crossed him in his career.\nHewatched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observalion of exlernal objects, than the taclt assent to their existence, impliod by the avoidance of their contacl: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to oxtravagclnt ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the o Hc became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvenf affairs were embarrassed, arid soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirouf os gaining some information respeeting thjs singular choracter, who, till now, had only whetted hiscurjosity, he hinted to his guardjans, thclt ll was timc for him to perform tbe tour, whicb sor many generatiorishas been thougt neccssary to enable tbe young to lake some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting them lves upon equality with the aged, and not allowing They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark ofesteem from a bim, who, apparently, had riothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Rvthveri's character, and now he faurid, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was profuse in bis liberality ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the heggar, received sromhis hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Bul Aubroy would not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuouf, reduced to indigence by this misfortunes at the endant even upon virtue, that he bestowed hjs alms ;—these were serit from thc door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profigate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow bim to wallow iri his lust, or to sink him sllll deeper in his This was, however, attributed by bim to the greater importuriity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the rotiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. Thero was one circumstance about the charily of his Lordship, which was still more impressive upon his mind: call those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse uponil, because they were all either led to the scafsold, or funk to the lowesl and the most abiecl misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his company sought for the faro table: he hetted, and always gclmbled with success, except where the known sbarper was his antagonist, arid then be lost every more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watebed the society around: it was nol, however, so when he ericountered the rash yov In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he odored, cursing, in the solitude of a durigeon, the fate that had drawn hlm within the reach of this friend; whilst mariy, a father sat frantic, ainidst the speaking looks of into hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of ma ny, the last gilder he had just sncltched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, bowever, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this love hif friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in bis carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater grcltification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaled imagination began to assume the appearance of something superriatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination, thal thero was an evil power resident in his companion, this case seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardiaris insifted upon his immediately Ieaving his friend, arid urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that bis cantempt sor the adultress had not ariginated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratisicatiori, that bis victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinriacle of unsulliod virtue, dowri to the lowest ahyss of infamy and degradation: in f ine, that all those femoles whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandorijrig him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, arid to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, andsoon perceived, that his Lordship was erideavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is a feldom that is uninarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Auhreyf eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an asslgnation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing rio time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intention of respont that lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to inoet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such or he supposed all would have poor such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he was irritated to marry her, mercly laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the romainder of their proposed tour, he ordered a bis servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed ber of allhe knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his opposite assent to a separation; a bull did riot hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHoving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeee, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of o. Greek; arid soon occupied himself in traeiring the faded records of ancient glary upon monumerits that apparently, ashclined of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or mariy colored lichen. Under the sarne roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicote, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing to pray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had nosouls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle was a poor type of her beauties; for who would have changed her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an animical epicure. The light step of Ianthe oftenaccompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquilies, and often would the veneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eoger gazo of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon ari almost an affected tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often wouldher lresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such dolieately hrilliant and swiftly fading hucs, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none means appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished tapreserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and wotch the magic effects of his pericll, in tracing the scenes of her nalive place; she would lhen describe la him the circling dariceupon the open pain, wa uld paint, to him in all the glowing colours of your hful momary, marriage pomp she remembered viewing in bor infancy; and then, turning to subjeets that had Her earriostness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; arid often as she told him the tale of the living vampire, who had passed years amidst his friends, arid dea-\nrest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence sor lhe ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle arid horrible fantasies; hut Ianlhe cited to hirn the names of old men, who had at Iast delected one living ainong themselves, after several of their near rclatives and children had been saund marked with the names of old men, who had at Iast She dotailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still porsisted on persuading hor, that there could be no truth in her fears, though al the sarne lime, he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more love Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found him.\nelf more and more attached to almost a fairy storm before him. He would tearhimself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depclrt, delermined not to return until his object was attained; bvt he always found impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, he retairied ari image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same as an infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had rio longer any one with whom she could visitber favorite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uricovering some fragment which was bad yet eseaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detairi hjm for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return atnight, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, the clock the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres iri their riocturnal orgios, and denounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon hiin, who dored to cross their path. Auhrey made light of lbeir representations, arid tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood frecze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off vpan hjs excursion unattendanced; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking thebelief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depclrt, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and eamestly begged of him to return, ere ni ghl allowed the power of lheso belongings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so involved in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was more of those spokes which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight in this short-\nhern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there will be advanced for, the power of the storm was above—its chasing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through satiguo, stopp ed, and he said, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide them to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dream.\ndful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stlfled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: bvt, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hvt. He found himself in the bitter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of this. He found himself in contaot with some one, whorn he immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\"Agaln basfled!\" to which a loud laugb suoceed; and ho folt hirnself grappled by one which a loud laugb suoceed; and ho folt hirnself grappled by one who was determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was The storm was still now; and Aubrey, capable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the tbatch loadod on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for a ber who had attracted bim by her cries; he was again left ln darkness; but what was his horror, where the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to percelvetbe airy from his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He hurt his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, where he unclosed them, stretched by this side. There was no colour upon her cheek, riot even upon her lip; yet there was a stillriess about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelled there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, orid upon her throat were the mark of leeth hoving aponed the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampyrc !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him, the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been sound in the hut. They were so many different people.\nThe girl who had been engaged in the search of her whom a cell mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were unconscious; they died broken-hearted.\nAuhrey being put to bed was seized with a mosl violent fever, and was often delirious; in those intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by the same unoccountable combination he seemed to beg of his sormer companion tospare the being he loved. At other times, he would interpret maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever move, upon hearing of the state of Aubr ey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyro; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost the appearance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still moro by the attention, anxiety, arid care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. Hls lordshjp seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aurey; but as soon as his convacesenoe began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Auhrey perccived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intentlyupon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this film haunted him During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watehing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, jn rnarking the progress of those orbs,circling, like your world, the moveless svn ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's inirid, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which bad once so distinguished bim now seemed to have fled for ever. He was riow as much a lover of slitvde and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much cls he wished for solitude, his mind could not find il in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he bad formerly frequented, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he sought il in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; lhen suddenly turriing around He determined to fly the scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greeee neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and soughl every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus havetened from place to place, yel they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of in individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they drew from prelended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, ori orie occasion, they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon enlering, howevor, a narrow desile, at tbc boltom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from theneigbbouring practices, they bad reason to repent lheir negligenee; for scarcelywere the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were slartled by the whist ling of bvllets olose to their heads, clnd by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behirid rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering lurri of tbe dcfile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, is one of the robbers should climb above and lake them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lard Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastencd to his assistance; clnd, no longer heeding the eontest or hif 0 wn peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him — his guards having, upan Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Auhrey soon induced the tbern to convey his wounded sriend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransorn, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should retum with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strengthropidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his inind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Auhrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\" I need but a little — my life ebbs place — I cannot explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of me, iny honour were free from stain in the world's mouth — and my death was unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raifiring himself with exvltant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to only living in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed hurt from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrcy; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending a high acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his death, a cold shivering came over him, as is from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting a bim. Rjsing early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a rohber met him, and iriformed him that it was no longer tbere, having beeri conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cald ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey aslonished, and taking several of the meri, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the course or the clothes, although the robbers swore, they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but hc at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse sor the store of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all happened to heighten that superstitious melancholy thal had seized upori his mind, who resolved to leave, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupied by arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongft other things, there was a case containing sevoral weapons of offence, more or less a date to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious for ms, what was a bis surprise at finding a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may he imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, lhesheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed to be bourid to the dagger; yet still wished to disbelieve; but the partjcular form, the samo varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendor on both land and leftno roam sor doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seductivo arts. Her parents were in a diftress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became more and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postings, as if we were going to save the life of someone beheld dear. He arrived at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed abedient to his will, soon wafted birn to the English sbores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, arid there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, why her infantine earesses had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more athletic as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the gaze arid applause of the drawing-room assernaries. There was none of that light brilljanoy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was light lit up by the quality of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy eharm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was neuer brightened by the smell of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forgel those griefs, she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile sor that of the voluntary? It seemed as if those eyes — that space was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was having been thought by her guardians more fit that her prosecution should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epooh of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rathor have remained in the mansion of his fathers, arid fed up on the melancholy which overpowered him. Ho could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by theevents he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his awn comfart to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask on the smile of the royality, haslened thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engclged in tbc remembrancethal the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that very place — he felt himself suddenly seized by the room, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your cllb .\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a speclro that would blast him, when he pereeived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He played the room with hurried steps, and fixed his bands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him—circumstances started up in a dreodful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resling upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the riarne hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and he gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many werc loaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnct conversation; be attempled to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features which most clbhorrod. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurriod step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the erowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing lhem, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distrocted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now checked, arid it was in vain that she wanted him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and thus terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started him ;— Was he then to allow this monster to ro am, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very first might have been touched by them. But even if he were to break his path, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to force the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and also only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought a horn, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became unexpected, and was wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to this midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow them; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from though. His conduct, however, study.\nThe deny changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absencc the whole of his friends, with a friend amongsl thom, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his death, all whom Lord Ruthven appeared with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward sbudderings was visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of hiding to abst again from seeking, for her fake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, remonstrclncc proved unoualing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injurief and sufforings had dally encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the global eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take correctant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His influence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. Therefore, he would often lie for doys, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attached a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of afseclion and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflictod her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him — if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he answered, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again he sarik into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his iricoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a porlion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definitive number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wheri, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physicicln upon the mclancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in so owful a situation, when his fister was going next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been depriued, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still made by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptjals, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely srnile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's boing once more alive to the feelings of of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and tocongratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceivod a local upan her breast; opening it, wbal was his furprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He asked the portrait in a process of rogo, and trampled it under a fool. Upon her asking him why he has destroyed the resemblance of ber future husband, he loakedas if he did not understand ber—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swcar that she would never wed this monstor, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade him rernember his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruth In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay the hut for one day. They, attributing this to the insariity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the draw ing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill heolth, he readjly understood himsels to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could bardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constarit attendanoe, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue, child dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowdedearth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to hersoothing. accents ;— in fine, he knew so well how to use these serpents art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affection.\nthe news. The title of the elder branch falling clt length to him, he obtained an important embasfy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place like every day before his departure for this cannot.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to give the seruants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he announced the most heavy curfes. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, be thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, this ravings of a maniac. Night passed without a rest to the busy immediately of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Mornirig came, and the sourid of carriages broke upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of their hippolessold woman. He f cized the opportunity, with one hound was out of the back room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assombed. Lord Ruthven was the sirst to proceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurried bim from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\" Remember your goal, and know, is not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonovred. Women are frail !\" So saying, he provided him towards his attendarits, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage riot finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he enlored, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Misf Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubre-\nmy sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, whore to choose his place of real, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, a board orie of his Majesty vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The health of this place, and the certain fupply ofcattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—bolh meri of warand merchantmeri; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed also usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the relatives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the grow of Mount Ida (a small montice so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days upon us to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged much as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I was likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dorninick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about Lz 50 English curreney ,) and has rcsided there about fourteeri months, though not constantly; for be sails in his felucca very often to the difsererit islands .\"\nThis account exciled over curiosity very much, and we lost no time, Iri has been listening to thebouso where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the grourid-floor — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parour, and a bed-room, with a spocious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: plairi green-stained wallf, marble tables on the other side, a large myrtlo in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a learning posturo; a large cauch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there weren't mirrors, nor a single point. The bedchamberhad mercly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts arid a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we ohsorvod a marble recoss, farmerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papers, which were tbon in a large seaman chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exomining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Bileau's, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermori, in the German language; Klopstack Messlah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, pririted at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from thc Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of anydescription. Most of these books were filled with marital noodles, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, which also were remarks.\nTho old man said :\"Tbe lord had been reading these books the evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bul,\" said he ,\"there they must live until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, hc would frown upor me for a week together; hc is otherwise very good. I did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The p ortico in frant was fifty paces looking and fourteeri broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fretwork cornices ,( as it is now oustomary in Greciari architecture ,) were considerably higher than the raof. The roof, surrounded by a light stane balustrade, was covered by a sine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning or slrong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops aro thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", elling fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away,grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, clnd under the shade of twa large myrlle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelvo clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\"arid always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be called \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with olive and myrlle trees in bloom, arid from the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascodes, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, termlriates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a visla of lofly chesnut and palm-trees, sevoral small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solution: none knew his name but Dominick, his bariker, who had gone to Canada. \"Tho Armeniari\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell an old friend?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said hc ,\"I dare not\". We do not have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had pronounced eight young girls when he was last upon the jsland, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, Borsos to other men, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own in a gale, and often gave G reek Teslaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we called, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the contact thought proper not to disclose. He was a bad, the most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of just.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful islo of Mitylene; our imaginations all from the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecc entricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were displayed. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom yav are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of his lordship fame, or what had been the same years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of CalcIa on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we corisoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse also associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to solve its sorrows, or add that its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may he plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so clearly depicted in his lordships, seeing to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being an whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head, Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lraits\" without feeling proud of him called a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are even to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; arid he would dclres justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may ensure the errors of cl fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applausc, is the surest testimity of a virluous heart and self-approving consequence.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "45": "THE VAMPYRE;\nA call.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be eommori: it did not, howcver, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Cbristianity; and it has only saved its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea of becoming prevalenl, that a Lat in the body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young In the West it spread, with some slight variation, also over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whero belief existed, thol vampyres nightly imbibed a cortain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattoned—and their veins became distendcd to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies\nIn the London Journal, of March ,732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is started to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, thal upan an examination of the commander-in-chief and masters of the place, they positively arid unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Hey-\nduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to soy, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Tv rkifh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating sorne of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precautlon, however, did not prevent a hlrn from becoming a varnpyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent furthermischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (asis supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emilting at the mauth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus oblained, they resorted to the acousted remedy. Astake was driven eritirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and t hurried the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously dled from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nThe Chief Baiiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is a herc created, because it seems better adap ted to illustrate the subject of the presenter observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of puriishment after death, for some heirious crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his irisernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and offection .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from ils tomb be rent; Then ghastly about the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from lhy daughter, sister, wife, Al midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathethe banquet which perforce Must feed tby livid living corse, Thy vlctims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sirc; As cursing  But one that for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a falher's name — That word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheeks lasl tingc—her eye's lclst spark, And the laft glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Thcn with unhallowed hand shall tear The lresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in life, a lock wheri shorn Affections foridest pledge waf worn—But now is borne away by the Momorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drop; Thy gnasbing looth, and haggard lip; Then stalking lo thy sullcn grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these iri horror shrink away from spectre more aecursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in bis wild but beauliful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneizcl, wbo is represented as a hauing relurned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him which best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenee. This ueracious Tovrnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides the cl variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbariari error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singlely horrible superstilion might be cldded; though the present may suffice for the limits of cl note, neoessarily devoted to explanalion, and which may now be concluded by merely remclrking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in rnast general acceptance, there are several other synonymous with it, madc use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul,\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon this march around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw feor into those breasts where thoughtlessness relgned. Those who selt this senscltion of awe, cauld not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object face, did not seem to penetrate, arid at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upori the cheek with a leaden ray that weigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him. lo he invited to every house, wished to seehim, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hcve of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, eilber from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passlon, though its forrn and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attenlions, and gain, at least, soine marks of whclt they might term afetion: Lady Mercer, who had been lhe mockery of euery monster shewn iri drawing-rooms since her in Bvt though tbe common adultress cauld not inflvence even tbe evidence of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet sucb was the apparent cavtlon with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He hcld, however, the reputation of winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young geritleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hone, that high romantic feeling of honaur and candour, which daily runs so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathize with virtue, and thaught that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictures of the scene, as we see inromances: be thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted of iri the uesting of olothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eyo by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realilies of life. He was handsome, frank, and ricb: for these reasons, upon his eritering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth, their languishling or romping favourites: the daughters clt the same lime, by their brighlening countenances when he approached, found by their sporkling eyes, when they opened his lips, soon led bim into false notlons of his talents and his meril. Attaohed af he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except ln the tallow and wax candles that flickered, riot from the presence of a ghost, but from the wanl of snuffing, there was no fouridation in real life for any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those voluines, froin which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of hif observation of external objects, thari the tacit concept to their existence, im plied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture evory thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of cl romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Stevens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the note of preparation in — Slr-\nWell, that he was about to travel. Desirous of galning some inforination respecting this singular character, who, lill now, had only whettod his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, whichfor many generations has been thought necessary to be able the young to take some rapid steps in the care of the vice towards putting themselves vpori an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to ap peclr as if fallen from the skies, whenever scaridalous intrigues are mentioned They oonsented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from Hiin, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in the cold a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord R through the character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions wereexposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality ;— which idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, thal lt was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigonce by the misfortvnes atteridant even upan virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed fneers; but when the profligclte came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow bim to wallow in his lust, or to sink him stilldoeper in his iniquity This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the victory, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was a true circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was heftowed, inevitably sound that there was a curse upon it, for those were all either Ied to the scasfold, or sunk to the lawest and the most ambitious misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fasbionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gained success, except where the known sharper was his antagoriist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which his companion sought for the centres of the faro table: he betted, In every town, he left the formerly afflu-\nent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the soIitude of a dungeon, the fate that haddrawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst mony o father sot frantic, amidst being speaking looks of mute hungry children, without cl single farthing of his late immense wealth, wberewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yot he took no money from the gambling table; hut immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last gilder he bad just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was nol, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wishes to represent this to his friend, and help him to resign that charity arid pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in hif carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenef of nalure, was always the same: bis eye spoke less than his ljp; and though Avbrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it that the constant excitement of vainly wishing to hear that mystery, which this actual imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon clrrived at Rome, and Aubrey sor a time lost sight of his companiori; he left bim in daily atlendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in fearch of the memorlols of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which happened with eager impatience; the sirst was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aslonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the beli-\nef .. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving a brief friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for thattbe a passession of irresistible powers of education, rendered his Incentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his coritempt for the adultress had riot origiriated in hatred of her character; but that he had rcquired, to enhance his gratification, that bls viotirn, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest ab yss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all thase females whom be had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure,\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, arid soon peroeived, that his Lordship was endeovouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chicfly requested. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarriod female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windingf, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would mast likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly askedhim his inlentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the sarne time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answer-\nre d, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must docline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The examination was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify hif complete assent to a separation; bvt did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Avbreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing Spain, soon found himself at Athens. Ho then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traoing thefaded records ofancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, child hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured llchen.

As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the inountain side, one would have thought that gazelle a poor type of hor beavties; for whom would have exohanged her eye, apparently the eye of an animated riature, sor that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure.

Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray so delicately. brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might excuse the forgetfulness of the anliquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pavsanias. But why attempt to doscribe charms which all feel, but rione can appreciate ?— It was innoeence, youth, cold beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-\nng-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remnants of whlcb he wished to preserve amemorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the sce nco upon the apen plain, would paint, to him in oll the glowing colovrs of youthful memory, the mclrriage pomp sbe remembered viewing in her infaricy; and then, tvrning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excjted lhe interest even of Aubrey; ond often as sbe told him the tale of the living vampyre, wha had passed years amidst his friendf, and dearsl ties, foroed every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong bis existence for tbe ensuing rnonths, his blood would runcold, whj1st heattempted to laugh her out of such id She detailed him the traditional appearance of these moristers, and his horrar was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthuen; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in herfears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all terided to excito a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so conlrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman among whom he had sought for his visian romance, won his beort; and while he described the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he sound himself more and more attached to the a lmost foiry forin before hiin. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his atterition upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconfcious of his love, and was ever sarne frank infantile when he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctanee; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favorite clothes, while her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet eseaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of companies, and they both, with a several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey deteriniried to proceed upon the orie of his calculations, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged after him not to return at night, as he must necossarily pass through a wood, where no Greek wouldever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in theirnocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Auhrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at this daring thus to make a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was fluent.\nNext, moming Aubrey set off upon a hif excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnesly begged of him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted bis horse, deterrnined to make up by speed for his delay: hut it was too late. Twilight, in these southern olimales, is alrnoft unknown; immediately the sun sets, night bogins: and there he had advariced far, the power of the storm was clbove—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forcedils way through the canopyling foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and which was carried with a dreadful ropidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was in the neighborhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead loaves arid brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain a sheller from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, sor a moment silent, allowed hiin to hear the dreadful shrieks of a wornan mingling with the stifled, exultant mookery of a Iaugh, conlinued in one almost unbrokeri sound ;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, gulded him. He was apparently unperccived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of them. He found himself in contact with someone, whom immediately seized; when a voice cried ,\" Again haffled !\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled with an enormous force against the ground :—his energy threw himself upan bim, and kneeling upon bis breast, had placed his hands upon his throat — when the glare af inany torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in that day, disturbed him ;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, arid in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torohes fell upon the mud walls, and the lhe thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flaks of soft. At the deslre of Avbrey they searohod for her wbo had altraoted him by her cries; he was again left iri darkness; bvt what was his horror, when tho light of thc torches once more bursl upan him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was built a vision arising from hisdisturbed imagination; but he again saw the sarne form, when he closed them, stretched their side. There was no colour upon beer oheek, not an oven upon her lip; yet there was a stillness aboulher face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that orice dwelt there :— upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire!  a vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, arid Aubrey was loid by the side of a ber who had already been to him, the treatment of so many bright and fairy visions, a riow fallen with the flower oflife that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were—bis mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take a refvge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a partioular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, sorewarnod the party.\nThe contents of some dreckful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, arid pointed to the worse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often dolirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some vigouritable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as a beer destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Alhens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, arid became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the si ght of bim whose image he had riow combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, implying almost repentanco for the foult that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which hc showed, saon reconciled him to his presence. Hjs lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonjshed Aubrey; bvt as soon as his convalefcericc began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perccived no difference from the former inan, except that al tirnes who was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upan him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, bvt this During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, tho moveless sun ;— Indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, is much weakened, and that elastioity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for soIitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst lhe ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthes form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bilter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, who he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither hadyet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from the place to place, yet they seemed not to beed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, or on occasion they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a riarrow desile, at the bottom of which was thebed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they had a reason to repent their negligence; sor scarccly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant, their guards had left them, arid, placing themselves behirid rockf, had begun to fire iri the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitalizing their exomple, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but as hamcd of being thus detained hy a foe, who with lnsutting shouts bade them advarice, and being expased to uriressing slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once torusb forward in search of the eryery. Hardly bad thoy lost the shelter of the roek, when Lord Ruthven received a shot on the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, the upan Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubreysoon induced them to convey a wounded friend to a rightbovring cabjn; orid having agreed upon a ransorn, he was no more disturbed by their prefence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two daysmortification ensued, and death served aduancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had riot changed; he feemed as unconscious of pain as he had been af the object about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye oft en fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his conscience with mare thon usual eamestenfs —\"Assist me! you may have me—you may do more than that — I mean only my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honor. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannol explain the whole — but if you conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some lime in England —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying inan, raising himsels with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for cl yecl and a day yau will not impart knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and he hatched no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over high, as if from the prefentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself andcomrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first oold roy of the inoon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and toking several of the meri, determined to go and bury it on the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the sulmlt, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the idenlical rock on which they had lald the body. For a time, his mind was bewjldered in conjeclers, but he lost last returned, convinced that they had brought the phrase for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had inel with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melaricholy lbat had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthen. Amongst other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offeri-\nnice, more orless adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several challenges and advantages. Whilst turning them over, and exomining their curlovs forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered.\nered that it filted, though precisely shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty — they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet flill he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheatb were alike in splondour on both h, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rom e, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens seduclive arts. Her parents were a long distress, their fortune turned, and she had not been heard of since the deporture of bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the anthe. He became morosearid filont; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, cls if he were going to saue the place of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calaif; a breeze, which soemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to be English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attoching as a company.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning the circle which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room samples. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a m elancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling withiri, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighler rcalm. Her step was not thal light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a color may attract — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her focus was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, arid would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptary? It seemed as if those eyes — that face were then playing in the light of their own universe. Shc was yet only eighlecn, and had not been presented to the world, it had been thought by ber guardions more fit than her presentation fhould bedelayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might becctor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, could be the epoch of her eritryinto to be a \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his falhers, and fed upon the melaricholy which overpowered the bim. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torri by the events he had wishes; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been clonounced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and also was anxious to bask in the smile of royclly, hastened thither. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around bjm, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvenwos in that very place — he felt himself sudderilyseized by the arm, and a voice which recognized too well,founded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he performed, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his life almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the erowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the roar with hurried stops, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances slarted up in dreadful arrcly—the dagger—his oat h .— He roused hiinself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had injured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could he really — which determined, therefore, to go against inla fociety; for though he ottempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upan his lips, and he could not succeed in gclining insormation. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Preceiving, at last, that many wero leaving, he roused himself, and ontering another room, found a hif sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnesl conversation; hc attempted to pass and get near her, whori one, whom he requested to move, turned rourid, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, clnd, witb hurried stcp, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himsels impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while hc was engaged in passing them, he again heard that the voice whisper close to him —\"Romember your oath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distraeled. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was just engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again pressed upon bis thoughts. His slstersattenlions were now unheeded, and it was in vairi that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered sew words, and those terrified her. The more much thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started hlm ;— Was he able to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his shortcomings, who would believe in the third? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For the day he remained in this state; shut up in his room, be saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, witheyes strcaming with tears, besought bim, for her sake, to support nature. Al l ast, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left the house, roamed from the street to the street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the thenoon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; it first returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whatever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow a bim; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any —f-\nfrom the thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of the hif oatb, all whom Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, but inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved uriailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before irnposed upon them by Aubreys par ents.\nDesirous of saving him from the irijurics and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physicianto r esido in the house, and take constant color of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became in the last so great, that he was considered to hold a chamber. There he would often lie for days, the inoapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of afsoction and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then would sometirnes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch the bim. \"Oh, do riot touch the bim—if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she arrived at whom he referred, if the only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he sank into a state, when she could not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind thrcw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definitive number, and then smile.\nThe time held nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to eonverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbreys being in such an awful situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey attentian was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they fear, and he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seomed plcased, and astonished them still more by bis expressing his intention to be present at the nupticlls, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of a very lovely smile; for he pressed her to hif breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wanted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when suddenly perceived a locket upon her break; opening it, whal washis surprise at bebolding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did riot understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bode her swear that she would never wed this monstcr, for he — But he could not advance —il seemed as if that voice again made him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rulhven was near him but saw In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who should hear the whole, and though this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knowledge to them, he implored, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, considered to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven held the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former campaign, and, by constant attendance, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his player? His tongue had dangers and tools to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he added himself;—could tell how, since he kriew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to hor soothing accents ;— fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's clrt, or such was the will of fale, that he gained her affection The title of the elder branch folling at Iength tohim, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the content.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued ber awn happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once beld her in their arms as t her back and the hope of their house, to delay but sor a few hours that marriage, on which he denaunced the most heovy curscs. Theservants prornised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Mifs Aubrey, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may be more careful than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning come, and the sound of carriages broke the upper high ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at least overcome their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He realized the opportunity, with once bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, talking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his oar —\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, yourfisler is dishonoured. Wamen are frail !\" So saying, pushed him towards his attendants, a woman, rushed by the old woman, had come in the scorch of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, but was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was soleinriized, and the bride and bride left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the esfusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He described his sister guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour hadflruck, he related to what the reader had perused — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians based on protecting Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of these Maiesly vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce rnany British vessels to visit it—both men of war arid merchantmen; and though it is rather out of the track sor shops bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviatiori of a voyago. We landod; os usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and tbe purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a rainble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain sa named) we met with a cland engoged to young Greck as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me of a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quitMitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, a winc-trader, six bundred zechincs for it ,( about L 250 British currency ,) and he resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he failed in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had decided. We wore kiridly received by an old man who coriducted us over the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground-floor — an entrance ball, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet announced. They were also simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle iri centre, and a small fountain beneoth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a lorge couch or sofcl completed the furniture. In the half, a half-a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pointing. The bedcbamber had a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the siltirig-room we observed a marble recess, sormorly, the old mon told us, filled with books and papers, which were lhen in a large seaman's chesl in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Rousseau works complete; Volney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstook Messlah; Kotzebues novels; Schillers play of the Robbers; Miltons Paradise Lost, an Italian edilion, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, muoh torn, but no Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with the flips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\" Therefore they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is always very good. I once did him a service; and I had the product of this farm for the trouble of toking care of it, except twenty zechines which I paid to an aged Armenlan who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nct: The appearance of the house is extremely pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and often broad, and the fluted marblc pilars with black plinths and frct-work cornices ,( as it is now cuslornary in Grecian architecturo ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christle\", eating fruit, arid enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, if we eritered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were custering together on its borders, arid under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a rnarble seat with an omamental wooden back was planted, on which we were told, the lord possed many of his evenings and nighls till twelve o'clock, reoding, writing, and talking to bimsolf \"I suppose,\" said to be an ald man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout,\" and always atterided our chureh twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calca, covered with olive and myrlle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic days. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sca smootb as glass, and ari horizon unshadowed hy o fingle cloud, lermincltes the view in sront; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald greeri. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our cnquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had residod in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to California. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And cannot you tell, old friend ?\" said I ,\"If I can\" said he ,\"I dare not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the public feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and a cotton and slack to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a sisterman who had lost his own in a college, and he often gave Greek Testamen ts to the poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and beneficial character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her a bit of the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was evident: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geriius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falliring in company with Mr. FOSTER, the artist, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeee ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whoin you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedof, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never then heard of bis lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; bul \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the relief of Calcla on the evory page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious iri our research at the cottage, but weconsoded ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene ori some future day; bvt to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believe it is not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as a cln unfeeling disposition, have used to associating with human nature, or conlributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little aneodotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his bed. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to follow all his actions: and bis courting the repose of society is an additional reason for making a hjm as a being an whose heart religion hatb set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hatb thrown her mantle. Noman can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are never to be received with caution, particularly where directed against man moral integrity; arid he who doesres justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest telimony of a virluous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "46": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded just very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeksuntil after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present formsinco thedivision of Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, jl gradually increased, clrid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extanl, af the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and death f In the West it spread, with the same slight variation, allover Hungary, Poland, Austrio, and Lorraine, where the belies existed, thal vampyres nigblly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, losl thoir strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattene d—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of\nIn the London Journal, of March ,1732, is o curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular course of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in March, in Hungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-ln-chies ondinagistrates of the place, lbey positive and unanimously affirmed that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been beard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyres grave, and This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death arid burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was inade, that four people had been deprived of life by his altacks. To prevent the surther mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as just supposed to be visual in oases of vampyrism) fresh, and enlirely free from corruption, and nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having a beer this obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and badly of Arriold Paul, at which he is reported to have crled over as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the case into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief ls, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turri.\nThe brief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for somo hejnous crimc committedwhilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compared to canfine his infernal visits solely to those being gs he loved moft while upon earth—tobose to whom he was bound by lies of kindred and affection .— A supposilion alluded to in the \"Giaou r\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse fhall from its tomb bo rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all by race; There from thy daughter, sister, wise, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corfe, Thy victims, where they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing them, thou cursing them, the flowors are wjthered on the slem. But the order that far the crime must fall, the youngest, besl beloved of all, Shall bless thec with a father's name — The word shall wrap the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the lasl glassy glance must uiew which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with a nhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of ber yellow hair. Of which, iri Ilfe a lock when sharn Affections fondesl pledge was worn — But now is horne away by the Memorialof thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood fhall drip; Thy griashing tooth, arid haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in the horror shririk away fromspectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampire corse of the Arclbian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being poured throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long accourit in his lravols of several astoriishiring cases of vampyrisrn, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotef, and lradiationary narratives illustrat-\nThe view of its effects, has put forth some leamed disasters, trying to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany eurious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanatiori, and which may now be concluded by mercly remclrking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Gou1, Broucoloka, &c.\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the ruins of the diaries attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the loaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirror around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the sair only attracted his attention, that he might be by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, sixing upon the object space, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had become accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of the enn ui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the lhedly hue of his faco, which riever gairied a warmer tint, either from the blvsh os modesty, or from the slrong emotion of passion, trought form and outline were beautiful, mclny of tho female hunters after notoriety attempted to wiri his cltlentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercor, who hod been the mockery of tho female hunters But though the oornmon adultress could not influence eventhe guidclnco of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he had addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were inoved by his apparent hatred of love, he was af often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the samo time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey:he was cln orphari left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himsels by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished to make an important charge of his mind to the core of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more bis imagination than hif judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathife with virtue, arid thought that the vice was thrown in by Pravidenee merely for the picturesque effeel of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting ofclothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the patients' eye by their irregular solds and various colourod patches. He thought, infine, that the dreams of photos were the realities of life. He wcls handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, inany mothers svrovrided him, striving which should describe with loast truth, their Ianguishing or romping favourites: the daughters of the same time, by their brlghtening countenclnces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he operied his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as be was to the romarice of his solitary hours, he started at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real. life, so any of those congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, bowever, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dream, where the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man enlirely absorhed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of external objeels, than the lacil assent to their existence: allowing his imagination on to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object irito the hero of a romanee, and determined to observe the offfpring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that this presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informalion rospeeting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinled to his guclrdians, that il was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations had been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards pvtting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if failen from the skies, whoneuer scandalous intrigues aro r They consentedly and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flatterod by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other rnen, he gladly accepted it, and iri a few days after they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Au brey hod bad no opportunity to study Lord Rvthvens character, and now he fourid, lhat, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the opposite motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberity ;—theidle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced toindigence of the misfortvnes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms ;—these were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in bis lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chemistry. This was, however, attributed him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumftarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still rnore improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, irievitobly found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest arid the most awful misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with wbich his companion sougbt for the centres of al 1 fashionable vlce; there he entered intoall the spirit of the foro table: he botled, and always gambled with suooess, except where lhe known sharper was his antagonlst, and then he lost even rnore than he gained; but it was alwayf with the same unchanging fae In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circlehe adorned, cursing, in tbo solitudo of dungeon, the fate thathad drawn him within the reach of this ficand; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the spcaking laoks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of hjs a lot of immense wealth, wherewith to buy cuen sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling lable; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last girl he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey oftenwished to represent this to hif friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did riot tend to hisown profit ;— but he delayed it — for each day hc hopod his friend would give bim some opportunity to speak frankly and apparently to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthvon in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich fences of nature, was always the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratisication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exaggerated imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily interval upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost dese-\nThe first city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eagor impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give them sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisled upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that possession of irrecistible powers of feduction, rendered his liceritious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovored, that hjs contempt for the adultross had not originated in hatred of her character; but that hc had required, to enharice his gralifieation, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled srom the pinnclcle of unsullied virtuc, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females wham he had sought, apparently on account of\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose ch character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning hiin altogether, purposing,in the mean wise, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon pe received that his Lordship was undeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plons in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appoinled, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartinent of Lord Ruthven, and abruply asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing a bim at the same time that he was aware of his beingabot to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such cls he supposed all would have been such cln occasion; and upon being pressed whether both intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a nole, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, nol only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordfhip. The assigriation was prevented. Lord Rulhven noxt day merely sent his secret to notify his complete asserit to a sepclration; bvt did riot hlnt any suspension of his plans having been foiled by Aubreyf interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed these steps toward Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Thehenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupjed himself in tracing the faded records of anoient glory upon monumerits tbatapparently, clshamed of chronicling the deeds of freomen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sbeltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wisbing to pourtray ori oanvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomets paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle of poor lype of her bcauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animclted nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ian the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconsciovs girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttorfly, showed the whole beauty of her form, floating as it was upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgat the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, or she slitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might woll excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who Iet escape from his mind, the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. Bul why attempt to describeeharms which all feel, but nono can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and heauty, unaffecled by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. While he drew those remains of which he wished topreserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magio effects of hif penoil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, la him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing ln her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently mode a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited about the interest oven of Aubrey; and often as fhe told him the tale of lhe living uampyre, who had passed yoars amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for tbe ensuing months, his blood would rvn eld,whilst he attempted to laugh her out of a sl amp of the She detailed to bim the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by bearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; how, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there would be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many eoincidences which had all turned to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthueri.\nAubrey began to attract himself more arid more to Ianthe; her innooence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English babits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before hiin. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix bis attention upon the ruins around him, but he always found an image that seemed olono the rightfulpossessor of bis thoughts. The anthe was conscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her f avourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She hadappealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, afraid they both, with several present,affirmed their existence, called with horror at the very name. Soon clster, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excvrslons, which was to detclin him for a few hours; when they heard the naine of the place, they all at once begged of bim nol to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remclin, after the day had closed, upon ariy consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced that most he vy evils of impending upon him who dared to cross theirpath. Aubrey madc lighl of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring, thus to mock a superinsernal power, the very name of which apparently made their hlood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the renelancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. Whenhc was about to depart, Ianthe came to the sido of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, there might allow the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. Ho was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the borizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so ropidly gathorinto a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determinod to make up by speed for his delay: but it was taolate. Twilight, in these southern cultures, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and he hcld aduanced far, the power of the storm was above—its ecboing thvnders had scarcely an interval of rest—ils thick heavy rain forced its way through the eanopying foliage,whilst the blue forked lightning soemed to fall and radiate at hif vcryfeet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he wascarried with a dreadsul rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, hy the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovol that hardlylifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushw-\nThe food which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the tawn, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exullant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound ;—he was startled: bul, roused by the thunderwbich again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Ho was apparently unporcelved; for, though hc called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found bimself in contact with some one, whom was immediately seized; when a uoioe cried ,\"Again baffledged!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seomed superhuman: determined to sell his lifo as dcarly as he eould, he struggled; but it was in valnhe was left from his feel and hurlcd with enormovs force against the ground :—his enemy  The storm was still now; and Aubrey, the iricapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the desire of Auhrey they searched for her who had attracted bim by ber cries; he waf again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchef once made burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colover upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemod almost as attaching as teelt there :—upon her neck clnd breost was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teelh having opened the vein :— to this the men ppointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A little was quickly formod, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had latoly heen to him that object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fell clean with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refugo in vacanoy — he held almost exclusively in his hand, a naked dagger of a partlcular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different participants who had been engaged in the search of a mother who had missed. Their lamentahle cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of the stone dreadful catastrophe. —Ta describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-heartedly.\nAubreybeing put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he feemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecale malodictionsupon his head, and curse him as her sister. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, srom whatever motive, upon hearing of the structure of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his accountant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Rulbven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, consciousness, and more w which showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that an apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as bis convalescence began to be rclpid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference. from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed interitly upon him, with a smile of maliciovsexullation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile had unted him. During the last floge of the riverllid recovery, Lord Rvthven was apparently engaged in wotching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of tbose orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of salitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbov rhood of Athens; if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear waridering amidst the underwood, in q uesl of lho modest violel; then suddenly turniriground, would show, to his wild irnagination, her pale face cland wounded He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associatians in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthventa whom he held himself bound by the terider care he had been taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece, which had yet been seen. They trauelled in every diroclion, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: bvl though they cleaned from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of the individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they drew from pretending dangers. In consequence, of thus being collecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve class guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow dofile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from neighbouring precipices, they hod the reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were started by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of sev-\nreal guns. In an instant, their guards left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, iinitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering lurn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shovts badethem advance, and being exposed to urireslsting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they delermined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the boulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, na longcr heeding the contest or his own pcril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthveris being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and baving agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence — they were conterit merely toward the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength rapidly decreased; in two days the morlisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubroy, who would be induced to offcr his absence with more than usual eornestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may do more than that — I mean that my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I needed but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if my death was unknown when for some time in England —I — I —bul lise. \"—\"It shall not be a friend. \"—\"Swcar !\" cried the dying man, raising himsels with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul revores, by all your nature fears, swear thal, sor a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever rainy happeri, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\"I swer !\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retlred to rest, but did not sleep; then many circumstances altending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew nol why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivering came over bim, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting bim. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the house in which he had left the corpse, when a robber methim, and informed him that it was no loriger there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retriaring, to the pinriacle of a neighbourling mount, according to a promise they had givenhis lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the inoan that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he was held mounted to the suminit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpsc for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apparently conspired to heigblen that superstitious melancholy thal had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Napl es, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him bringing to Lord Rulhven. Amongft other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagharis. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forins, what was his surprise at finding o sheath apparently ornamerited in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and bis horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, theshoalh he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—thcy seemed going to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbeljeve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubl; there were also drops of blaod on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and took his way home, in Rome, his first inquiries were concerned in the lody he had attempted to snatch from Lard Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iant ho. He became morose and silent; and his only oocupation consisted in urging the speed of the postjlions, if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breoze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted hiin to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and earcsses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more athletic as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of such drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancboly charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunc, but from the soine feeling withln, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strayswhereer a butterfly or a colour moyattract — was sedate and pensive. When alone, her space was never brightened by the smile of joylbut when her brother breclthed to her affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have an exchongedher smile for that of the uoluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— that faoe were their playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardians more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epooh of her entry into the \"busy scene. \"Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feelinterest about the facilities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and also who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened either. ct: Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heodless of all around him, changed in the remembrance that the first lime he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—be felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly cared to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blame him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his uncle to this spot upon his first entry into society.\nthe text. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight.\nthat, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid, his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Revited again before him—circumstances started up in a dreadful array—the dagger—his oath .— He roused himself, he would riot belleve it possible—the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination bad conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real — he determined, therefore, to go again intosaciety; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in admiring information. He went a few nights after the wife's sister to the classembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a process, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, thatmany were leaving, he refused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and replied to him those features he made abharred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, sorced her towards the fire-\net: al the door he found bimself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wailing for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he clgairi heard that voioe whisper close to him —\"Remember your aath !\"— He did not dare to turn, but, burrying bis sister, soon reached home.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monsters living again presfed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now unheeded, and it was in vaintbat she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt product. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His path started him ;—was he able to allow this monster to roam, bearing a rule upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not averl its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he reinained in this state; shut up in this room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister carne, who, with eyos streaming with tears, besoughthim, for her fake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-doy svn as to the inidnight darnp s. He was no longer to be recognized; at first, he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherevor fatigue overtook him. Hjs sister, anxious for his safety, omployed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by a hlm who fled from a pursuer swelfter than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absenee the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, arixious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intjacy. But when he enlered into a room, hjs hclggclrd and suspicious looks were so strjking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to ahstain from sceking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance provod unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, clnd, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to rescue me again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing bim from exposing to the general eye lhose marks of what they corisidcred folly, they engoged a physician that rested in this house, and took constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely affected her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him —is your love for me aught, do not go near him !\" Where, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! lruo !\" and a gain, he sank into a slate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lost many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilft his guardians observed that several times in the doy, he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, wheri, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such an awful situation, where his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, Aubrey's attention was nottracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning the intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he hod mel with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished thein still more by his expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently agoin capable of being affected by the influence of a very lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breosl, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the thought of her brothers being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to cangratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distingulshed for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lock upon her breast; opening il, whal was a surprise at heholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrail in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resomblarice of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —thon seizi rig her honds, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of eounleriance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as  In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought that was but a result of his disorder, entered, and farcing him from Miss Aubrey, decided her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be impressed, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attracting this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, and remained to pacify him and retired.\nLord Ruthven had ealled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone else. Whon he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of lt; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, hls exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenee of great affection for the brother and interest in his father, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who would resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could tell how, since he knew hor, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were inerely that he might listen to her soolhing aocents ;—jn sine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's arl, or sucb was the will of fate, Tbe a little of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important emhassy, which served as an excuse for hasteriing marriage ,( in spite of her brother's derariged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by thephysician and his guardiaris, attempted to brihethe servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and popor; just was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honaur of those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their bope and the hope of their house, to delay both a sew hours that marriage, on which he denounced the mofl heavy curfes. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to hear ass any more the mind of Miss Aubrcy by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror or that may more easily be conceived thandescribed, these notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the source of carriages broke upon the big ear. ct: Aubrey grew almostfrantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcome their vigilance, they gradually slood away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly impossible. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking a hif arm by forco, hurried him from the roam, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear —\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to the day, your fister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken blood-vessels, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardiaris might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused — who died immediately after.\nThis guardians based on protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailjng through the Grecian Arohipelago, on board one of bis Majesty vesself, in the year 1812, we went into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rothor out of the traok for ships baund to Smyrna, its bounties completely repay sor the devicltian of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for a cattlo with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named ). we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lard, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: be given Dominick, the wine-trader, fix hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English currency ,) arid has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account execited our euriosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had a residence. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floar — an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-roorn, with a spacious closet repaired. They were all simply decorated: plain glazed walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small hronze Venus iri, a loaning posture; a largo couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamher had merely a large mattress spread from the floar, with two stvffed cotton quilts and a pillow — the common hand throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed an inarble reeess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman chest in the closct: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tahlet of the recess lay VoItaires, Shakspeare's, Boileau, and Roussoau works eomplete; Volncy Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller'splay of the Robbers; Miltans Paradise Lost, an Italion edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at Constantino Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and worked with a pile of paper, on which also were reinarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said he ,\"there they must lie until his return; forhe is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, which would frown upon me for a week together; he always was very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this form for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the slated marble pilars with black plinths and fret-work cornices ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. This roof, surrounded by a light stone ablustrcle, was covered by a firie Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of a strong coarse lineri. Most of the house-tops are thus finished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking eight wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were lold, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve clocks, reading, writing, and lalking to the bimseif. \"I suppose\" said the old mon ,\"playing\" for he was very devout ,\"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle rose iri bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smooth os glass, and an horizon unsbcladed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several single islands were distinctly observed, standing the light blue wave with spots of em erald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will not ,\",\"And carinot to tell, old friend ?\" said I ,\"If I can,\" sclid he ,\"I daro not\". We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even drew them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one inan, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own land, a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and excellent character. The divorce circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch will the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money. It was evidence: he had a philarithropy of dispasitiori, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar gonius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, just Lord Byron; I met him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylerie.\" We had never then heard of his lordshlps fame, if we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret riot having been more curious in our research into the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylone on some future day; but to me that day will never relurn. I make this statement, believing it is not quite interesting, and in justice to his lordships good name, which has been grossly slaridered. He has been desoribed of an unfeelingdisposition, averse to asso-\ncalculating with human nature, or contributing in any way to foot its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly to reverse, as may both only gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of a black heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship poems, seems to have their seat in his bosoin. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: arid his courting the reposo of solitude is an additional reason sor marking a hirn as a boing on whose heart religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolenoe hath thrown her a mole. No reason can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cautiori, parlicularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares juslify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius s. To do good in secret, and shuri the world applause, if the surest testimony of a virtuous heartand self-cleaning conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cover, Flet-street.",
    "47": "THE VAMPYRE;\nct: A Talc.\nBy John Willlam Pollard.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks unlil aster the establishment of Christianity; and it has only asfumed its present forin since the division of Latin and Greek ehurches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that o Latin body could not corrupl if buried in their territory, it gradually lncroased, and forrned the subject of many wonderful storios, still extarit, of the dead rising from their grass, and In the Wost it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorrcline, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and spcedily died of consumplions; whilft these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veiris became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause lhe blood to flow from all the passage\nIn the London Journal, of March ,19732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrlsm, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, inHungary. It appears that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, th at, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, nclined Amold Poul, had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth ovt of the vampyres grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was mado, that four people had been deprised of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitling at the mouth, nose, and oars, pure and florid blood. Perhaps having been thus ohtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A black was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, which is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head,burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died from vampyrism, the least they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThis universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sick in his turn.\nChief baili-\nff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the blue subject of the present observation than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, thal the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confino his infernal visitations solely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affectjon .— A svpposition alluded toin the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tom 6 be rent; Then ghaslly about the native place, And suck the blood ofclll thy race; There from thy davghter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of Iife; Yet loatho the bariquet which perforce Must feed tby liuid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their But one that sor by crime must fall. The youngest, hesl beloved of all, Shall bless them with a father's name — That word shall wrclp the heart in flame! Yet thou must end the task and mark Her choice last thingcber eye last spark, And the last glossy glonce must view which froezes over its lifeless blue; Thori with urihallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair. Of which, in lfe o lock wbcri sh0rn Affections fondeft piece was wom — But now is borrie away by the Memorial of thino agony! Yet with lhineowri best hlood shall drip; Thy gnashlng tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these iri horror shririk away from spectro more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but heautiful poem of \"Thclloba\", the vampyre corsc of the Arabian maid Oneiza, whois represented as having relurned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him, she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being poured throughout the whole. of the tale as a complete typo of purity and innocence. The verocious Tournefort gives a long account in hif travels of sevoral astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewjtness; and CaImet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdoles, and traditionory narratives illvstrative of its efseets, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany cvrious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a riote, necessarily devoled to explanalion, clnd which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most generaI acceptance, there are several other synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vraucoloeha, Vardoulacha, GouI, Broucoloka, &\nct: THE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London writer, there appeared at the various pictures of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the sair only attracted his attention, that he might be a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whore thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensatiori of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deod grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance ta pierce through to the inward workings of the heort; hut fell upon the cheek with a leaden roy shell weighed upon the skin, it could not pass. His peculioritios caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to seo him, and those who had been accuslomed to violent oxcitemerit, and now she felt the weight of ennui, wore pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tirit, eithor srom the blush of modesty, or from tbe strong emotion of pass ion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many 0s the female hunters after notori ety attempted to win his attentions, and galn, at loast, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who badbeen lbe mockery ofevery monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage,  But though the common adultress could not influence everi the guidanco of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew who ever oddrossed himself to females. Ho had, bowever, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred ofvice. He was as often among those females who form them boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as am among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan lefl with an ordinary sister in the possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also to himsels by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while theyrelinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of meroenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many million apprentices. He believed all to sympothise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown ln by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scenc, cls we see in romances: he thought that the inisery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, bvt which were betteradapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the qualities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving to describe with least truth, their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances where he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soan led him into false nolions of his talents and his merit. Attacbed as he was to the romance of his solitary haurs, he started finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghosl, but from the wclnt of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of the pleosing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratitude vanily, he was about torelinquish basic dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossible of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assont to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hls imogination to piclure every thing that flattered ils prapensity ta extruant ideas, he soon formed this objectinto the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his preferico was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens offairs were embarrassed, and soon found, some nates of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desir loves of gaining some information relating to this singular character, who, still now, had only whetted his curiosity. , he hintedto hif guardians, that it was time for him to per from the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the care of the vice towards puttingthemselves upori an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skjes, whenever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasontry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mention his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join a bim. Flattered by such a lack of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in a woman with other men, he gladly accepted it, and iri a few days they had passed the circling waves.\nHilherta, Aubrey bad had no opportunity to study Lord Rulhven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different coriclusions from the apparent motive of his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liherolity ;— the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking that it was not upori the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon uirtuc, that he towed his alarms ;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or ta sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was f This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally p revails over the retirling hasbfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was an orie circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a ourselves upon jt, for thoy were all either led to the scafsold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject necessary. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerries with which bis companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than hc gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watcbed the society around: it was not, bowever, so when he encountered the rash yourself novice, or lhe luckless father of a numc In every town, he left the formery affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this friend; whilst many a fatber sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no moncy from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of me any, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was nol, however, capable of combining the ovnning of the moreexperienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, arid beg him to resign that charity and pleasvre which proved the ruin of hell, and did not tend to his own profit ;— bvt be delayed it — for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and almost the uarlous wild and rich sceries ofnature, was always the same: his eye for less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the canstant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystory, which that his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rorne, and Aubrey for a lime lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian country, whilst he went in search of the memories of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which was opened with eager impact-\nienee; the first was from his sister, breathing riothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before enlered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for thebellef. His guardiaris insisted upon his immediately leaving his sriend, and urgcd, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of jrresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious hahits inore dangerous to society. I had been discovered that his contempt for the adullress had riot ariginated in hatred of bor chclracter; but that he had required, to change hjs gratification, that his vlctlm, the partner of his gullt, sbould he hurled from the pinnacle of unsullicd virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infclmy and degradalion: in fine, that all tbose\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved lo invent some plausiable pretext far abandoning him altogether, purposing, ln tbe mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon received that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is soldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; bulbrey eye followed him in all his windlings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been oppointed, which would most likely end to the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he ontered the apartment of LordRuthven, and abruply asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at some time that he was aware of this being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such cls he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and immed-\niately writing a novel, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he kriew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely serit his seruant to notjfy bis complete assent to a separalion; but did not think the suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon occupied himself in lracing the faded records of aneient glory upon monumerits that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed being, of beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canuass the promised hope of the falthful in Mahomel parodise, save that her eyes spake too much mind for anyone to think she should belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the thcplain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought that gazelle was a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy 1uxurious look often suited but to be tasle of an epicure. The light step of the earth often accompa-\nnied Aubrey in his search after antiquilics, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the whole beauty of her farm, floating as it wore upon the wire, to the eager gazc of him, who forgot the letters he had just decypbered upan an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun ray such delicatelybrilliant and swiftly fclding hves, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind lbe vory object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocerice, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and still balls. Will he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a miracle for his future hours, she would stand by, arid watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing thesceries of ber nativeplace; she would then describe him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, ta him in all the glowing colours of youthfvl memary, the marriage pamp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning tosvbjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; arid often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of cl lovely female to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such life and horrible fanlasies; but Iantbe clted to him the names of old She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his harror will increase, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that lhehe could be no truth in hor fears, though at the same time he wondered al the many coins which had all tended to excile a belief in the lbe fupernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affecled virtues of the womeri among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almoft fajry sorm before him. He would tear his himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentiori upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile when he had first known. Sbe called waysseemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was boca used if she had no loriger any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, but her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very nanny. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, thoy all at once beggod of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would over remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made a light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext morning, Au Brey set off upon his excursion uncltterided; he was surprised to absorb the melanchically face of his soul, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible friends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the slope of his horse, and eamestly begged oshim to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— which promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceivo that day-light would soon end, and that in thehorizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly, gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devated country .— He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by spoed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in this southern climate, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, nig ht begins: and ore ho had advanced far, thepower of the storm was clbovo—ils echoing tbunders had scarcely an inlerval of rest—lts thick beavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse took fright, and he was carried with a dreodful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animol at last, through faligue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifled himself up from the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, ollowed him to hear the dradful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultclnt mockery of a laugh, continued in orie almost uribroken sound ;—he was started: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom hc immediately seized; wben a v oice cried ,\"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was iri vain: he was lifted from bis fect and hurled with enormous force against the ground :—his encmy threw himself upan him, The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soor heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thalch loadedon every individual straw with heavy flaros of soft. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her ories; he waf again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torchcs once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought iri a lifeless course. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his dislurbed imagination, but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretchod by his fide. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there :—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teethhaving opened the vein :— to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre!  Vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of the hor who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and furry visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were — his mind was benumbed and seemod to shuri reflection, and took refuge in vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular correction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of beer from a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, after they approached the city, forewarried the parents of some d readful catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascerlairied the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with the most violent fever, and was often delicious; in these intorvals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by saine unaccouritable combination who seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would imprecate maledies upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, srom whatever rnotive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Wheri, the latter recovered from bis delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose image hehad now combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, onlying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to bis presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared to that apathetic being who had so astanished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former mon, except that at times he was surprised to meot his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Revethenwas apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in the morning the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun ;— indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was very weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had done so distinguished him now seemed to have felt for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amid the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthes form stood by hif side—if hc saught it in the woods, her light step would appear woridering amidst the underwood, in spite of the modest violet; then suddenly turning rourid, would show, to his wild imagination, ber He determined to play scenes, every structure of which created such bitter assoclations in this mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by thetendor care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection would be attached: but though they thus haslened from place to place, yct they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom theydofended from pretended dangers. In consequence of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guordf, more to serve as a guidef than as a defence. Upon entering, bowever, a narrow deflle, at the bottom of which wcls the bed of a torrent, with lclrge masses of rock brought down from neighbouring preciplces, they had reclsori ta repent lheir negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were started by the whlstling of bullets close to their heads, and by echoed the report of several guns. In an instant, their goods had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the repart came. Lord Ruthven arid Aubrey, iintating their example, retired for a moment behind the sholtoring lurn of the office: but ashamed of being thus detoined by a foe, who with jnslating should make them advance, and being exposed to unres-\nsitting slaughter, if only of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they declared al once to rush sorward in the fear of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shell of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him — his guards having, upon Lord Ruthvens being waunded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy the promise of great reward, Avbrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was more disturbed by their presence — they being content merely to guard the entrance till their coinrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's strength rapidly deereased; it two days mortiflation ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty sleep. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eyes often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer bis assistance rather than usual earriestness —\"Assist me! you may save me — you may da more than that — I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"—\" How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey .—\"I need but a little — my life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honovr was free from stain in the world's mouth — and if rny doath were unknown for some time in England — I —I —but life. \"—\"It shall not be known. \"—\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising hiinself with exultant violence ,\"Swear hy all your soul reveres, by all your nature fear, swear that, for a year arid a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"— His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets :\" I swear !\" said Auhrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sloep; the many circumstances atlending his acquaintonco with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew nat why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shlvering came over him, as if from the president of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the m orning, he was about to enter the havel in which he had Ieft thecorpse, when a robber met him, arid informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself arid comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a ncighbouring mount, according to a promise that had given bis lordship, that will be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and talking several of the men, determined to go and bury just upon the spot where it lay. But, where he had mounted to the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered in conjeclures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which we had met with such terrible misforlunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to hoighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resalved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrncl. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects, he had bad with help belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other lings there was a case containing several weapons of offence, maro or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim.\nim. There were several daggers and a thousand. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise as finding a sheatb apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddcred—hastcning to gain further proof, he sound a weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still hc wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon thohaft and sheath were lacking in fplendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on this way home, in Rome, his first inqulries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvens detective arts. Her parents were in distress, their sortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of the bis lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the possibilities, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held a taxi. He arrived at Calais; a bridge, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and thore, for a moment, appeared to lose, iri, embraces and caresses of his sifter, all the memory of the past. If shebeforo, by her infantine caresses, bad gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching a complaint.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace, which gains the game and applause of the drawing-room assomblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the beated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy chorm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indieate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract — thejid was sedate arid perisive. When alone, her father was never brightened by the smile of joy; bull when her brother breathed to her affection, arid would in her presence forget those gifts. she knew he destroyed his reft, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes ,— that space was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world. It was thought by her guardiaris more fitting that her presentation should be delayed until her brotherturn from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which waf fast ap approaching, should be the topic of her entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the manfion of his fathers, and fed upon the melanoboly which overpowered him. He would not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the students he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soonarrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arranged as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and a call who was anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, bastened either. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was staring in a corner by bimself, hoedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in thatvery place — he felt himself suddenly soized by the arm, and the cell voice which recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blaslbirn, whon he received, clt a little distaneo, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon bis first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the form of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into a bis carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with huge rried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances started up iri dreadful array — the dclgger —his oath .— He roused himself, he could not believe it possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conveyed vp the image his mind was resling upon. It was impossible that just could be real — he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to take the assembly of a senior relationship. Leaving her under the production of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, ot 1 ast, tbat mony were leaving, he rousod himself, clnd entering another room, found his sister surrourided by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass arid get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to hiin those features he most clbhorrod. He sprang forward,scized his sister's arm, and, witb hurried step, for ced hcr towards the streel: at the door he fourid himself impedod by the crowd of servants who wore waiting for their lords; and while he was changed in passing them, he again heard that voice whifper close to him —\"Remember your oath !\"—Ho did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached homo.\nct: Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subjoct, how much more completely itengrossed, now that the territory of the monsters living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attention was now needed, and it was in vain that she instead ted hiinto explaining to her what had caused bis abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those errificed her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His goal started him ;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruiri upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not utter its progress? This very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and close his superiors, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but the deal, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, who remained in this state; should up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support the culture. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which havnted him. His dress became negleeted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the Monday suri as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he relurried with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to relax wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any — from thought. His c conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a friend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarri, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Rulhuen approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his haggard and fuspicious looks were so striking, hisinward shudderings so visible, that his slster was at last abliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offectod him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his rnirid was becoming alionated, they thought it high time to resume against that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesjrous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the generaleye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, but he was confined to his hamber. There would often live for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre ;— the only sign of affeclion and recollection romaining displclyed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch the bim—if your love for me isaught, do not go near him !\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was ,\"True! Thrive !\" and again he took into a state, when she did not even rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a dofinite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, once of his guardian entering his room, began to coriverse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstances of Aubreysbeing in so clwful situation, when his sister was going the next day to be married. Instantly, everybody's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning inlellect, if they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. The inking lhis was a young Earlwbom he had met with in society. A ubrey seemed pleased, and aslonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the initials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for being pressedher to bis breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with lears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warinth, and to concentrate her upon her marriage with a person so distriguished for rank and every accomplishment; when hc suddenly perceived a locket upon ber result; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. Hc asked the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did riot understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenarico, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for he — But he could not advance — it seemed as if that voice again bade bim remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthveri was near him but saw no one In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forciring him from Miss Aubrey, did her to leave him. He fell upon his kriees to them, he implored, he begged off them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity, they imagined the hadtaken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had called this morning after the drawing room, and had been refused with everyone else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, which readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he Iearned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He basteried to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother on the inlerest iri bis fate, he gradually won the ear of Mjss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hlstongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of bjmself as of an individual having no sympathy with ony being on the crowded earth, save with her to whoin be addressed hlmself;—could toll how, sinco be knew her, bis existence, hadbegun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents ;—iri fine, hc knew so well how to use the serious art, or such was the will of fale Thetitle of the elder branch falling cll length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for haslening the marriage ,( in spite of her brother's deranged state ,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and poper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conveying her, os she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of lhose now in the grave, wbo once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sacrifices promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more than the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravirings of a maniac. Night passed ori without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may moro easily be conceived than described, the notes of bufy preparatiori. ct: Marning came, and the sound of carrlages brake upon his ear. ct: Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at least overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bond, was out of the room, and in a moment, himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached him, and took his arm by force, hurricd him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his oath —\" Remember your oath, andknow, if not my bride to the day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail !\" So saying, he passed him towards his attendees, who, roused by the old woman, could come into search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a vent, had broken a bicycle, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The inarriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrey weakness, iricreasod; the fusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister guardians might be called, and when the midnight he had slruck, he related composedly what the reader had peruscd — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, the original province of his guide .\"\nIN Sajling through the Greoian Archipelaga, on board one of bis Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we pull into the harbour of Mitylene, on the lhc island of that name. The be auty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, indvice mariy Britlsh vossels to visit it—both men of war and merchantinen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships hound that Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; cls usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whllst the men were employed in water, and the purser bargolning for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Hamer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek class our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. ct :\"He engaged me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have talked to me with him; but I did not have a chance to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. Thc contact over the hill, facing the hlll, facing the hlll, facing the hlll, facing the hlll, belonging to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it ,( about L 250 English verrency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his folucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiously very much, and we lost no time in a vacancy to the house where our countryman had rosided. We were kindly received by an old man, who corrected us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all fimply decorated green-stained walls, marlc tablef on either side, a large meter in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could bc mclde to play through the bronches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in cl leaning posture; a large eouch or sofcl complete the fumiture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, a mirror, a singlo painting. The bedohamber holds merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottonquilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting room we observed a marble reoess, formerly, the old rnan told us to be filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman. Those in the closet. : it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recofs lay Voltoires, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimrnerman, in the Gcrman languclge; Klopstock's Messiah; Katzebues novels; Sehiller's play of the Robberf; Milton's Parodise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pclrma in 181 O; several small pamphlets Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Mossiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The lord had been reading these books the evening be fore he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" said ho ,\"there they must lie until hisreturn; for he is so particular, lhot were I to move anything without orders, he would frown upan ine for a weck together; he is otherwise very good. I once did bim a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zeohines which I pay to an aged Armeriiari who resists in a small coltage in the wood, arid whom the lord brought here from Adrianoplc; I don't know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasing. The portico in front walls fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work connections ,( as it is now customary in Grecian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone blocktrade, walls covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them, the Greeks pass their evening smoking, drinking light with news, such as \"lachryma Christian\", catiring fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the lefthand as we cntered the bouse, a small streainlet glided away, grapes, orariges and limes were clovering together on its borders, and under the sbade of two largo myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an omamental wooden back wall placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, arid talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" for he was very devout ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be called \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, clrid on the summil of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream squiring from the ruins described in broken cascades, until it was lost in the roads near the mountain base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminoles the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a videomore than I did this; but our cnquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who bad resided in this romantic solitude: none kriew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could tell, but I am sure he will riot ,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friends ?\" said I —\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but our return to the town we learnt several peculiars of the local lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisher man who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eocentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself to use it.\nSuch was the information with which we doparted from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greee could be. Hc child money it was evident: he held a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. ct: Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in a company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said he ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met hlm in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never heard of his lordship fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Horolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every place. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled oursolvcs with the idea of returning to MityIene on some future day; but to run that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it is not quite uninteresting, and in spite of his lordships, a good name, which has her grossly slandered. He has been described.\nbed as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to shout its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in this lordship poems, seem to have their seat in his room. Tenderncss, syinpatby, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the reposo of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being ng on whose heart religion hath set her sea, and over whose head Benevolerice half thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give a fair opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortally. Lord Byron's character is a worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world applause, is the surest testiony of a virtual beart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-sleet."

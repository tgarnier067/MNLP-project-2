            "Aubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\n"

            "THE VAMPYRE;\n",
            "A Tale.\n",
            "By John William Polidori\n",
            "THE superstition upon which this tale ls founded is very goneral in the Eost. Amang the Arabians it appears ta be comrnon: il did not, however, extend itself lo the Greeks vntil after tho establishment of Christianity; and it has only clssumed its preſenl form since the divlsion of the Latin arid Greck churches; at which time, the idca becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could nol corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and forrned the subject of mariy wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the bIood of lhe young and beautjful. In tho West it spread, with some slight variati0n, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, clnd Lorraine, where the bellef existed, that vampyreſ nightly imbibed a certain portiori of the blood of their viclims, who became emaciated, lost their strongth, and speediIy died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckerſ fattened—and their veins became disterided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodles, and euen from the very porcſ of their skins.\n",
            "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is o curious, and,of covrse, credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an exarnination 0f the commander-in-chief and magiftratos of the plaee, they positively and unanimousIy affirmed, that, about five years bef-\n",
            "ore, a cerlain Heyduke, named Amold Paul, had been hcard lo say, that, at Cassovia, on lhe froriticrs of the Turkjsh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himsclf with his bl0od. Thif precaution, however, did not prevent hirn from becoming a vclmpyre himseIf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial,many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four pcrsons had beeri deprived of life by his attacks. To provent furthcr mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is suppased to be usual in caseſ of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and ernitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they ros0rted to lhe accustomcd remedy. A slake was driven eritirely tbrough thc heart and body of Arnold Paul, al which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. Thif done, lhey cut off his head, burned his body, andthrew the ashes into bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of thoseperfans who had previously died from vampyrisin, lest they shouId, in their turn, become agenls vpon others who survived them.\n",
            "The universal belief is, that a person ſucked by a vampyre bec0mes a vampyre himself, and sucks in hiſ turn.\n",
            "Chief bailiff.\n",
            "This inonstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better odapted to jllustrate the subject of the present ohservatjons than any 0thcr instance which cauld be adduced. In many parts of Grecce it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, f0r some heinous crime committcd whilst in existence, that lhe dececlsed is not only doomed to vampyrise, bvt compelled to confirie hls infernal visitations solely lo those bcings he loved most while upon earth—thofe to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and afsection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\n",
            "But first on earth, af Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly baunl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain lhe streom of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy liuid living corse, Thy victimf, ere lhey yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must faIl, The youngest, best beloved of alI, Shall bless lhee with a father's name— That word sball wrap thy heart in flamo! Yet thov must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye'ſ last spark, And the last glassy glance must vicw Which free2es o'er its lifeless bluo; Then with unhallowed hand ſhall tear The treſses of her yellow hair, Of whlch, in life a lock when shom Asfection's fondost plcdge was worn— But now is horno away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing t0oth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afritf rave, TlIl the se in horror shrink awcly From spectre inore accursed than they.\n",
            "Mr. Southey hos also iritroduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returncd froin the grave for tbe purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilsl in existence. But this cannol be supposod lo have resultcd from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourlrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a cornplete type 0f purity and innocencc. The veraciouſ Tournefort gives a long aceount in his travels of several astonishing cases of uampyrisin, to which he pretends to have been an cyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upori this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustralive oflts esfects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending t0 prove it to be a c lassical, as well as barbarian error.\n",
            "Many curious and intorefting notices on this singularly horrible superstition mighl be added; thoughthe present may suffice for the limits of a nate, necessorily devo-\n",
            "ted to explanati0n, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that thougb the term Vampyre iſ the one in most general aooeptation, there are several 0thers ſynonymous with it, made use of in various parts of lhe worId: as Vroucolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\n",
            "THE VAMPYRE.\n",
            "IT happcried that in the midst of the dissipcllions attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of lhe lon a nobleman, more remarkablo for hiſ singvlarities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around hiin, as if he could not participotothereiri. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his altention, that he might by a look quell it, and lhrowfear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those wha felt this sensatian of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the deadgrey eye, which, fixing upon the object's faoe, did not seem to penetrate, ond at one glance to pierce through to the inword workings of the heclrt; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it cauld not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited lo every house; all wished to see him, and tbose who had been aecustomed to violerit excitement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having ſomething in tbeir presence capable of engaging their altention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, eithor from the blvsh of modesty, or srom the strong emotiori of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, mariy of the femalo hunters aftcr notoriety atlempted ta win his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affectian: Lady Mercer, who had heen the mockery of every monster shewn in drawjng-roams sirice her morriage, threw herself in his way, and djd all bvt put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she st0od before him, though his eyes wcre apparently fixed upon hor's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her uriappalled impudence waſ baffled, and she left the field. But tbough the comman ad ultress could riol influence even lhe guidclnce af his eyes, il was not that the female sex was indifferent to hirn: yet such was the apparent caution witb whioh he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few kriew he ever addreſsed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wirining t0ngue; and whethcr it waf that it even overcame the dread of his singular characler, or that lhey were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be was as often among those females who form lhe boclst of their sex from thcir domestic virtues, as among those who sul1y it by tbeir vices.\n",
            "Aboul the samctimc, th ere came to L0ndon a yourig gentleman os the name ofAvbrey: he was an orphan left with an only sisler in tho possession of great wea1th, by parents who died while he was yel in chiIdhood. Left also to bimself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortvne, while they relinquisbed the more important chargeof his mind to the care of mercenclry subalterns, he cultivated inore his imaglnatlon lhan his judgment. He had, hence, that high r0mantjc feeling of honour clnd candour, which daily ruins so mony milliners' apprcntices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vioe was thrown in by Pr0vidonce merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thaught that the misery of o cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the pairiter's eye by th eir irregular folds and various co1oured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreclms of poets were the rea1ities of life. Hc was handsomo, frank, arid rich: for these reclsons, upon hiſ entering into the gay circles, many mothers furrovnded hjm, slriving whichshould descrjbe with least truth thoir lariguishing or romping favourjtes: the doughters at tbe same time, by their brightenirig countenances wheri be approacbcd, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into fcllse notions of his talents and bis merit. Attached as he was t0 the romance of hif solitary hours, he wasstartled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wox caridles that flickered, not from tbe presence of a ghost, but from want of sriuffing, there was rio foundation in real life for clny of that congeries of pleasing pjctures and descriptions contained jn those volumes, from which he had f0rmcd his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above described, crossed him in bis career.\n",
            "He watcbed him; and the very impoſsibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in bimself, who gave few other signs of his observation of oxternal abiects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hif imaginatian to pictvre every thing tbat slattered its propensity to extrovagant ideas, he soon formed thisobject into the hero of a romance, and dctermined to observe tho offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted wlth him, paid him attentlons, and s0 far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs wcre embarrassed, and soon faund, from the notes of preparation iri — Streot, tbat he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, wh0, till now, hod only whetted his euriosjty, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for birn t0 perform the tour, which for inany generations has been thoughl necessary to enable the young to take some rclpid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to clppear as if fallen from thc skies, whcnever scandalous intrigves are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degreo of skill shewn in carryjrig lhem on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his lntentions to Lord Ruthven, waf surprised to rcceive from hlm a proposal lo jainhim. Flatterod by such a mark of estecm srom him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the cjrcling waters.\n",
            "Hitherto, Aubrcy had had no opportunity of study ing Lord Ruthven'ſ character, and now he found, that, though many moro of his act-\n",
            "i0ns were exposed to his view, the results offcred different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His compclnion was profuse in his lib erality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than onough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubreycauld not avojd remarkirig, that it was not upon the uirtuous, reduced t0 indigence by the misfortunos altendarit even up0n virtue, that be bestowed hjs alms;—these were sent from the doar with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to osk something, not to relieve hiſ wants, 6ut to allow him towallow in his lust,or to sink him still dceper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charjty. This was, howover, attributed by him to the greoter imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigenl. There was one circumstance about the charity af his Lordship, whicb was still more impressed upori his mind: clll those upon whom it was bestowed, jnevitably found tbat there was a curse upon it, for they were al1 eith er Ied to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other lowns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his campanion soughl for the centres of all fashionable vice; tberc hc entered into a1l the spiril of thc faro tclble: he betted, and alwa ys gamb1ed with success, except where lhe known sharper was his clntag0nist, and then be lost even more thcln he gained; but it was always with the same uncbanging face, with wbich ho generally watched the society around: it was not, however, ſo wben he encountered the rash youthful navice, or the luckless father of a numcrous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstraotedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more firo than thot of the cat whilsl dallying with the half-deod mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent yauth, torn srom the circle he adorned, cursing, in the ſ0litude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single fartbing of his lateimmense wealth, wherowith to buy even ſufficierit to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immedicltely lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder hc had just snatched from the convulfive grasp of the innocent:this might but be thc result of a certain degree of knowledge, which waſ not, however, capable of combating thecvnning of the more experienced. Avbrey 0ften wished lo represent this to bis friend, and bcghim to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—far each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of spcaking frclnkly and opo nly to hirn; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven jn his carriage, and amidst the uarious wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwaysthe same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification froin it than the constanl excitement os vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exa1ted imagination begari to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\n",
            "They soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a tiine lost sight of his compclnion; he left him jn daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Itallan countess, whilst he went in scarch of the rnemorials 0f ari0ther almost deserted city. Whi1st he wcls thus engagod, letters arrived from England,which be opened with eager impatierice; the first was from his siſter, breathing riothing but asfection; the others were from his guardians,the latter astonished him; if it had bofore entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these ſeemcd to give him sufficient rcason for lhe helief. His guardians insifted upon hls immediately leavlng his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrosiſtible p0wers of soduction, reridered bjs 1icentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been disoovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatrod of her choracter; but thathe had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, tbe partncr of his guilt, shovId be hurled from the pinnacle of unsul1ied virtv e, down to the lowest abyss of infamy clnd degrcldation: iri fine, that all thase femaleſ whom he hcld ſought, appareritly on account of their vjrtue, had, since his departure, tbrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of tbeir vices to the pubIic gaze.\n",
            "Aubrey determined upon leavjng one, whose choracter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolued to invent some p1ausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposjng, ln the mean while, lo watcb him more closely, and to let no slighl cjrcuinstances pass by unnoticed. He entored into the same circle, and so0n perceived, that bis Lordship was endeavouririg to work upon the inexperionce of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequeriled. In Italy, it is seldom thot an unmarricd female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on bis plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered lhat an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innooent, though th0ughtless g irl. Losing rio time, he entercd the apartmerit of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly aſked him his intentions with rcspect to the lady, iriforming him at the same time that he was aware of hls being about to mect her that verynight. Lord Ruthven answerod, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have vpori such an occasion; and upon being presscd whe-\n",
            "ther he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing o note, to say, thal from that moment he must decline accompanying hls Lordship in the remajnder of their pr0posed tovr, he 0rdered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her 0f all be knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of hls Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day mercly sent his servarit to riotify his complete assent to a separation; hut did not hjnt any suspiclon of his plans havirig been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\n",
            "Having left Rome, Aubrey dirocted bis steps towards Greece, and orosſing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Alhcns. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon ocoupied himsclf in traeing the faded records of ancient g lory upon monuments lhat apparenlly, ashamed of chronicling lhe deeds of sreemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and de1icate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope ofthe faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plclin, or tripped along the mou ntain's side, orie would have thought the gclzelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated natvre, sar thot sleopy luxuriovs look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search aftor antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole heauty of her form, floating as it were upon tbe wind, lo the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upori an almost offacod tahIet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Ofteri would her tresses falllng, as she flitled around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it migbt wol1 excuse the forgetfulness af the antlquary, who let escclpe from his mind the very objecthe had before thougbt of vital imporlance to the pr opor intcrpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but norie con appreciate?—It was innoccnce, youlh, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-ro0ms and stif1ing baIls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preſerve a meinorial sor his fvture hours, she would stand by, and wotch the rnagic esfects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her notive place; she would theri describe to him the circling dance up0n thc open ploin, w0uld paint, lo him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greatcr impression vpon her mind, w0uld tell him all the supernatural talcs of ber nurse. Her earnestriess and apparent bolief of what shenarrated, excited lhe interest even of Aubrey; and aften as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his frjendf, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upori the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence sor the ensuing months, hiſ blood would run cold, whilst be attempled to laugh her ovt of ſuch idle and horrihle fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him tbe names of old men, who hadat last detected one living among themselves, after several of lheir near relatives and childr en had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; clnd when shefound him so incredulous, shebegged af him to bolieve her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had darcd to question their existence, olways had somo proof given, which obliged them, with grief and hearlbreaking, to confess it was trvo. She detailed to him tbe troditiorial appoaronce of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate dcscription 0f Lord Ruthven; he, bowever, slill persisted in persuclding her, thal there could be no truth in ber fears, though at thc sametimc he wondered at themany coincidences which bad all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\n",
            "Aubrey hogan to attach himself more and more to Iarithe; hcr innocence, so contrasled with all the affectod virtues of the women among whom hc had sought for his vision of romance, won hls heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englishhabits, ina rrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more ond more attached lo the almost fairy form befare him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, f0rming a plan for some anliquarian research, he would depart, detormined not to return vntil his object wcls attained; but he always found it imposfible to fix hif attention upon tbe ruins araund him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the righ tful possessor of his thaughls. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was eucr the same frarik infantile being he had first kriown. She always seemed to part from him withreluctance; but it was because she hod no 1onger any one with whom sbe could visit hcr favourite hauntf, whilst her guardian was occupiodin sketching or uncovering some fragmentwhioh had yet escaped tbe destructive harid of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several presenl, affirmed their existence,pale with horror at the very name. Soon aster, Aubrey determined t0 proceod upon one of his exoursions, which was to detain him f0r a few hours; when they heard the name of tho place, they all at once begged of him riot to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would evcr reinain, after thc day had closed, upon any c0nsiderat ion. They described it as the resorl of the vampyres iri their nocturnal orgies, and denouriced the most heavy evils af impending upori him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey inade light of their representatians, and tried to lough tbem out of the idea; but whenbe saw thein shudder at his daririg thus to mock a superior, infemal pawer, thc very name of which apparently made tbeir bIood freeze, he waf silent.\n",
            "Next morning Auhrey set off upon his excursion uriattended; he wossurprised to o6serve the melancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those h0rrible fiends, had inspjred them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Iantbe came to the sidc of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he prornised. Hc was,however, so occupied in his research, that be did nol perceive that day-light wauld soon end, and that in the borizon there was one os those specks which, jn tho warmer climales, so rapidly gather into a trernendous mass, ond pour aIl thoir rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, m0unted hif horse, dotermined to rnake up by speed for his delay: but it was too lote. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the svn ſets, riight begins:and ero he bad advanced far, the power of tbe storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick beavy rcliri forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst tbe blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took sright, and he was carrled witb drecldful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, slopped, and he found, by the glare of lightnlng, that he waf in tbe neighbourhood of a hovel lhat hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrovnded it. Dismovnting, he approached, hoping to find some one to gujde him to the l own, or clt least trusting to obtain ſhelter from the pelting of tbc storm. Af he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed bim to hear the dreadful shrieks of a wornan mingljng with the ſtifled, exultant mockeryof a lavgh, continued jn one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with o svdden effort, forced open the daor of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, tbough he called, still the sounds eoritinued, and no notice waf taken of him. He found himself in contacl with some one, whom he immediately soi2ed; when a uoice crled, \"Again baffIed!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; ond he felt himself grappled by onc whose strength seemed superhumari: determined lo sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from bis feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself vpon him, and kneelirig upon his breast, hadplaced his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave Iight in the day, disturbed hiin;—he instanlly rose, and, leaving his prey, rvshed thr ough the door, and iri a momeril the crashing of the branches, as be broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; arid Auhrey, incapabIe of movin g, was soon heard by those without. They enlered; the light of their torches fell vpon tbe mvd walls, and the tbatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flclkes of saot. At the dcsire of Aubrey they seorched for her who had attracted hiin by her ories; ho wos again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of lhe torches once more hurst upon hlm, to perceive the airyform of his foir oonductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visiori ariſing from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same farm, when ho unclosed them, strctched by his side. There was no eolour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness a bout her foce that seemed almost as attaching as the life thclt once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat wore thernclrks of teeth having opened the vein:—to thiſ the men pointod, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickIy formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side os her who had lately been to him the object os so many brighl and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of lise that had died wilhin her. He knew not what his tboughls were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and takc refuge in vacaricy—he hold almost unconsclously in his hand a riaked dagger of a pclrticular construction, which hod heen found in the hut. They were soon met by differenl parties who bad becri engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the cily, forewarned lhe parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To deſcribe their gricf would be impos sible; but when they ascertained the cause of their c hild's dcath, they looked al Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were jnconsolable; both died brokeri-hearted.\n",
            "Aubrey boing put to bed waſ seized with a most violent fever, and waſ often delirious; iri these intervals he would call upon LordRuthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combinotlon he seerned to beg of his former companion to ſpare the heirig he loved. At other times he would imprecate malediclions up0n hls bead, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time ta arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately ploced bimself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. Wheri the latter recovered from hiſ dclirium, he was horrisied and startled at the sigbt of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying aImast repcntance for the fault that had cauſed their separation, and still more by the ottention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconoiled bim to his presence. His lordship seeinedquite changed; he n0 longer appeared that apathetie belrig who bad so asloriishod Aubrey; but of saon as his convaleſcence began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into tbe same statc of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difserence from the former man, except thclt at times he was surprised lo meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of maIici0us cxultati0n playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smi1e hauntod him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven waf appar ently engaged in watching the tideleſs waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking lhe progress of those or6s, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, be appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of aIl.\n",
            "Aubrey's mind, by this shock, waſ much weakened, and lhat elasticlty of spirit which had 0nce so distinguiſhed him now seemed to have sled for ever. He was now as muoh a louer of solitude and silencc as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished sor solilude, his mind could not find it in the neigh6ourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stoad by his side—if hc sought il in the woods, her light step wovld appear wandering amidsl the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; theri suddenly turning round, would sbow, to hjs wild imagination, her palc face and woundod throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined t0 fly scenes, every seclture of which created such bitter associatioris in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the lender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit thosc parts of Greece neither had yet seeri. Thcy travelled in every direction, and sought every spot lo wbich a reoolIection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yct they seemed not lo heed what tbey gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they irnagined were only thc invention of individuals, whose interest it wcls to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from protcnded darigers.In consequence of thus neglecting the advlce of the irihabitants, on one occasion they travelled witb only a fow guards, more ta scrvc cls guides than as a de fence. Upon entering, bowever, a riarrowdefile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses 0f rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiceſ, tbey had reason to repent thelr negligenco; for scarcely were the whole of lhe party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of 6ullets cIose to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, plaoing themselves hehjnd rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, rctired for a moment bchind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with irisulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, jf any of the robbcrs shou1d climb ahoue and take thom in the reor, they determined at onco to rush forward in search of the eriemy. Hardly had lhey lost theshelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to lhe grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest 0r his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately throwri up their arms and surrendered.\n",
            "By promjseſ of greclt rew-\n",
            "ard, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wourided friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having ogreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by thoir presence—they beingcontent mcrely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pramised sum, for which he bad an order. Lord Ruthven's ſtrength rapidly dccroased; in two days mortification ensued,arid deatb seemed advancing with hasty stepf. His conduct and appcarance had notchanged; be seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his rnind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixod upon Aubrey, who waſ induced lo offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more lhan that—I mean riot my life, I heed the death of my existence as little af that of thc passing day; but you may save my hariaur, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Avbrey.—\"I need but littlc—my 1ife ebbs apace—I cclnnol explain the whole—but if you would oonceal all y0u know of me, my hanour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall nol bo known.\"—\"Swear!\" crjed the dyirig man, raising himself with exullant vi0lence, \"Swear hy all your sou1 reveres, by all y0ur nature feors, sweclr that, for a yeor ond a day you will not iinpart your knowled ge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His cyeſ seemed burſting fr0m their ſockels: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he funk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no rnore.\n",
            "Aubrey rctlred lo rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstanccs attending his aoquaintance with this man r0se upon his inind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a c0ld shiverlng came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment 0f somethirig horrible awaiting him. Rising early in lhe morning, he was about to eriter thc hovcl in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met birn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having beeri conveyed by hirnself and comrades, upon his retiring, to tho pinnacle of a rieighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lor dship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon thatrose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined lo go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, wherihe had mounted to the summit he found n0 lrace ofeitber the corpse or the clothes, thaugh tho robbers swore they pointed out the identical r0ck on whioh they had 1aid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convincod tbat they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\n",
            "Weary of a counlry in which he had met wjth such terriblc misf0rtunes, and in wbich allclpparently conspired to heighten that superslitious rnelancholy that had seized upon his mind, he rcsolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to oonuey him to Otranto, or ta Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging ta Lord Ruthven.Amongst other lhjngs there wcls a cafe containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the deatb of the victim. Thero were several daggerſ and ataghanſ. Whilst turning them over, and examining thcir curious sorms, what was his svrprise at finding a sheatb opparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastoning to gain further pro0f, he fourid the weapon, and hishorror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly sbaped, the shealh he held in his hand. His eyes seerned to need no furthor certainly—they feemed gazlng to be bound to the dclgger;yet still he wished to disbelievc; but the particular form, tho same varying tints upon the haft and sbeatb were alike in splcridour on both, and left no room for doubl; there were also drops of bIood on each.\n",
            "He left Smyrna, and on hisway home, at Rome, hjs fjrst inquiries were coricerning the lady he had attempled to snatch fr0m Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distrcss, their fortune rujned, and fhe had not boen heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he wos afraid that this lady had fallen a vietim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morafe and sllent; and his only occupationconsisted iri urging the speed of the postill0ns, as if he were going to save tbe life 0f some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; o breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of bjs fathers, and there, for a momcrit, appeared to lose, iri the embraces and oaresses of his sister, olI memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantjne oaresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a eompanion.\n",
            "Miss Aubrey had not thclt winning grace which gains the gaze and applouse of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that ljght brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never Iit up by the levity of tbe mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it whichdid not seem to arise from mlsfortune, hut from some feeling within, tbat appearedto indicate cl soul conscious of a brighter realm. Hcr step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a 6utterfly or a colour may attract—it was fedate and pensive. When olone, her face was never 6rightened by the smile of joy; but when her hrother breathed to her his affectjon, and wouId in her presence sorget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would bclve exchariged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were theri playing in lhe ligbt of their own natiue sphere. Shewas yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been tbought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayod vntil her brother's return from tbe continent, when he mjght be her protector. It was now, thoresore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fasl approachirig, fhould be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mclnslon of his fathers, and fed upon lhc melancholy which averpowered him. He could nol feel interest about the frivolities of fashiona ble strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; 6ut he determined to sacrifice his own comf0rt to the protection of his sister. They ſoon arrived in town, and prepared for the nexl day, which had been announced as a drawing-r oom.\n",
            "The cr0wd was exceſsive—a drawlng-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smi1e of roycllty, haslened thither. Aubrey wcls there with his sister. Whjle he was standing in a corner by himſelf, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time ho had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in that vory placc—he felthimself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sovnded in bis ear—\"Remem6er your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, searsul of feeing a spectre tbat would blast him, when he perceivod, at a litlle distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice 0n thif spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost resusjrig to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm 0f a friend, and forcing a passage through the crawd, he threw himsels into his carriage, and was drlven home. He poced tho room with hurried steps, arid fixed his hands upon his head, aſ if he were afraid his thoughts were bvrsting from his brain. L0rd Ruthven again bes ore him—circumstances starled up in dreadful arrcly—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himsels, he couldnot beliove it possible—thc dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossihle that it could be real—be determinod, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his ljps, and he could not sueceed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his slstor to the assembly of a ncor relation. Leavlng her undor the protection of a matr0n, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thougbts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering anothcr room, fourid his ſister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest converscltion; he attempted to pasſ and get near her, whcn one, whom he requested to movc, turned round, ond revealed to him lh0se features hc most a6horred. He sprang forward, seized hls sister's arm, and, with hurriod step, forced her towards the street: at the door he f0und bimself impeded by the crowd of ſervarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he waſ engaged iri passing them, he agaln heclrd that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He didnot darc lo turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\n",
            "Aubrey became almost diftracted. If bes0re hismind had been absorbed by onc subject, how rnuch more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster'f living again proſsed upon his thovgbts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was ln voin that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He on1y uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more he thought, the more be was bewildcred. His oath startledhim;—was he then to a1low lhls monster lo raam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by hiin. But even if he were to break his oath, and disc1ose his suspicions, wbo would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretoh; bvt death, he remembered, had been already m0cked. For days he rernained in tbis state; shut up in hifroom, be saw ri0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sclke, to support natvre. At lasl, no longer capable af bearing stillness and solitvde, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly thclt iinage which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, cls oflen oxposed to the noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed peaple to follow him; but thcy were soon distanoed hy bim wh0 fled from apursuer swifter than any—frorn thought. Hiſ conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of bis friends, with a fiend amongst them, os whosc presence they were unconscious, he determined t0 enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxi0us to farewam, in spite of his oath, aIlwhom Lord Ruthven appraached with jntimacy. But wheri he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious lookf were so striking, his inward sbudderings so visib1e, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strangly. Wheri,however, romanstrance proved unavailirig, the guardions thought properto interpoſe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they th0ught it high tiine to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parenls.\n",
            "Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountcred in hjs wanderlngs, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those inclrks of what they consjdercd folly, lhey engoged a physician to reside in the h0use, and take coristant care of him. He hardly appeclred to notice it, sa cornpletely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at 1ast so greclt, that he was confined to hls chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He bad became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and reoollection remainirig displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then ho would sometimes start, and, soizing her hands, with looks that severely afflieted her, he would desire hcr not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch bim—if your lovefor me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reserred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into cl state, w herice not even she could rouse him. Thls lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was pasſing, hjs incohorences became less srequent, and his mind threw off a portion ofitf gloom, whilst his guardians observed, thot several times in the day he would covnt upon hisfingers a definite number, and then smile.\n",
            "The time had nearly elapsed, w hen, upon the last day of the year, ono of his guardians erilering his room, began to converse with hjs physician upori the me1aricholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, wheri his sister was going next day to he married. InstantIy Aubrey's atlention was attraeted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark ofreturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with ln society,Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be prosent at the nuptials, and desiring lo see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. Hc was apparentIy again capable os being asfected by lhe inf1uence of her lovely smile; for he pressed hor to his breast, and kissed her cheek,wet with tears, flowing at the lhought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with allhis wonted warmth, and to congrotulate her upon her marriage wlth o person so distinguifhed forrank clnd every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceiued a looket upon her breast; opening it, whal was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who bad so lorig inflvencedhis life. He seized the portrait in a par0xysm of rage, and trclmpled it under soot. Upon her askirig hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblclnce of her future hufband, he looked as if he didnot understand her—then seizing ber hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she wov1d never wed thif monster, for he— But he covld not advarice—it seemed as if that voice agclin bade him rcmernber his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lard Rulhven was near him but saw no one. In the meantimethe guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought tbis waf but cl relurn of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. Ho fell upon his knees to them, he irnplored, he begged of them to do1ay but for one day. They, attrjbuting this to the insanity tbey imagined had takeri possessi0n of his mind, cndeavoured to pacisy hirn, and rctired.\n",
            "Lord Ruthven had eaIled the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refuscd with every one elfe. Wberi he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cavse of it; but when he learned that he was deerned inſane, his exultatjon and pleasure could hardly bo concealed from those among whom he hcld gained this information. He hastened lo the house of his former eompanion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affectiori for tbe brother and intereft in his fate, he gradually wan the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who cauld resist his power? His ton guohad dangers and toils to recounl—could speak of himself as of an indivldual having no sympathy wlth any being on the crowded earth, ſavc with her to whom he addressed himself;—couId tell how, since he knew her, hif existence, had begun to seem worthy of proservation, if jt were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knewso well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the wiIl of fate, that he gained her asfections. The title of the elder branoh falling at lerigth to him, be obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hofteriing lhe marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged ſlate,) which was to take place the uery day before his departure for the continent.\n",
            "Aubrcy, when he waſ left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to hribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it waf given him; he wrote a 1otter to his sisler, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the hon0vr af those now ln the graue, who once held her in their arms af lheir hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few haurs that marriage, on which he denounced lho most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it bettor not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to tho busy inmatef of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilanoe, they grcldually stole away, leavirig him in the cvstody of an helplesf old woman. He seized thc opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in cl mornent found himsels in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the firſt to percejve hirn: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him srom the room, speechless with r age. When on tho stoircase, Lord Ruthven whjspered in his ear—\"Reinember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is disbonoured. Women are frail!\" So ſaying, he pushed him towards his ottendants, wha, raused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey covld no langcr support bimfe1f; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, andhe was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicjan was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\n",
            "Aubrey's weakness jncreased; the effusion 0s blaod produced symptoms of the near approach ofdeath. He desircd his sister's guardians might be called, and when lhe midnight hour had struck, he rel ated coinposedly whot the reader has pervsed—he dicd immediately after.\n",
            "The guardionshastened to protecl Mlss Aubrey; but when thcyarrived, it wcls too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's fister had glutted thc thirsl of a VAMPYRE!\n",

The beauty of this pIace, and tho certain supply of cattle and vegetables olways to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies ralher out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for lhe deviation of a voyage. We landed; as vsual, at the boltom of the bay, clnd whilst the men were employed jn watering, and the purser hargaining for cattIe with the natives, the clergymari and myself took a rainble to the cave called Homer's Scbool, arid other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we mel with and engaged a young Greek as our guido, wbo lold us he had come from Scio with an Engljsh lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" sajd the Groek, \"and would have taken mc with him; bul I did not choose to quit Mitylene, whero I am likely to get married.

            "The old man said: \"The 1ord had been reading these books the evening before he sai1ed, and forgot to place them with the athers; but,\" sald he, \"there they must lie until his return; for heis fo particu1ar, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frawn up0n me far a week t0gether; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; arid I have the produce of this fclrm for the troub1e of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I poy to an aged Armenian whorcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought hore from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\n",
            "The appearance of the house extcrnally was pleasirig. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were conſjderably higher than the roof. The ro0f, surr ounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey oarpet, beneath an awning of strongcoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furriished, as upon them thc Greeks pass their euenings in smoking, drinking ljght wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frvit, and enjoying the cvening breeze.\n",
            "On the left hand as we entered lhehouse, a small stream1et glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clusteririg together on itſ borders, arid undor lhe shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marbIe seat with an 0rnamenlal wooden baek was placed, on which wc were told, the lord passed many 0f his evenings ond njghts till twelvo o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the ald man, \"praying\" for be was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a wee k, besidef Sundays.\"\n",
            "Thc view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bjrd's-eyc view.\" A line of rlch vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins deſcended in broken cascadef, until it was l0st in the woods near the mountain's basc. The sea smoath as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a IittIe on the left, lhrough a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islonds were distinclly observed, studdirig the light blue waue with spotſ of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did tbis; bvt ovr enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but D0minick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeriian,\" said our conduct0r, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannat you lell, old friend?\" ſaid I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not lime to visit the Armeniari, but on our return to the town welearnt several particvlars of the isolated lord. He had portionod eight young girls when be wos last upan the lsland, and even daneed with them at the nuptial feast. He gave acow to ane mcln, horſes to otbers, and cotton and silk to the glrls who live by weaving lhese articles. He aIso bought a new boat for a fisherman who had loſt his own in a gale, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor children. Iri short, he appeared to uſ, from all we eollected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One ciroumstance welearnt, whioh our old friend at the coltage thought proper nat to disclose. He had o mosl beautifvl davghter, with whom the lord waſoften seeri walking on tbe sea-shore, and he had b0ught her a plano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\n",
            "Such was the informcltion with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing wha tbis ramblcr in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he hod philanthropy of dispositiori, and all those ecce nlrlcities which mark peculiar g enjuſ. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupll of WYATT'S, who bad been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the lsland of Tenedos, arid I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never lhen heard os his lordship's fame, as we had been same yearf from home; but \"Childo Harolde\"heing put into our hands we rccognized the recluse of CaIcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having 6een more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we oonsoled ourselves with the ldea of returning to Mitylene ori somo future day; but to me that doywill never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite vninteresting, and in justice to bis lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with humon nature, or contri6utlng ln any way to sooth its so rrows, or add to its pleaſures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from lhcse little anecdotes. Al1 the siner feelings of the h eart, so elegaritly depicted in hiſ lordship's poems, seem to bave thcir seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his aotions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reosonfor mclrking him as a beirig 0n whoseheart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose hcad Benevolence hath thrown her rnont1e. No man can read the precedirig pleasing \"traits\" without feeling pr0ud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. R eports are ever to bereceived wilh caution, particularly when dlrected against mon's moral integrity; arid ho who dares justify himself before that awful triburial where all must appear, alone may censure lhe errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy 0f his genius. To do good in secret, and shun lhe world'f applouse, is the suresltestimoriy of a virtuous heart and self-clpprovjng consclence.\n",

            "THE VAMPYRE;\n",
            "A Tale.\n",
            "By John William Polidori\n",
            "THE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\n",
            "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\n",
            "The universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\n",
            "Chief bailiff.\n",
            "This monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\n",
            "But first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn— But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away From spectre more accursed than they.\n",
            "Mr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pourtrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\n",
            "Many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\n",
            "THE VAMPYRE.\n",
            "IT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain:—when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;—even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\n",
            "About the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\n",
            "He watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\n",
            "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality;—the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;—these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\n",
            "They soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\n",
            "Aubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\n",
            "Having left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pourtray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\n",
            "Aubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\n",
            "Next morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, ere night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action;—he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound;—he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:—upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were—his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy—he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\n",
            "Aubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\n",
            "Aubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\n",
            "By promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! you may save me—you may do more than that—I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour.\"—\"How? tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey.—\"I need but little—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth—and if my death were unknown for some time in England—I—I—but life.\"—\"It shall not be known.\"—\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"—His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\n",
            "Aubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\n",
            "Weary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\n",
            "He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\n",
            "Miss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where'er a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes,—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\n",
            "The crowd was excessive—a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances started up in dreadful array—the dagger—his oath.—He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\n",
            "Aubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him;—was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\n",
            "Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre;—the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\n",
            "The time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he— But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath—he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\n",
            "Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount—could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;—could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;—in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\n",
            "Aubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\n",
            "Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\n",
            "The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\n",
            "EXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\n",
            "ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n",
            "\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\n",
            "IN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\n",
            "This account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\n",
            "The old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\n",
            "The appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\n",
            "On the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\n",
            "The view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\n",
            "Such was the information with which we departed from the peaceful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\n",

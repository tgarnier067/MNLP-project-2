Since we are dealing with a large number of models applied to 48 different texts — each containing approximately 60,000 characters — manually annotating the entire dataset would be prohibitively time-consuming. To make the evaluation process feasible while still obtaining meaningful insights, we opt for a lightweight annotation strategy. Specifically, we evaluate only three sentences per corrected text:\n",
